    "## OUTSTANDING WORK\n",
    "* Sync train-test split\n",
    "* Incorporate ALMA text preprocessing and compare performance to our preprocessing\n",
    "* Ensure measurements with width greater than 5GHz are dropped (I think this is only 2)\n",
    "* Band EDA\n",
    "* Remove outlier projects (> 26.5 measurement) from Band prediction\n",
    "* Remove projects that have incorrectly formatted band data\n",
    "    * E.G. 2011.0.00008.E has an observation line with band = '3 6'\n",
    "* Test different text preprocessing options and compare results\n",
    "* Consider removing bands 1 AND 2 from band prediction\n",
    "    * Only 21 measurements in band 1, no measurements in band 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Outline:\n",
    "We leverage two parallel pipelines, that are combined to recommend median frequencies to explore after each model has completed training and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "All projects for this phase of the overall pipeline are 'line' projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Frequency Mining Pipeline\n",
    "* OPTIONAL: remove projects with > 26.5 measurements **CURRENTLY REMOVING**\n",
    "    * Tested both options, hit rate accuracies did not increase significantly to offset 1k cluster add\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run projects through LDA to generate topic model with $N=50$ topics\n",
    "    * Currently using count vectorization of combined title and abstract with lemmatized_no_sw_text\n",
    "* Group projects to max topic by taking argmax of document-topic table\n",
    "* Run HDBSCAN on each of the topics to create measurement clusters, referred to as \"areas of interest\"\n",
    "    * Currently areas of interest are taken from min and max median frequency for each cluster generated\n",
    "    * NOTE: each of the 50 HDBSCAN models can (and probably should) be tuned individually\n",
    "        * We should make sure generated clusters are not too large unless it makes sense\n",
    "            * E.G. a large cluster from 700-750GHz might make sense since measurements in this range are generally sparse\n",
    "            * These large clusters are due to HDBSCAN adjusting the \"neighborhood size\", $\\epsilon$ dynamically (using heirarchical clustering underneath the hood) to account for areas of varying density, as opposed to DBSCAN which uses a flat $\\epsilon$ for all measurements within a topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Band Prediction Pipeline\n",
    "* OPTIONAL: remove projects with > 26.5 measurements **NOT CURRENTLY REMOVING NEED TO CHANGE**\n",
    "* Predict band for project with Naive Bayes\n",
    "    * Currently using TF-IDF vectorization of combined title and abstract with **NEED TO CHOOSE TEXT**\n",
    "* Choose band(s) using hard classification into one or two bands\n",
    "    * We remove band 2 entirely because there are so few \n",
    "    * We do this to be able to give a final hit rate of appx. 75%\n",
    "        * This shows we have a good prediction model to match projects to band\n",
    "* Ultimately we will use probability vector output (not hard classification) to order mined recommendations by full band prediction"
