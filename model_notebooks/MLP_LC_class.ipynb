The emergence of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium is a fundamental puzzle of astrochemistry.

We propose a Large Program to perform unbiased line surveys in the 279 to 312 GHz frequency range of 11 nearby Solar-type protostars. The targeted protostars are known hosts of complex organic molecules and sample different natal environments and evolutionary stages. The proposed spectral coverage will allow us to unambiguously identify complex organic molecules and their isotopologues and to accurately derive the abundances for species with abundances down to 0.01% relative to methanol. The concerted effort will provide a deep understanding of the complex organic inventories and isotopic ratios depending on the physical environment and evolutionary past. This will move the field forward in disentangling the formation of such molecules under interstellar conditions and ultimately address how much diversity in organic inventories we can expect for emerging planetary systems.'"]},"execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["full_data.iloc[1].combo_text"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(4528, 7)"]},"execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["full_data.shape"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# train test split\n","trX, ttX, trY, ttY = train_test_split(full_data['combo_text'], full_data['class'], test_size=1000, random_state=seed)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["2608    1\n","2664    1\n","3890    1\n","789     1\n","4433    0\n","       ..\n","238     1\n","4243    1\n","1862    1\n","2413    1\n","242     1\n","Name: class, Length: 3528, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["trY"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["trX = trX.str.replace(\"\\'\", '')\n","ttX = ttX.str.replace(\"\\'\", '')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["trX = trX.to_numpy()\n","ttX = ttX.to_numpy()\n","trY = np.float32(trY)\n","ttY = np.float32(ttY)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["['Skimming the Surface: An Absorption Study of HDO in a Young Protoplanetary Disk. Cold water vapor revealed by energetic UV photodesorption of icy mantles in the outskirts of protoplanetary disks provides a unique view into the composition of their largely invisible ice reservoir. Surface water (H2O) emission has been detected via this mechanism, however interpretation requires uncertain excitation modeling to derive a column. Based upon our Herschel PACS observations of water towards the young and inclined protoplanetary disk, RY Tau, we find that the data are strongly suggestive of deep unresolved self-absorption. We propose an experiment to measure HDO in absorption against the dusty continuum to determine the column density of cold HDO vapor and thereby obtain the first estimate of the D/H ratio in a young planet-forming disk with ALMA. If this photodesorbed layer is representative of the ices themselves, which grow and settle out over time, we are directly probing the composition of the gas that becomes incorporated into planetesimals, comets, etc., i.e. the building blocks of planetary systems. Such observations will provide important constraints on the initial HDO/H2O ratio of disk ices down to Earths ocean-levels (VSMOW) and potentially lower.',\n"," 'Carbon fractionation at redshift z=0.89. Isotopic ratios are powerful probes of the nucleosynthesis history of a galaxy, and the spectroscopic study of absorption lines toward bright background continuum sources provides a powerful technique to investigate them. Such absorption studies require a foreground galaxy in the line of sight to e.g. a quasar, and the most famous such system is the molecular absorber at z=0.89 towards PKS 1830-211. A range of isotopic ratios have been measured in this galaxy, and they are found to differ significantly from ratios in the Milky Way. However, potential fractionation has not been taken into account. Models show some molecules are more vulnerable to fractionation, such as CO, HCN, and HNC. Other molecules, such as CN and HCO+, are expected to reflect the true isotopic ratio. In order to study the 12C/13C fractionation in the molecular absorber at z=0.89, we will target the carbon-bearing molecules HCN, HNC, HCO+ and CN, and their 13C isotopologues. We will constrain the level of fractionation in the gas and derive the true 12C/13C isotopic ratio. This will also allow us to use previously measured double ratios to extract the isotopic ratios 14N/15N and 16O/18O.',\n"," 'A legacy survey of Wolf-Rayet star winds. The powerful and highly ionized winds of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars emit free-free radiation and recombination lines from the radio to near-IR. Despite being bright at sub-mm wavelengths, few suitable observations have been made in the gap between radio and near-IR wavelengths to characterise the wind properties and compare with models. We propose to use ACA in Bands 3 and 6 (92 and 263GHz) to build a catalogue of mm/sub-mm spectral indices and flux densities of the winds of 57 of the brightest Galactic WR stars. This will be used to identify potential new high-frequency calibration sources for ALMA (to increase the number of phase calibrators available for high frequency bands), investigate statistical trends and compare with wind emission models, and use to select sources and plan future high spatial resolution imaging of the wind morphologies. The catalogue and images will have a strong legacy value to the evolved massive star community.',\n"," 'High-mass disk formation and fragmentation. Understanding the fragmentation and rotation properties of disks around young high-mass stars remains one of the key questions in star formation research. The unique capabilities of ALMA allow us to probe the physical properties of the gas and dust in the inner envelope and disk region around the central high-mass star. Specifically, using the long baselines in the 1.3mm band result in a spatial resolution of ~0.05, allowing us for the first time to resolve the predicted fragmentation scales on the order of ~100AU. Therefore, we propose to observe one of the best 10^5 Lsun high-mass disk/outflow candidates G351.77-0.54 at 230GHz in continuum and spectral line emission. Important questions which these observations will address are: What are the fragmentation properties of this massive disk candidate? Are the kinematic properties of the disk-like structure of Keplerian nature dominated by the central object or still strongly influenced by a flattened envelope? Are outflow properties, e.g., possible outflow rotation, directly linked to those of the accretion disk?',\n"," 'Occultation of the radio galaxy J1513-4221 by the asteroid (61) Danae. Occultations of radio sources by asteroids provide an effective method of determining asteroid sizes and positions at the moment of the observation. The method is based on the modelling of diffraction fringes using the Fresnel-Kirchhoff theory. We propose to use ALMA to determine the size of asteroid (61) Danae, and to confirm, or disprove, the suggested existence of a moon around this asteroid. The orbit of the eventual moon around the primary body can be used to constrain the mass and the density of the asteroid. So far the statistics about these parameters are poor for these kind of asteroids. Here we wish to utilize the fortuitous occultation of the radio source J1513-422 by Danae that will be observable at ALMA on July 18, 2019. The proposed short measurement would be the first of its kind with a connected array, and it would constitute a very useful test for this powerful method.',\n"," 'Physical Conditions of SSC Formation in Henize 2-10. Super star clusters (SSCs) are consistent with being the progenitors of globular clusters, so understanding the conditions of their formation provides insight into star formation during the era of galaxy assembly. To understand the environment and conditions of SSC formation, it is essential to observe the earliest stages that are only observable at mm wavelengths, before stars form and disrupt the natal material. Johnson et al. 2018 identified a population of molecular clouds that may have the necessary properties to form SSCs in Henize 2-10, a dwarf starburst galaxy with several well-studied SSCs, but this data had too low a resolution to confirm them. This population includes clouds at a range of formation stages, including several with no associated thermal radio emission, indicating that massive star formation has not yet begun. Our proposed observations and non-LTE fitting technique will constrain the masses, sizes, temperatures, densities, substructure, and kinematics of these clouds. We will be able to confirm if this population has any pre-SSC clouds and compare the SSC formation process in a dwarf starbust to other environments, such as the major merger Antennae galaxies.',\n"," 'A Comprehensive [CII] Survey of Herschel-Selected Starbursts at z=1-2. Based on recent surveys of the most luminous massive starburst galaxies found in >1000deg2 observed with Herschel, a comprehensive sample of >300 sources with secure, CO/CI-based spectroscopic redshifts now exists. Here we propose to detect [CII] 158um emission from the star-forming ISM in all 37 galaxies in this sample at z=1-2 that are observable with the ACA, complementing 102 galaxies at z=3-6 already observed or scheduled in cycle 7-9, providing the (by almost an order of magnitude) largest massive starburst [CII] sample. In combination with the rich suite of diagnostics already available, this study will provide critical insight into the physical properties of the ISM that set the conditions for star formation for a statistically significant sample. Based on >10 systems in the sample for which <=1kpc resolution [CII] imaging with the ALMA 12m array is available, the ACA data will also provide a critical test for the potential presence of low surface brightness emission on >10kpc scales due to an enriched cold circum-galactic medium missed by high-resolution studies, as has been suggested to exist in star-forming galaxies in the early universe by some recent theoretical work.',\n"," 'Detection of Extragalactic Millimeter-Wavelength Transient Sources with SPT-3G. Experiments designed to survey the cosmic microwave background provide a unique opportunity to study the time-variable sky at millimeter wavelengths. The first results from the SPT-3G transient detection pipeline have yielded two long-duration transient (LDT) events with timescales of 2-3 weeks each and flare amplitudes of 4x and 15x their quiescent fluxes. These transients appear to be associated with WISE galaxies at photometric redshifts of z = 0.37/0.68 and z = 0.97. Current observational evidence would be compatible with low-luminosity jet-dominated AGN flares or tidal disruption events, though the extreme flare variability and lack of radio detection makes them peculiar. In this proposal, we are asking for ALMA Band 3 measurements in order to establish accurate positions for the two LDTs. The increased resolution afforded by ALMA will disambiguate which WISE sources are associated with the SPT-3G transient sources, and lay the groundwork for future followup.',\n"," 'Understanding the Origins and Dynamics of the Multiple Outflows Around IRAS 16293-2422. Jets and outflows are the most obvious signposts of ongoing star formation, when the accretion during the Class 0 phase powers bipolar ejections perpendicular to the forming disk. Many nearby star-forming regions show multiple bipolar outflows coming from a single protostellar core, which is a sign for the formation of multiple protostars. This proposal aims at getting the first complete picture of the interaction, morphology and kinematics of outflows within such a protostellar system. We target IRAS 16293-2422, one of the best-studied Class 0 systems. It consists of a protobinary (Source A and B), separated by 600AU. Source A is also a binary system with a separation of 36AU. Our aim is to fully resolve all known sources and their outflows in both the velocity and spatial domain to understand the interplay between the outflows, the ambient medium and the forming stars. To pursue that goal we target CO(3-2) and 13CO(3-2) - to get the full dynamics of the outflow - CS(7-6) and C34S(7-6) - to get the infall motions towards the sources, and the dynamics of the dense gas in the disk - and SiO(8-7) - a shock tracer to understand the interaction of the outflows with the quiescent gas.',\n"," 'The first detection of the [OIII]88um from Two QSO host galaxies in the reionization epoch. To understand the coevolution of blackholes and host galaxies, it is crucial to investigate properties of QSO host galaxies at the reionization epoch (z>=6). Here we propose ALMA Band8 observations of two QSO host galaxies at z=6.0, SDSS J2310+1855 and SDSS J054-0005, targeting the [OIII]88um line and dust continuum emission. The objects have the highest [CII]158um line luminosities among QSO host galaxies at z>=6.0, making them the best targets for follow-up observations of [OIII]. We aim the first [OIII] line detections from QSO host galaxies at the reionization epoch. With the line ratios of [OIII]/[CII], we examine ionization parameters of host galaxies. In addition, our dust continuum data will allow us to place strong constraints on dust temperature and on dust masses. Our proposal will allow us to perform systematic comparisons of ionization parameters and dust properties between QSO host galaxies and star-forming galaxies at the reionization epoch, highlighting the difference or similarity between the two galaxy populations.',\n"," 'Revealing the 12C/13C ratio across the galactocentric radius through sensitive absorption detection. It has long been proposed that the 12C/13C isotopic ratio can be used as a diagnostic for the evolutionary stage of stars and galaxies. The current Galactic 12C/13C gradient by Milam et al. (2005) has been frequently used in various astrochemistry works. However, their work does not consider the contribution from CMB temperature, and the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation used in their analysis is not suitable for millimeter wavelengths. Correcting for all of these effects, we found that the values of 12C/13C ratio are up to 50% smaller than the previous ones. We propose here to measure the 12C/13C ratio through sensitive absorption observations toward five quasars. Each of the sightline has more than three velocity components, which trace gas components at different spiral arms. With the proposed sensitivity, we will be able to measure the HCO+/H13CO+ ratio at different galactocentric radii. Our aims are: 1) to reveal the Galactic 12C/13C gradient through this independent measurements, 2) to measure the fractionation effect on the 12C/13C ratio in diffuse clouds, and 3) to measure the photodissociation effect on the 12C/13C ratio.',\n"," 'The dark side of the Web of the Giant. Theory predicts that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z>6 should form and evolve within the densest environments at that time. These environments are expected to be traced by Mpc-sized galaxy overdensities, but the observational evidence is still disputed. Among all QSOs at z>5.7, the field around the z=6.31 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524 features the best multi-band coverage, which allowed the first discovery of a >Mpc-scale large scale structure (LSS) around a SMBH at cosmic dawn. We propose to obtain mm spectra with ALMA and search for [CII]158um emission in 16 candidate and confirmed LSS members. This approach has proven to be superior in terms of redshift precision and time investment to optical spectroscopy with 8-10m class telescopes. With the proposed sensitivity, we will secure [CII] detections in all targeted sources that belong to the overdensity, and expect to triple the number of known LSS members. This will i) tremendously improve our knowledge of the overdensity level, volume and mass of this unique structure, and ii) allow the first statistical study of the physical properties (total SFR, dust mass, and possibly dynamical mass) of its member galaxies.',\n"," 'The Shape of Things to Come: Planetary Influence on the Inner Edge of the Closest Debris Disc. Epsilon Eridani is the 3rd nearest Sun-like star to our Sun and the nearest one known to host a debris disc. This proximity makes it a prime system for understanding dynamical interactions between planets and a disc. In cycle 2 we observed the northern part of its debris ring and resolved the width of the ring for the first time, finding it to be just 13 AU wide. Based on the narrowness of the ring, we proposed that a planet of around 0.4 Jupiter masses is likely located at 48 AU. We also noticed low level emission just interior to the main belt that could either be described by a steeply rising inner edge of the belt or an extra component just interior to the main belt. In order to determine more precise parameters of this planet and understand how it is interacting with the ring, we propose to image the entire ring with 6 pointings in order to determine the shape of the inner edge of the ring and use this to predict the mass and location of the outermost planet in the system. By observing the whole ring, these observations will also allow us to constrain the eccentricity of the ring, which can in turn constrain the eccentricity of the outermost planet.',\n"," 'Disks, winds, and tori -- towards a comprehensive view of the AGN environment with VLTI and ALMA. We explore the origin of dusty molecular outflows in AGN by combining data from the highest angular resolution IR and sub-mm facilities VLTI and ALMA. Using VLTI we recently showed that the \"dusty torus\" region is much more complex than models assume: Radiation pressure may drive a clumpy wind that forms a polar outflow. This outflow seems responsible for the bulk of the mid-IR emission seen on <10 pc scales of nearby Seyfert galaxies and may be the origin of kpc-scale molecular outflows invoked in AGN feedback. While this disk+wind picture emerged from detailed VLTI observations, it lacks an exploration of its physical implications: dense molecular gas orbits the black hole and dense clouds are ejected into the outflow. In this pilot study we will observe NGC 3783, the poster child of the pc-scale \"dusty outflows\", by mapping the kinematics of high-density tracer lines HCN(4-3), CO(3-2) & CO(4-3), CS(7-6), and HCO+(4-3). Do we see the dense rotational disk? Can we prove a significant outflow? And does the IR dust emission trace the high-density regions? These questions can only be solved directly with the unprecedented exploitation of maximal angular resolution of ALMA and VLTI.',\n"," 'First characterisation of a multi-planetary system at the stage of formation. Many questions regarding planet formation are still open, in particular how material is accreted from the protoplanetary disk onto the forming planet through its circumplanetary disk (CPD). PDS 70 is a unique source to investigate such processes as it hosts two planetary companions within an inner cavity. These sources, PDS 70b and c, were robustly detected with SPHERE (infrared) and MUSE (Halpha). The analysis of ALMA Band 7 observations, at an angular resolution of 70 mas, indicates continuum emission at the location of the planets and represents the very first detection of a CPD. However, higher resolution observations at 30mas are required to confirm the presence of these two CPD and spatially resolve the CPD around PDS 70c from the edge of the continuum ring. In addition, substructure within the dust ring and a peak of CO emission offset from the bulk Keplerian profile strongly suggests the presence of a third companion of the disk. The requested observations would also allow for the characterization of substructure within the dust ring, required to confirm the presence of a third companion.',\n"," 'Search for Interstellar Pyrimidine. Many interstellar complex organic molecules are known to be prebiotically important and have essential functions in terrestrial biochemistry. Pyrimidine, the building block of nucleic acid, has been detected in meteorites and is hence a key molecule for astrochemistry and astrobiology. Given the fundamental importance of interstellar pyrimidine, we thus propose to observe nine most favorable pyrimidine bandheads and five strong low-J doublets in the Orion KL hot molecular core with ALMA in Band 7. Although the formation of prebiotic molecules in extraterrestrial environment and their contribution to the origin of life remains unsettled, the connection between interstellar organic chemistry, meteoritic pyrimidines, and the emergence of life on early Earth would be strengthened with the discovery of interstellar pyrimidine.',\n"," 'Linking the Resolved Filamentary Molecular ISM to Massive Star Formation across M33. Milky Way studies show that the molecular ISM is filamentary on few pc scales, including recent discoveries of large-scale galactic filaments, but coarse resolution in extragalactic observations has stifled direct comparisons beyond the Milky Way. We propose observations to enable this comparison with complete mapping of M33s inner star-forming disc (25 kpc2) to resolve filamentary molecular clouds on 4 pc scales, down to masses of 900 Msol (5-sigma). We will efficiently detect widespread 12CO & 13CO(2-1) to (1) identify how galactic structure shapes the molecular ISM morphology in different environments (centre vs. spiral arms vs. inter-arms); (2) trace molecular clouds from formation to dispersal, building a resolved view of the molecular cloud lifecycle; (3) resolve whether filamentary morphology influences where massive star form, testing predictions from competing star formation theories. This survey enters a new regime in molecular cloud studies by resolving similar scales to Galactic plane surveys across a complete external star-forming disc. Combined with HST, VLA, and Cycle 1 JWST observations, these data will be a definitive legacy product for molecular cloud studies.',\n"," 'CK Vul: Unravelling a 350-year old mystery.

ALMA will add an important piece that will help us to complete the CK Vul jig-saw puzzle.',\n"," 'Unveiling the outflow mechanisms in transitional millisecond pulsars: the ultimate observing campaign of PSR J1023+0038. The discovery of three millisecond pulsars that swing between an accretion and a rotation powered state has challenged our comprehension of the evolution of accreting neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. We are coordinating the most extensive ever, strictly simultaneous, multiband campaign of the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 during its current peculiar X-ray sub-luminous accretion disk state. We propose to observe this system with ALMA simultaneously with other telescopes to: i) assess whether the mm emission displays similar variability as observed at lower frequencies; ii) determine the spectral slope in the radio-mm-near infrared domain to probe the presence of a jet (and determine its properties) and to gain insight into the role of a putative pulsar wind in driving radio flares. The ALMA observations will be crucial to nail down conclusively the connection between mass accretion and ejection in this system and in the transitional millisecond pulsars in general. This ultimate campaign will advance our knowledge on the details of the process by which neutron stars evolve from the initial accretion state to the final rotation-powered radio pulsar state.',\n"," 'The Formation of High-Mass Binaries and Their Accretion Disks. High-mass stars (>8Msun) are preferentially found in binary systems. So far, there are no definitive observational constraints to identify which are the dominant physical mechanisms explaining the binarity of high-mass stars: core fragmentation, disk fragmentation, and/or multiple-body interactions. At the same time, the evidence of (Keplerian) accretion disks around high-mass stars is growing. However, no systematic study at the required spatial resolutions to resolve disks (<100 au) have been carried out. Based on the experience gained in a pilot survey and taking advantage of the unique ALMA capabilities, we will statistically (1) test the scenarios that explain the binarity of high-mass stars, and (2) search and characterize accretion disks around high-mass stars. Using dust continuum at ~230 GHz and including several tracers of disk kinematics (hot core, salt, and recombination lines), we will observe a uniform sample of 71 high-mass star-forming regions between 2 and 3 kpc, reaching an unprecedented spatial resolution (~50 au).

We propose a comprehensive study of water lines in the brightest sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) on the Southern sky from the Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey (BEARS), more than tripling the number of H2O detections in SMGs, in order to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and test for drivers of starburst mode vs main sequence stellar mass assembly in the ramp-up to Cosmic Noon. Water is the most abundant molecule in star-forming galaxies after H2 and CO, and is an important coolant of warm gas with line luminosities comparable to CO. The H2O transitions are driven by pumping from far-IR photons, so the H2O line luminosities correlate linearly with far-IR luminosity and are hence the best tracer of SFR over >3 orders of magnitude. The H2O and CO line profiles are very similar, and resolved CO and H2O studies show they are co-spatial, implying that gravitational lens magnifications derived from CO morphologies can be applied also to H2O lines, and that differential magnification between H2O and CO can be neglected.',\n"," 'Protostellar Multiplicity in Isolation. Multiple star systems are a common outcome of star formation. While the multiplicity frequency and separation distribution are well-characterized for field stars, theoretical studies predict that the majority of multiple systems form very early in the protostellar phase and undergo significant and rapid dynamical evolution. Thus knowledge of the intrinsic multiplicity fraction and separation distribution before modification via dynamical evolution requires studying the youngest objects: protostars still embedded in and accreting from their parent cores. Recent surveys have made great progress in characterizing protostellar multiplicity in clustered environments but have left unanswered a key question: does the formation of multiple systems depend on environment? Here we propose an ALMA band 6 multiplicity survey of 31 truly isolated protostellar cores down to approximately 25 AU resolution in order to measure the protostellar multiplicity fraction and separation distribution in isolated globules and determine the effects of environment on fragmentation.',\n"," 'Breaking the Degeneracy - Robustly constraining dust temperatures in z~5 galaxies with Band 9 observations. Measuring the evolution of the dust temperature (Tdust) in star-forming galaxies is key to understanding how their dust, interstellar medium, and obscured star formation properties changed across cosmic time. While dust temperatures of nearby and moderately high-z galaxies are well constrained, at z > 4 we are still limited to Tdust values based on stacks of galaxies (which are hard to interpret), or from single sources with dust spectral energy distributions (SED) that do not detect the peak - the most sensitive part of the SED to changes in Tdust. Our goal is to detect for the first time the peak of the dust SED in two main-sequence galaxies at z~5 using Band 9. These targets already have the rising portion of the SED detected from Bands 6, 7 and 8. Our proposed Band 9 observations will add the key missing point required to obtain robust dust temperatures, which will translate into reliable measurements of the infrared luminosity, obscured star formation activity, and dust properties of normal star-forming galaxies at z~5 - all fundamental in the context of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Black Hole Masses, central parsec gas dynamics, and Event Horizon Detectability in a sample of nearby galaxies. Resubmission: 2 galaxies delivered. 6 remain to be observed in Cycle 4. Despite it now being well established that nearly all galaxies have a central black hole whose mass scales with the host galaxy properties, we do not have a complete understanding of the physics at work. In particular, we do not know whether black holes, or galaxies, drive the scaling relations. Although we know that the M-sigma and M-L relations are incompatible in the largest galaxies, we do not know which is wrong. We are now at the limits of what can be learned with ~80 data points with substantial measurement uncertainties, and urgently require additional precision data. ALMA is capable of measuring black hole masses at high precision in a large sample. We propose observations of a modest pilot sample of nearby galaxies in order to: (1) Measure black hole masses in 3 new sources with large angular spheres of influence, (2) measure the central parsec gas dynamics in most or all 8 sources allowing us to better understand the systematics in molecular line black hole mass measurements, and (3) determine suitability for event horizon shadow resolution with the Event Horizon Telescope.',\n"," 'Weighing Low Mass Black Holes in the Nearest AGN. We propose to use ALMA to make the first robust dynamical detections of ~10^5 solar mass central black holes in two nearby galaxies.

Our targets are two active galactic nuclei (AGN) at D < 5 Mpc, and both show clear evidence from near-infrared observations of rotating molecular disks surrounding their black holes.

Observations of the cool gas are crucial for understanding the triggering of luminous AGN and the impact they have on their host galaxies. ALMA opens a new window on the cool ISM in AGN via sensitive observations of the CO emission lines. Here we propose to use the most compact configurations of ALMA to make deep CO(1-0) observations of a complete sample of 29 luminous radio AGN at low-to-intermediate redshifts (0.05 < z < 0.3) for which we have already obtained multi-wavelength data of unprecedented depth and completeness from X-ray to far-IR wavelengths. The observations will be used to: (a) quantify the molecular gas contents of the host galaxies and thereby estiablish whether the triggering mergers are gas-rich or gas-poor; (b) investigate the causes of the observed diversity in AGN properties for a given radio power; and (c) determine whether the feedback effect of radio jets directly influences the star formation efficiencies in the host galaxies. As well as filling a key gap in our understanding of how radio AGN tie in with the evolution of massive early-type galaxies, the observations will also provide an important low-z benchmark for high-z studies of cool gas in AGN.',\n"," 'Completing 2.6-mm and 1.3-mm spectral scans toward the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068.

This galaxy shows prominent molecular gas concentrations along the grand-design spiral arms and bar-ends (Starburst Ring) and around the AGN (Circumnuclear disk), and thus an ideal laboratory to study the impact of AGN and star formation on the host galaxys ISM and their interplay through mm/sub-mm lines. Because of its close distance (~13.7 Mpc) and the clear AGN/starburst contrast, NGC 1068 is one of the most studied extragalactic system with molecular lines. Indeed, ALMA has been observing this galaxy every cycle from cycle 0 that results in extremely rich ALMA 12m array archive in Band 3 and Band 6. However, lacking short spacing data (i.e., ACA) have a strong impact on the line flux measurements. This is critical in the context of astrochemistry because it prevents from measuring accurate line fluxes, i.e., column densities, from region to region of NGC 1068. The purpose of this proposal is to complete the Band 3 and Band 6 spectral scans by adding short-spacing information.',\n"," 'When the Very Large Telescope is not large enough: spectrosopic identification of z~4 massive galaxies. We have recently built the ALMA Redshift 4 Survey, 870um observations of 100 galaxies at z=4, selected solely from their stellar mass in the deep CANDELS fields. These exquisite data allowed us to constrain the star formation mode of massive galaxies in the early Universe, and we will further investigate their dust attenuation properties and star formation geometry in future works. However, the main source of uncertainty is the derivation of the redshifts, based on the UV-to-NIR broadband photometry. The ALMA detections show very red SEDs, and many lack a strong break from which the redshift can be reliably guessed. NIR spectroscopy with the VLT (KMOS) was obtained with 6h on-source integration: no emission line was found. At this stage, the only way to obtain the spectroscopic identification of these objects is to target sub-mm lines, and ALMA is the most efficient tool to achieve this. As part of a pilot program, we propose here to observe 3 of our brightest galaxies and scan CO lines with an original and efficient setup to unambiguously determine their redshifts. In addition to its obvious legacy value, this program will pave the way for future more extensive campaigns.',\n"," 'Are the most massive z >4 galaxies hidden from HST ?. Our current understanding on the cosmic star formation history at z > 4 is primarily based on UV-selected galaxies. A critical question is then whether we are missing a significant population of massive, UV-faint galaxies. By crossmatching HST/WFC3 and IRAC data in the three CANDELS-Herschel fields, we perform a systematic search of galaxies which are bright in IRAC but are not detected in the WFC3 H band, i.e., H-dropouts, which are likely at z > 4 where the H band probes the rest-frame UV. In total, we identify 64 H-dropouts down to [4.5] < 24, corresponding to M*~10^{10.8} Msun at z > 4. Both photometric redshifts and stacked infrared SED suggest that most of them are at z > 4, with LIR~2*10^{12} Lsun. These galaxies likely represent 30-40\\\\% of the most massive galaxies at z > 4, but were completely missed in previous studies based on either UV or near-infrared selected samples.

Poloidal magnetic field is expected in protostellar disks, if magnetic flux is dragged into the disks from star-forming dense cores. Such a poloidal field can play a key role in disk evolution and jet launching. However, direct evidence for its existence has been lacking. Here, we propose to follow up on our previous project to resolve the B-field morphology and search for poloidal field in the young, edge-on, and resolvable disks in two nearby disk-jet systems, HH 212 and HH 111, using polarization observation of thermal dust emission. If detected, it would mean that some of the core magnetic flux is indeed dragged into the disks and the poloidal field can indeed play a key role in both disk evolution and jet launching. A negative result would cast serious doubt on the poloidal-field driven disk evolution and jet launching. It would also imply that the long-standing ``magnetic flux problem is somehow resolved at large distances beyond the disks. To have the best chance of polarization detection, we request 2 Science Goals in Band 7 at 345 GHz at 0.035\"-0.04\" angular resolution.

One of the key questions that ALMA will address is how circumstellar disks form around low-mass protostars and how their physics and chemistry evolve until the planet-forming stages. We here propose to observe a range of transitions from isotopologues of common molecular species (H13CO+, C34S) and of complex organic molecules tracing the inner few hundred AU of two embedded low-mass protostars. These observations will address two coupled questions about low-mass star formation prompted by recent ground-based submillimeter interferometric observations: what is the origin of complex organic molecules around low-mass protostars and when are rotationally supported disks formed around such sources? This is made possible with the angular resolution and sensitivity offered by ALMA in its extended array in cycle 0. A key facet of these observations will be the spatial resolution and the sensitivity to reveal emission from complex molecules and relate those to the density distribution and kinematical profile revealed in H13CO+ and C34S on few hundred AU scales.',\n"," 'Investigating the impact of the most powerful outflows known. We propose high-angular resolution band-6 observations of the CO(7-6) line and continuum emission in two dusty-obscured quasars at z=2.4.

Recent low-resolution ALMA observations also reveal large-scale (~20 kpc) cold gas halos around these quasars, likely created by outflows. Observations with a spatial resolution of ~850pc will enable us to map the dense molecular gas and dust in the quasar host galaxies and test whether the fast outflows really deplete gas and dust in the nuclear region within 2 kpc from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as expected by recent cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. The CO(7-6) observations will also be used to quantify the impact of outflows on the gas kinematics and SMBH growth.

AGNs host hot plasma, namely coronae, emitting intense X-ray photons. Like the Sun, these coronae are believed to be heated by their magnetic activity. However, coronal magnetic activity in AGNs have never been measured. Utilizing ALMA Cycle-4 observations (#2016:1:01140:S), we have successfully detected coronal radio synchrotron emission from a nearby Seyfert galaxy IC 4329A. This discovery has been first achieved by ALMAs high angular resolutions and sensitivity at the millimeter bands. The inferred magnetic field strength is of ~10 Gauss on scales of ~40 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole, which are key parameters for understanding of corona heating and jet launching. Here, we request ALMA Band-3, 4, and 6 observations toward nine Seyferts in order to establish the ubiquitousness of coronal magnetic activity in Seyferts. By establishing the existence of coronal synchrotron emission with this survey, ALMA will open a new observational window for the study of AGN accretion physics.

Spatially-resolved studies of multiple molecular line transitions are powerful tools to investigate the impact of radio jets on the physics and kinematics of the surrounding gas, and nearby objects are exceptional laboratories for this kind of analysis. Such studies are however very sparse and mostly focused on Seyfert galaxies. We propose a multi-species, spatially-resolved study of the radio galaxy NGC 3100 (z~0.009). From previous ALMA Cycle 3 12^CO(2-1) observations in Band 6 we detected a well-resolved disc of 1.6x0.45 kpc^2. The CO disc appears disrupted along the jet axis and hints of non-circular motions (i.e. outflow) are observed along the disc minor axis. These findings make NGC~3100 a best candidate for a detailed jet-cold gas interaction study. We ask to observe other two CO transitions in Band 3 and 7, as well as dense (HCO+ in Band 7) and shock (SiO, HNCO in Band 4) gas tracers. Through these observations we will characterize the physical conditions of the different kinematical components of the molecular gas in different regions of NGC~3100, and assess the impact of the radio jets on the kinematics and chemistry of the immediately surrounding environment.',\n"," 'Spatial constraints on the cold dust in the shell around the AGB star V644 Sco. We propose to observe the shell around the carbon AGB star V644 Sco with the ACA in bands 6 and 7. In spatially unresolved observations with LABOCA on APEX towards V644 Sco, we detect a similar excess flux also detected in the shell around the AGB star R Scl. The submm observations towards R Scl are spatially resolved, and indicate that the excess flux originates from a cold dust component with large grains at 30 K, possibly revealing a large reservoir of dust mass from AGB stars. The lack of spatial constraints for V644 Sco severely limits the interpretation of the APEX data. The ACA observations will spatially resolve the shell around V644 Sco. They will effectively constrain the grain properties in the shell around this star by measuring the spectral index in the submm. The proposed observations offer a unique opportunity to study the contribution from AGB stars to the total galactic dust budget. If the large grains are confirmed also in V644 Sco, it would imply that our view on dust production in the Galaxy would have to be adjusted.',\n"," 'Scrutinizing a dense molecular torus in the archetypal AGN NGC 1068. We propose ALMA 0.012\" (<1 pc)-resolution band-7 (275-370 GHz) HCN J=4-3 line observations of the nucleus of the nearby (14 Mpc) archetypal luminous AGN, NGC 1068. Previously obtained ALMA data of HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 lines in band 6 (211-275 GHz) clearly revealed a long-sought-after east-west-oriented, rotating dense molecular torus in NGC 1068. However, it was also found that the dense molecular torus looks counter-rotating between inner and outer part, much more complicated than a classical torus picture. We aim to better scrutinize a cloud-collision scenario toward the western torus from the far side, by combining the proposed high-angular-resolution HCN J=4-3 line data with existing data. Our ultimate goal is to obtain an important clue about how to fuel a central supermassive black hole in the luminous AGN population, by removing angular momentum in the torus.',\n"," 'Water cycles: tracing D/H in an embedded protostellar disk. The D/H ratio of water vapor has long been used as a key fingerprint to trace the origin of Earths water. However, the overall understanding of water D/H in the solar system is uncertain. The classical paradigm indicates that deuterium fractionation is temperature dependent, which predicts an overall radial gradient (low D/H close to the star and higher values at greater distances). This gradient may be imparted on forming solar system solids. However, recent work shows plausible mechanisms for local deuterium enhancement. A pilot study of the HOPS-370 protostar and its disk offers a simple opportunity to test this theory. This source has a kinematically isolated 100 au disk as inferred from ALMA observations, along with NOEMA detections of H218O, HDO, and CH3CN (priv. comm.). The latter molecule is an excellent probe of the temperature. We propose to use ALMA and resolve the disk with multiple beams inside the water snowline to search for radial gradients in the water D/H ratio.',\n"," 'Molecular gas associated with the LMC Supernova remnants. We propose molecular gas observation of three supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The LMC offers a unique opportunity for studying SNRs because we can see objects without distance uncertainty and confusion by foreground or background material. We have selected three SNRs that are similar with our Cycle 2 observed SNR (N132D in the LMC) in X-ray morphology but the age and luminous bands are different. The primary goal of our ALMA observation is to detect defuse molecular slumps around these SNRs at resolutions higher than 1 pc. With this resolution, we will reveal the relation with thermal/non-thermal X-ray enhancement with shock interaction by comparing clumpy molecular gas with filamentary X-ray of Chandra. We will clarify the universality of X-ray emitting mechanism around the SNRs by compare the results of three SNRs with N132D, and the galactic studies.',\n"," 'A Challenge towards the First Detection of Interstellar Glycine. We propose to observe G10.47+0.03 with five lines of Glycine (NH2CH2COOH) in band4. We have found that G10.47+0.03 has the richest abundance of methylamine (CH3NH2), a precursor to glycine, whose abundance is about one order of magnitude higher than that in SgrB2(N). Since the observed abundances of CH2NH and CH3NH2 can be well explained with the model by Garrod (2013), the first detection of glycine would be plausible with the brightness temperatures of about 160mK, based on the predicted abundance of glycine by Garrod (2013). G10.47+0.03 shows narrower linewidth than SgrB2(N), smaller probability of line contamination would be expected. Once successful, we will be able to open a new era of astrochemistry and astrobiology in that many researchers would join in finding other amino acids and\\\\/or other prebiotic molecules.',\n"," 'Investigating grain growth in a structureless protoplanetary disk. Substructures acting as dust traps in protoplanetary disks are the currently accepted solution to the fast radial drift of mm/cm-sized grains, which would otherwise deplete the disk of large grains quickly and prevent planet formation. A puzzling source in this context is the evolved (3-17 Myr) protoplanetary disk around the nearby (100 pc) solar analog MP Mus: despite its age, 1.3 mm archival ALMA observations do not reveal any substructure down to 6 au scales. Here we propose to obtain 3 mm observations with a similar angular resolution to investigate whether large grains are present in the disk. Combined with the existing 1.3 mm data, this will result in a spatial map of the disk spectral index (sensitive to grain sizes), enable detailed modeling of the dust properties and disk structure, and allow us to search for substructures at optically thinner wavelengths. If large grains are found in the disk, then very small ($<6 au) unresolved substructures may be responsible for stopping their migration. On the other hand, if only small grains remain, this could imply than planets need to form much faster than expected before mm-sized grains disappear from the disk.',\n"," 'The Dynamics of the 200au Disk in the O-Type Protostar G17.64+0.16. At the very highest resolution available to ALMA (20mas) we imaged the continuum emission, finding an elongated structure, the dust disk, around G17.64+0.16 in Cycle 5. Now we wish to image deeper to detect the molecular line emission and study the dynamics. G17.64+0.16 is thought to be a proto-O-star (>10^5Lo) and we confirmed it is surrounded by a cold dust disk, in agreement with multi-baseline IR interferometry indicating a hot dust disk. In protostellar models, G17 is in a late phase, contracting from a swollen configuration to a main-sequence configuration with a radiative stellar envelope now driving a wide angle `disk wind. Our Cycle 2 data indicate that SiO is tracing this rotating disk-wind (similar to Orion Source I). We have detected, and resolved the disk in the continuum emission but we do not detect SiO at the highest velocities. We wish to map much deeper to understand the dynamics of the disk from the resolved molecular line emission - this will allow us to (1) confirm the O-star nature from the velocity pattern, (2) investigate for the presence of a binary, (3) Provide insights into te spiral features - due to gravitational instabilities or a binary.',\n"," 'Feeding and feedback in an unbiased and representative sample of AGN in the local Universe. We will map CO(2-1)in the central 3 Kpc of a representative and unbiased sample of 34 AGN in the Local Universe (D=10-50Mpc), from the 12µm all-sky sample. This is crucial to quantify the global AGN feeding and feedback and measure the time-averaged impact of these processes-the key unknown in theories of galaxy evolution. We will detect molecular outflows down to 10^5 Mo, derive outflow rates, gas reservoir masses and depletion timescales for the entire population of local AGN. We will identify the gravitational torques driving infall, and measure inflow rates. With the continuum maps we will measure dust masses, sizes and gas/dust ratios in the nuclear disks. We will observe 22 bright AGN in 27 hours which, when added to ALMA archival observations, will provide a sample of 34 AGN (14 Seyfert 1 and 20 Seyfert 2). We will compare these with archival ALMA maps of a similarly selected sample of LINERs. The legacy value comes from combining uniform CO maps for a relatively unbiased well-studied sample of bright AGN. We will identify the most suitable bright nearby AGN for ALMA high-resolution follow-up to dynamically constrain their black hole masses.',\n"," 'The molecular gas in post-starburst galaxies. We propose to make the first spatially resolved CO imaging observations of two post-starburst E+A galaxies. These galaxies are unique because they show no signs of active star formation, but still contain large reservoirs of neutral hydrogen gas as evidenced by our own GBT and JVLA observations. Observational evidence indicates that the E+A phenomenon may, in part, mark the transitional phase between star-forming disk galaxies and quiescent spheroidal systems, and there is growing consensus that these galaxies are the result of galaxy mergers. Mapping the molecular gas in these galaxies will resolve the puzzle of why these galaxies have truncated their star formation - the molecular phase is most directly related to star formation activity. By studying the distribution and dispersion of the CO gas we can learn whether the gas is stable against the formation of dense molecular clouds. Also, the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in E+A galaxies can reveal recent gravitational interactions. Counterrotating gas, which is sometimes seen in elliptical galaxies, is a clear indication that the gas has an external origin.',\n"," 'Last equatorial flows in axial PNe, effects of a binary stellar system. Studying the appearance and properties of bipolar winds is critical for understanding the stellar evolution from the AGB to the planetary nebula (PN) phase. Many uncertainties exist regarding the presence and role of binary stellar systems. M 2-9 is a young PN with very elongated bipolar structure, that singularly yields direct information on its central stellar system. In the equator, rings detected in molecular line emission show unprecedented positional and dynamical imprints of the presence of a binary system. From those, a mass ~< 0.2 Msun was proposed for the companion of the central post-AGB star. If the presence of such low-mass companions can trigger the shaping of very elongated lobes, this would strongly supports the binary-based models. Here we propose to observe 12CO J=3-2 and 6-5 line emission to dig more deeply into the peculiar kinematics identified in the equatorial rings in M 2-9, and thus better characterize the properties of the binary system. We want to study in detail the excitation conditions of these last winds, the suggested presence of shock dynamics, and of inner warmer components, and the relation between the bipolar outflows and the equatorial rings.',\n"," 'Blowing in the Wind: Temporal Variability of Titans High-Altitude Circulation System. ALMA observations of Titan in 2016 and 2017 revealed the presence of a surprisingly fast, strongly time-variable zonal wind/jet encircling the equator at high (thermospheric) altitudes. This unexpected discovery presents a major challenge for our understanding of how momentum is transported throughout the atmospheres of terrestrial-like planets. Here we propose multi-epoch, high resolution Doppler wind measurements of HNC, HC3N, CH3CN and C2H5CN in Titans mid-to-upper atmosphere, to provide maps of the wind velocity field in four dimensions (latitude, longitude, altitude and time). This data will allow us to (1) determine the intrinsic cadence (and magnitude) of temporal variability in Titans zonal winds, (2) investigate the origin, evolution, and stability of the newly-discovered thermospheric jet, and (3) by comparison with new and state-of-the art climate models, determine the detailed mechanisms responsible for high-altitude energy and momentum transport, and their impact on the observed wind speeds. This work will to pave the way towards a new understanding of seasonal variations in the dynamics of rapidly rotating, terrestrial-like planetary atmospheres.',\n"," 'On the origin of [CII] in the Epoch of Reionization. One of the most controversial results on the study of distant (z>6.5) galaxies is the number of faint [CII] detections (including many non-detections) with ALMA. These findings indicate very diverse ISM conditions in primordial galaxies. Here, we propose to gain insight into the ISM state of the [CII]-emitting gas in a `normal (SFR~20 Msol/yr) star-forming galaxy at z=6.8 with a bright [CII] detection, using Band 5 observations to measure [NII]205mum. We will derive constraints on the L_[CII]/L_[NII] luminosity ratio, which will reveal if the fine-structure line emission in this galaxy is HII or PDR dominated. We aim to provide insight into the so-called `[CII] deficit in galaxies during the Reionization era by unveiling the ISM conditions that give rise to bright [CII] emission in this galaxy in the same epoch.',\n"," 'H3O+: Are the clouds in the central 50 pc of NGC 253 exposed to the X-rays from a black hole?. We propose to use ALMA to image the ortho-H3O+ transition at 396 GHz with a resolution of a few pc toward the starburst galaxy NGC253. This is the only submm line of H3O+ which is not affected by dust radiation pumping and will therefore be an excellent tracer of density. In contrast with the other submm lines that can be excited excited at low densities by dust emission, the 396 line will trace the high temperature, high density clouds with high ionization fraction in the nucleus of NGC253. The combination of the 396 GHz line images with those already obtained with ALMA of the para-H3O+ line at 364 GHz will provide the densities over a wide range (from few 10^3 cm-3 to 10^7 cm-3) and reliable H3O+ abundance of the clouds in NGC253. The spatial distribution of H3O+, its abundance and the densities will be used to establish the local origin (UV, X-rays and/or cosmic rays) of the enhanced ionization rates. In particular, we will explore the possibility that clouds within 50 pc of the center of NGC253 show the enhanced H3O+ abundance expected if they were affected by the X-rays from an intermediate mass black hole as suggested by the observed X-ray emission with Chandra.',\n"," 'Towards a complete sample of z~7 dusty starbursts. Using data coming from the ongoing S2COSMOS survey (a deep SCUBA2 map of the COSMOS field at 850um) we have uncovered a population of 28 Extremely Red Starbursts (ERS) with very red SCUBA2-to-SPIRE colors that suggest redshifts z > 6. This allows us to study the very-high-redshift tail of the SMG population with a statistically useful sample for the first time (only one dusty starburst has been confirmed to be at z > 6 up to date, HFLS3 at z = 6.34). We propose to carry out continuum observations in B8 and B6 to confirm the red FIR/submm colors of our ERS, pinpoint the positions of the sources, obtain FIR photometric redshifts, derive the number density of z>6 dusty starbursts and feed galaxy formation and evolution models, which generally predict that this population must have tremendously decreased at z > 4.',\n"," 'The emergent low-mass cluster B59: how to beat magnetic fields. B59 is the only star-forming site in the quiescent and magnetized Pipe nebula. It contains a small cluster of low-mass protostars and a very twisted magnetic field in comparison with the more pristine regions of the cloud. We propose to perform a detailed dynamical study of B59 using linear polarization observations. These data will reveal the magnetic field morphology in sources in B59 wich are at distinct evolutionary stages: Class 0, I and II. We want to trace the evolution of the magnetic field properties in the three stages. We expect to resolve the field morphology at the dust envelope of Class 0 objects and at the circumstellar disks at Class I and II objects. Since all targets belong to the same (low-turbulent) parental cloud, we will be able to test predictions of magnetized molecular cloud models. As a complement, molecular line data will trace the kinematics of the cores in order to better constrain the possible ambiguity of projection effects in the polarization data.',\n"," 'Can the passage of a radio jet compress the molecular gas in a galaxy?. Gas compression is a requirement for jet-induced star formation. We aim to test whether the passage of a radio jet leads to the compression of the molecular gas it encounters in an ideal target: the nearby elliptical IC5063, in which a jet propagates through a disk. Using ultra-deep SINFONI observations, we demonstrated that the jet unambiguously accelerates atomic & molecular gas along and perpendicularly to its trail. The gas velocities exceed ordered motions by 600-1200 km/s near four different bending points of the jet. The entrained/scattered gas extends far, sweeping the galaxys inner square kpc. Having a map of the outflowing molecular gas at high temperatures from SINFONI, we now aim to create a map of the outflowing molecular gas at high densities from ALMA, in order to identify regions of high pressure. In these regions, we will investigate whether the ISM is more or less prone to star formation. We request CO(1-0),(3-2), and (4-3) observations to run CO excitation models and obtain a density map. To directly probe the high-density regime and constrain the models, we request HCN, HNC, HCO+(1-0) and HCO+(4-3) observations.',\n"," 'Dissecting starbursts at z=3.6 through multi-line H2O imaging. Submm multi-line H2O studies provide a unique probe of the densest starburst regions of ULIRGs where they measure the local IR radiation field. Strong gravitational lensing boosts ALMA sensitivity and angular resolution, enabling comprehensive studies of these sources with H2O lines at z~4. The impact of such multi-line H2O observations much benefits from combination with simultaneous high\\xadresolution imaging of the far-IR dust emission and CO lines, as shown in the SV observation of the prototypal source SDP81. Our IRAM/PdBI detection of H2O in 16 high\\xadz lensed galaxies has shown that strong H2O emission is ubiquitous in high-z ULIRGs. As in local ones, our modeling shows that it originates from highly obscured IR\\xadluminous regions. We have selected the best source with high-excitation H2O emission at z=3.63 for a new step of our ALMA high\\xadz H2O project. We will observe 5 H2O lines providing the full diagnostic power of H2O, in 3 tunings in standard ALMA modes. Mapping the FIR continuum and CO(6-5) at 0.25\" will provide details of the source structure at 500pc resolution in the source plane, relating H2O emission and excitation to the overall structure and dynamics of the gas disk.',\n"," 'Multi-phase outflows in ULIRGs: Mapping the massive cold component. Using H2 2.12micron integral-field spectroscopy (IFS), we have recently characterized the hot molecular component of massive outflows in local IR bright starbursts. In particular, high velocity (~1000 km/s, FWZI) hot molecular outflows extended over 2-3 kpc regions have been identified in three low-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Based on our previous works (Emonts+14, García-Burillo+15), we predict total cold molecular outflowing masses of ~10^8 Msun and outflow rates of 15-200 Msun/yr. Here we propose to obtain deep 0.35\" CO(2-1) images of these three ULIRGs to: (i) map the massive cold molecular phase of the outflows; (ii) establish the mass loading and momentum boost factors; (iii) and, for the first time, determine the multi-phase (cold/hot molecular and ionized) sub-kpc structure of the outflows in the most extreme local star-forming galaxies.',\n"," 'Resolving water emission and dust temperature in the early universe. We propose spatially resolve dust temperature and infrared luminosity in three strongly-lensed starforming galaxies at z~3 from the SPT survey. With the aid of gravitational lensing, we will achieve kpc spatial resolution in the source plane in B9 with 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution. The B9 continuum observations will enable us to spatially resolve the L_H2O/L_IR correlation and dust temperature in galaxies at high redshift for the first time. These observations will provide a powerful constraint on the kinematics of the FIR field and help understand the relation between star formation and star formation potential at high redshift. The water observations have already been conducted in Cy 3 & 4 and the result has been published in ApJ. Here we are requesting 49 minutes in Band 9 to complete the continuum imaging portion of the project. (This exact proposal was given an A-ranking in Cycle 5, but never observed.)',\n"," 'Do z~2 quasar-driven outflows really suppress star formation?. Despite two decades of model predictions that the most luminous AGN (i.e., quasars) can have a significant impact upon the star formation in their host galaxies, the observational results that directly confirm these claims are limited and are usually very speculative. However, ``direct\" evidence for star formation suppression have been presented using IFU data for three z~2 quasars. In all three objects, these data show an anti-correlation between high velocity ionised outflows and the unobscured star formation, as traced by [O III] and narrow H-alpha emission respectively. However, our recent work combining high-resolution ALMA continuum emission, tracing obscured star formation, with tracers of unobscured star formation (such as H-alpha) has highlighted the dangers of interpretations on the total star formation in the absence of obscured star formation constraints. Here we propose an observational test to the often-cited claims of star-formation suppression, by obtaining deep 870um ~0.3\" resolution continuum maps to trace the obscured star formation in these three quasars.',\n"," 'First Detection of a Prebiotic Molecule in a Protoplanetary Disk. Complex organic molecules (COMs) are seen throughout the solar system and the ISM. However, the number of COMs detected in protoplanetary disks, the sites of planet formation, remains small. This is because the typical protoplanetary disk is too cold for most COMs to exist in the gas phase. Yet chemical models predict dust grains in disks to be active sites of COM ice chemistry. Heating events, such as those in FUor objects, can increase the disk temperature, sublimating COMs. Recently, ALMA detected five COMs in the disk of the FUor object V883 Ori. Here, we propose to use ALMA in spectral scanning mode to detect glycolaldehyde (CH2OHCHO) in V883 Ori. Glycolaldehyde is a prebiotic molecule, a precursor to sugars and, under Earth-like conditions, RNA. Glycolaldehyde was easilty detected as part of the PILS survey of the IRAS 16293 protostellar envelope and should be similarly bright in the V883 Ori disk. This program will achieve the first detection of a prebiotic molecule in a protoplanetary disk, providing observational constraints on complex chemsitry in planet forming disks.',\n"," 'The physical conditions and spatial structure of the dust formation zone of IRC+10216. We propose to study the innermost zone (1-20 R*) of IRC+10216 through the systematic observation of a significant number of vibrationally excited lines of abundant species such as HCN, HNC, SiO, SiS, SiC2 and CS. The highest angular resolution of ALMA band 6 (0.02\") is requested to resolve the stellar photosphere and the region of a few stellar radii where dust molecular seeds are formed, and where shocks could be controlling the chemistry and the dynamics of the envelope. The physical conditions across the dust formation and growth zone (1-20 R*) will be fully characterized using lines from vibrationally excited states up to 15000 K in energy. We expect to obtain a unique data set from which the physical conditions and spatial structure of the gas across these inner regions will be derived. In addition, we will trace the presence of shocks, and unveil the recent mass loss history of this prototypical C-rich AGB star. These observations will also provide strong guidelines for astrochemical models, and laboratory experiments on the properties of stardust analogues.',\n"," 'The Evolution of Molecular Outgassing in Distant Comet C/2017 K2: A Joint ALMA/JWST Monitoring Campaign Across Ice Lines. We propose ALMA Cycle 8 observations of the distantly active Oort cloud comet C/2017 K2. These observations will provide crucial information regarding molecular abundances and outgassing in support of approved JWST Cycle 1 and planned JWST Cycle 2 observations targeting K2. The overall scientific goal is to observe K2 at multiple heliocentric distances (rH) both pre- and post-perihelion, following K2 to the distant reaches of the solar system. These measurements will trace the evolution of molecular activity as K2 crosses the ice lines - the rH at which sublimation of each volatile species activates (6-8 au for CO, 2-3 au for H2O). Our objectives are to quantify the abundances and spatial distributions of CO, H2CO, CH3OH, CS, HCN, and HNC over a range of rH, including before and after the coma is dominated by H2O production. These data will enable a transformative and detailed investigation of the evolution of cometary activity as a function of primary driver (H2O or CO), providing a comprehensive record of the progression of activity from the outer to the inner solar system and yielding fundamental insights into coma dynamics and activity across a perihelion passage.',\n"," 'Characterizing Ios atmospheric composition and circulation v3. Jupiters moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system and has a very thin and spatially variable atmosphere, mainly composed of SO2. The goal of this proposal is to adress several aspects of the atmosphere that are not well characterized : the nature and abundance of the minor species, the replenishment sources for SO and SO2, and the atmospheric circulation (wind). To bring unprecedented constraints on these questions, we propose to observe a rich portion of band 7 with the extended configuration and a fine spectral resolution. The excellent available sensitivity will allow to search for expected yet undetected volcanic species such as KCl, S2O, SiO and CO, for which the abundance measurement will put strong constraints on the volcanic regimes. Simultaneously, the strong lines of main species SO2 and SO will be mapped with an improved spatial resolution, with the objective to relate their spatial distribution to their possible respective replenishment mechanisms. Finally, we will measure Doppler-shifts on the strongest line to retrieve the best observation of the atmospheric wind-field. Ios atmosphere circulation has only been observed once so far, and the proposed ALMA observations are expected to provide a radical improvement on the wind measurement.',\n"," 'Magnetic field in the vicinity of central black holes in 3C273 and 3C279. Multifrequency VLBI polarimetry is the best tool to probe the strength and structure of the magnetic field in the inner jets and in the extreme vicinity of supermassive black holes. We propose here to use the GMVA+ALMA observations of 3C273 and 3C279 in combination with our planned RadioAstron observations at 22 GHz in order to obtain the most detailed picture of polarized emission distribution and Faraday rotation measure in these objects on scales down to 20-30 microarcseconds. The phased ALMA will be crucial for improving the r.m.s. noise and structural sensitivity of the 86 GHz images, which will enable probing the rotation measure in regions with much weaker polarization signal and much steeper spectral index. Combined with the information on jet spectrum, opacity, and collimation, the polarization and rotation measure imaging will enable reconstructing the three-dimensional distribution of the magnetic field and making a founded judgement on its origin and the exact role in formation and acceleration of relativistic flows in AGN.',\n"," 'Monitoring Post-Flare Protoplanetary Chemistry with ALMA. High energy radiation from young pre-main sequence stars is one of the main drivers of the physical and chemical evolution of planet-forming disks. Traditionally, stellar radiation is assumed to be relatively constant over the course of millions of years, but in reality, young stars are incredibly dynamic. For example, X-ray flares can increase the ionization within the circumstellar disk by several orders of magnitude. Flares may play an important role in determining the long-term composition of planet-forming regions, but the direct effect of an X-ray flare influencing chemistry in real time has not yet been detected. This proposal aims to do just that. This Target of Opportunity will be triggered by Chandra observations of the Orion Molecular Cloud, where we will measure flare driven enhancement and decay of HCO+ isotopologues in four protoplanetary disks. Disks will be selected based on flare strength, known millimeter emission, and visual extinction. This set of observations will directly measure electron recombination timescales, and therefore the ionization and electron abundances, in a protoplanetary disk.',\n"," 'The [CII] Line Study of a Star-forming Galaxy in the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization. Detecting galaxies from the local to the highest redshift Universe, including the epoch of cosmic reionization at z > 6, and characterizing their star formation activity and physical properties are obviously a key issue to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies as well as disentangle the relationship between the diverse populations of galaxies. While star formation and dynamics of low-z galaxies have been well studied using the CO lines as a tracer, those of high-z galaxies have not due to its faintness.Meanwhile, the ionized carbon 158 micron [CII]line can be a powerful alternative to detect high-z galaxies, because it is the strongest cooling line of ISM in galaxies and observable at submm/mm when redshifted to z >6. The ALMA can detect high-z [CII]line only in a few hours and resolve galaxies in this line emission on a few kpc scales, enabling to probe obscured star formation and constrain the sizes, the dynamical masses and ISM in early star-forming galaxies at the epoch of reionization for the first time.Here, we propose the ALMA [CII]line observation of a star-forming galaxy at z >6. We particularly propose to target a z = 6.96 galaxy IOK-1, because it is one of the spectroscopically confirmed highest-class redshift objects in the epoch of reionization and we have a lot of information about this galaxy that can be compared with the ALMA observation. Using IOK-1 as a probe, we will (1) reveal the relation between high-z and local star-forming galaxies, (2) estimate obscured SFR at z~7, (3) investigate the morphology, dynamics and physical properties of a z~7 galaxy, (4) to constrain the physical states of ISM in a z~7 galaxy.',\n"," 'ALMA Study of the Hyperluminous SMGs Identified from Planck All-Sky Survey. We have identified 31 hyperluminous SMGs with apparent IR luminosity of ~10^14 solar luminosity by selecting candidate high-z sources from the Planck Catalog of Compact Sources and by examining their characteristic dust SED and multi-wavelength photometric properties. They are verified to be high-z sources by detecting 1mm dust continuum and one or more CO lines using the Large Millimeter Telescope. Our ongoing HST/WFC3 imaging program has shown that the majority are strongly lensed SMGs by a foreground massive galaxy or galaxy cluster. Here, we propose to image 16 Planck SMGs using ALMA in the same CO transitions and 1mm continuum detected by the LMT in order: (1) to confirm the AzTEC & RSR detections and to map the location, spatial extent, and kinematics of gas (CO) and and to analyze their relation to SF (1mm continuum) activity and stellar light traced by our HST/WFC3 imaging; (2) to derive the magnification factor and in turn the intrinsic luminosity and masses; and (3) to identify the best candidates for future high resolution, high sensitivity study that will lead to an in-depth exploration of SF and gas physics at 10 to 100 pc scales via gravitational lens modeling.',\n"," 'Observations of the [CII] Emission Line in Hot-Dust Obscured Galaxies. The WISE mission has recently identified a rare population of high-redshift, hyper-luminous infrared galaxies, all with bolometric luminosities above 10^13 L_Sun, and many exceeding 10^14 L_Sun. Characterized by their extremely red mid-IR colors and very hot dust temperatures, these hot, dust obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) likely probe a key stage in the galaxy evolution paradigm. The bulk of the IR emission in Hot DOGs is powered by AGN activity, outshining possible fainter cold emission associated to star formation. The only way to study the ISM properties of the host galaxy in these objects, as well as the effects of the AGN on it, are through kpc-scale imaging of the dust and gas at sub-mm wavelengths. We propose here to use ALMA to obtain deep, high-resolution observations of the 157.7um [CII] emission line and of the FIR continuum in a small sample of carefully selected Hot DOGs to constrain the physical properties of the their dust and gas components and gain insights into their star-formation properties.',\n"," 'Evolution of ISM in Star-Forming Galaxies at z = 1 - 5. We propose to measure the ISM contents of 180 galaxies at z ~ 1.15, 2.2 and 4.8 -- sampling both the normal star-forming galaxy main sequence and the starburst population with IR luminosities elevated up to 20 above the main sequence. The sample is stellar mass selected at 0.3-4x10^11 solar masses. The ISM masses will be determined from ALMA Band 7 & 6 continuum observations which measure the long wavelength, optically thin dust emission -- this technique has major advantages compared to CO line measures: avoidance of the CO conversion factor issues (i.e. dependence on excitation conditions -- temperature, density and metallicity) and much greater speed (approximately 10 times faster to the same mass limit). With these ISM masses for statistically meaningful samples, we can determine the gas mass fractions as a function of redshift and stellar mass and also investigate the elevated star formation activity above the main sequence. Is the enhanced activity due to larger ISM masses or enhanced efficiency for conversion of gas to stars?',\n"," 'Sodium Shadows - a new tracer of the coldest gas in cluster cores. The cores of clusters of galaxies are complex environments with both very hot, dense gas and very cold molecular gas that has cooled out from the hot component. Optical emission-line filaments are found in almost all cluster cores where strong cooling is observed in the X-ray. In the past 15 years we have established that cold molecular gas is threaded through this ionised material, and ALMA has shown that the two phases are intricately linked. Recently, however, we have used VLT/MUSE spectroscopy to identify a cold gas filament which is only visible through its narrow NaD absorption lines, projected against the BCG starlight of the low-redshift cluster A3716. Optical line emission is barely detectable even with the high sensitivity of MUSE, perhaps indicating a very low temperature in the cloud. Here, we propose ALMA observations to determine whether there is molecular gas associated with the A3716 \"Sodium Shadow\", and whether the cold gas extends behind the BCG where NaD absorption cannot be observed. The possibility that molecular gas may be present in cluster cores that we have overlooked by relying on optical emission line selection would have far-reaching implications.',\n"," 'Why is star formation boosted from the inside out in low z starburst galaxies?. High spatial resolution maps of stars and gas in nearby galaxies provide vital insight into how stars are form on kpc (and below) scales. Such local studies, such as HERACLES, PAWS and EMPIRE, have shown that star formation depends sensitively on environment, as well as the raw gas reservoir available as fuel. However, these local samples are limited by statistics, and hence do not sample galaxies at the extremes of star formation. We propose to study the interplay between gas and star formation in a sample of low-z starbursts, selected from the MaNGA IFU survey. Although rare in the low redshift universe, local starbursts represent analogs to star formation at high-z, where galaxies were more gas-rich and formed stars at much higher rates than obseved today. We have recently shown (Ellison et al. 2018) that these low-z starbursts are centrally concentrated, building stellar mass from the inside-out. By combining the kpc-scale MaNGA SFR maps with CO maps obtained on the same spatial scale, we will distinguish whether the central starbursts occur due to a simple abundance of molecular gas, or whether they additionally exhibit elevated star formation efficiencies.',\n"," 'Redshifts of bright Herschel ATLAS gravitational lenses. We propose CO redshift measurements of 30 of the brightest (S500m > 0.1 Jy) strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies from the equatorial and Southern fields of the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H\\xadATLAS). These simple observations will double the sample size of H-ATLAS background source redshifts, complementing our long-term 8m-class foreground lens redshift campaigns. Our pioneering lens selection (Negrello et al. 2010 Science) has an astonishing ~100% efficiency and the gravitational amplification makes CO line detection up to ~100× faster than in unlensed surveys. Our proposed redshifts will provide spectroscopic confirmation of gravitational lensing, by finding submm redshifts that are clearly higher than the redshifts of the lensing masses. This on its own is already enough to make statistical constraints on the dark matter halo profiles. Combined with our ongoing multi-wavelength campaigns, we will start placing direct constraints on the evolving dark matter distribution of the lenses. The joint lens\\xadsource redshift distribution is a key discriminator of cosmological parameters and the evolution of dark matter haloes.',\n"," 'How common are extreme molecular haloes around z~2 quasars?. Cicone et al. (2021) reported the discovery of a giant CO(3-2)-line emitting halo extending out to r~200 kpc from a quasar at z~2 selected to have known kpc scale outflow. Such halo was resolved out by ALMA and could only be revealed through fairly deep ACA observations. This molecular circumgalactic medium reservoir may embed a massive amount of molecular gas, and it does not appear to be associated with an overdensity of optical, infrared or sub-millimeter emitters around the quasar. We propose to expand the relevance of this discovery for the field of galaxy formation and evolution by extending the search for massive >100kpc-size CO haloes in additional five z~2 AGN, hosting a wide range of kpc scale outflow properties, using similar deep ACA CO(3-2) observations. The goals of this pilot study are: 1) a first assessment of how common these massive H2 haloes are at z~2; 2) understand the relevance of AGN outflows in the formation of this cold phase of the CGM.',\n"," 'Understanding the role of infrared radiative pumping in ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We propose to obtain the molecular line data of (1) HCN/HCO+/HNC J=2-1, (2) vibrationally excited (v2=1f) J=2-1 and J=8-7 of HCN/HCO+/HNC, and (3) their isotopologue H13CN/H13CO+/HN13C, of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), IRAS 20551-4250. This ULIRG contains a luminous obscured AGN and shows clearly detectable v2=1f J=3-2 and J=4-3 emission lines of HCN and HNC in our previously taken ALMA data, thanks to small observed molecular line widths. Thus, this ULIRG is an excellent laboratory to estimate how the infrared radiative pumping mechanism affects the observed HCN/HCO+/HNC rotational J-transition fluxes, in addition to the widely assumed collisional excitation. By combining with our previously taken ALMA data for this ULIRG, we will first constrain molecular gas physical properties, and then evaluate how the infrared radiative pumping contributes. Our comprehensive (sub)millimeter molecular line data set of IRAS 20551-4250 will be an invaluable basis to understand the physical origin of the observed (sub)millimeter molecular line flux ratios in AGN-containing ULIRGs from the local to distant universe, whose ALMA observations will routinely be made in the near future.',\n"," 'Hunting for redshifts of faint DSFGs in A2744. We propose an ALMA linescan for 7 secure DSFGs detected in our 1.1 mm cycle 2 ALMA images of Frontier Field cluster A2744. These modestly lensed (u~1.5-4) DSFGs likely lie at z~1-4 and span intrinsic luminosities of log[L(IR)]~11.5-12.3, thus probing a region of phase space that is currently poorly sampled at high redshift. However, their extremely red NIR colors and magnitudes make spectroscopic redshift detection impossible with current instrumentation. These ALMA observations will circumvent the current bottleneck to secure redshifts for all of the targets, allowing firm individual constraints (e.g., SFRs; stellar, dust and molecular masses via SED modeling; excitation ladders; gas depletion times) as well as to characterize and compare the population to previously studied brighter DSFGs and MS galaxies. The requested pointings will also serve to confirm and similarly constrain lower significance sources, detect new fainter line and continuum sources, place useful individual and stacking limits on many field galaxies (a substantial fraction with firm VIMOS, MUSE, and KMOS redshifts).',\n"," 'Testing feedback scenarios and clump life times in a prototypical z~2 galaxy. Theoretical models predict that key aspects of galaxy evolution including bulge formation, black hole accreation and quenching may be regulated by the dynamics of large star forming clumps which are almost ubiquitous in the gas rich ISM medium of normal high redshift galaxies. The effective relevance of this scenario depends on the longevity and the possibility of \"rejuvenation\" of such instabilities, both of which can be observationally constrained by probing the amount and distribution of cold gas at the clump scales. We thus propose for ~8h high resolution mapping of molecular gas content in HUDF 6462, a well studied and typical star forming z~1.5 clumpy galaxy. We target the CO(5-4) emission line in Band 6 using a 0.4\" beam width for resolving individual clumps. The requested frequency range covers the rest-frame 500micron thus also offering the possibility of measuring continuum dust emission. These new ALMA data, combined with the state of the art data set available for the proposed target, will offer strong constraints on the above key questions.',\n"," 'A new, fast, ultradeep constraint on the ISM content of the first generations of massive quiescent galaxies.. The question of whether quenching requires complete gas depletion does not have a clear answer yet. The literature offers contrasting results, whose intepretation requires large statistical samples that are not yet available. We propose to take advantage of a new, compelling method to measure the total gas fraction of high-z quiescent galaxies by using the brightest molecular gas mass tracer, i.e. the [CII] 158 microns fine-structure emission line. This line has long been overlooked since it is predominantly used for star-forming galaxies. However, it becomes particularly useful for quiescent galaxies at high-z since these are often selected to have suppressed sSFRs - but not absent - with respect to main sequence galaxies. By exploting ALMA bands 8-9-10 we will observe gas fractions down to 1% (without strictly requiring strong lensing) in 8 spectroscopically confirmed, well-studied, massive quiescent galaxies at 1.22.9.',\n"," 'Deuteration in galaxies: Breaking ground with ALMA. Since the detection of unexpectedly high deuterium fractionation in the Galactic Center almost 20 years ago, many follow up observations were carried out in different Galactic environments which showed deuterium abundances well above the elemental ratio D/H~1.5x10^-5. These observations have been well reproduced by chemical models and showed that deuteration may be an excellent tracer of the degree of chemical processing of the gas by star formation, and therefore a tracer of pristine material feeding the future star formation events. Though models have been proposed for different extragalactic environments, only now, with the superb sensitivity of ALMA, observations are possible. We thus propose to measure for the first time the D/H ratio in the starburst ISM of NGC 253. We aim at simultaneously observe DCN, DCO+ and N2D+, as well as a second observation to target the 13C substitutions of HCN, HCO+ as well as N2H+.',\n"," 'The systematic search for a causal connection between AGN-driven outflows and star formation. Leading models of galaxy formation require kpc-scale AGN-driven outflows to terminate star formation (SF). Observationally there is good evidence for outflows in many AGN but we lack clear evidence for a causal connection between outflows and SF. We recently completed our 25n VLT-KMOS program of distant AGN to undertake a systematic study of AGN-driven outflows and their impact on SF. We have constraints on the key outflow properties (outflow sizes, energetics, rates) but lack the sensitive SF measurements to test the outflow-SF connection. We propose for sensitive ALMA continuum observations of 63 AGN at z=1.1-2.4 (out of a sample of 103 with high-quality outflow constraints) that lack sensitive SF measurements. Our proposed observations will probe SF rates up to an order of magnitude below the mean for X-ray AGN at these redshifts, allowing us to identify even suppressed SF. With the proposed observations we will measure the distributions of SF as a function of outflow property (e.g., emission-line width; spatial extent; outflow energetics; AGN radio power) to systematically search for the \"smoking gun\" evidence for a causal connection between AGN-driven outflows and SF.',\n"," 'Interplay between the Orion A South (OMC-4) filament and dense cores therein. We propose to map the quiescent filament in Orion A South (OMC-4) with 3-mm and 1-mm continuum as well as the dense molecular tracers including N2H+, HNC and HC3N, aiming to reveal the detailed structures and kinematic features of the V-shaped filament of OMC-4, to resolve the dense clumps therein into individual cores of Jeans Scale, and to determine the dynamical properties and the instabilities status of the cores. Eventually, these results would help to understanding several fundamental properties and characters of the filament structures and there roles in mass aggregation and initiating the star formation.',\n"," 'What is the origin of spiral arms in the disk of HD 142527?. In Cycle 0, we discovered CO spiral arms extending out to 500 au in the outer disk of HD 142527. Surprisingly these spirals are very faint in CO (3-2), but brighter in CO (2-1), with temperatures as low as 10 to 15 K. We propose to confirm such low temperatures in HD 142527, and put deep limits on the continuum so as to test for low dust-to-gas mass ratios, that may explain the detection of CO gas colder than the freeze-out temperature (18 K). The new measured dynamics of the gas in the spirals will allow us to put conclusive constraints on their origin. In particular, the new observations of the spirals will also be confronted to our novel hypothesis of spirals launched by the shadows cast by the inclined inner disk.',\n"," '1 kpc Imaging of z~6 Quasar Host Galaxies. Recent ALMA [CII] and dust imaging of a sample of z>6 quasar host galaxies at high spatial resolution (~0.25\", ~2kpc at z~6) reveal a surprising range of morphologies and kinematics. The distribution of gas around these accreting ~10^9 M_sun black holes encodes critical information on the assembly history of these early massive structures that is otherwise inaccessible. Capitalizing on previous low-resolution ALMA observations we request 1 kpc resolution (~0.15\") [CII] and dust continuum imaging of a [CII] flux-limited sample of z>6 quasars. This unparalleled dataset will differentiate between dispersion-dominated compact vs. rotation-dominated extended vs. tidally disturbed [CII] emission, and will pin-down the frequency of merging events in z>6 quasar hosts. They will also provide spatially resolved star formation and gas surface densities and address if the hosts form stars at the Eddington limit. Together with the derived dynamical masses of the hosts (needed to constrain the M_BH/M_dyn ratios) the observations will provide crucial constraints to simulations of the first massive galaxies in the Universe.',\n"," 'WISDOM: Constraining the scatter in the M-sigma relation at fixed velocity dispersion. SMBH masses correlate most tightly with the stellar velocity dispersion of their hosts, but whether the same relation holds for early- and late-type galaxies remains an open question. Various works suggest that massive LTGs follow an M-sigma relation with a similar slope, but lower normalisation than ETGs. This lower SMBH mass at fixed sigma is typically regarded as evidence for the role of SMBH accretion in quenching. However, making strong conclusions is hindered by systematic differences in the techniques used to measure SMBH masses in these different objects. Molecular gas SMBH measurements are the ideal tool to remove this uncertainty. We here propose to begin to answer this question in a targeted manner, using ACA observations for a sample of galaxies in a narrow velocity dispersion range to map the molecular gas in these systems and ascertain whether these are suitable for high-resolution follow up. Given the small uncertainties, with a sample of molecular SMBH masses measurements for 10 ETG and 10 LTG in this range we can robustly measure the offsets relative to the M-sigma relation, and determine whether early and late type galaxies truly follow the same scaling relations.',\n"," 'A direct test of the magnetar-model in Superluminous Supernovae. Stripped-envelope Superluminous Supernovae (SLSN-I) are stellar explosions with optical luminosities ~10-100 times that of supernovae (SNe). An extra energy source is required to account for the extreme luminosity, and recent studies favour the model where this is provided by the spin-down of a rapidly-rotating, strongly-magnetized neutron star (magnetar) formed in the SNe. Importantly, this magnetar-engine model could account for the diverse properties across all classes of stripped-envelope SNe. Additionally, Fast Radio Bursts are attributed to pulsars/magnetars in many leading models and might be created in this way. Given the wide-ranging implications of the model, it is vital that we establish if it is valid. We propose to do the first key test to conclusively determine if SLSNe-I are powered by a magnetar central engine. With 4.76 hours of Band 3 and 6 observations of the closest SLSN-I discovered to date (SN2017egm), we will obtain the deepest sub-mm observations of a SLSN-I and search for the sub-mm magnetar signature. With these observations we will either make the first direct detection of a magnetar central engine or rule out the magnetar-engine model.',\n"," 'Sulphur in protoplanetary disks - a zero-sum game. Sulphur plays an important role in the ionization balance in protoplanetary disks and affects planetesimal differentiation, underlining the need to accurately model the chemical evolution of this element from the protostellar to the planetary stage. The sulphur budget in protoplanetary disks is currently poorly known, observations suggest >90% of volatile sulphur is missing from the gas. Chemical models suggest the main volatile S carriers are CS, SO, SO2, and H2S, but in cold disks their gas-phase abundances may be affected by freezeout. We have recently shown how the photospheric abundances of young A-stars trace the composition of their inner disks. For one such star, HD 100546, the S abundance is consistent with all volatile sulphur accreting as gas through the dust-depleted inner disk cavity. We will use ALMA to obtain a spatially resolved census of the main (and a number of secondary) sulphur-bearing molecules in the disk. Comparison of their summed abundances with the stellar S/H ratio will reveal whether there is a need to invoke new volatile sulphur reservoirs, such as a large abundance of sulphur chains.',\n"," 'Resolving the molecular gas within 100 pc of M87s supermassive black hole. The proximity of M87 (3C 274), the archetypical giant elliptical radio galaxy at the centre of the Virgo galaxy cluster, presents a unique opportunity to investigate in detail the circumnuclear molecular gas revealed first by CO J=1-0 observations with the IRAM 30-m and more recently imaged for the first time with ALMA (this teams Cycle 1 data). The preliminary results from the ALMA data show that the molecular gas is unresolved and resides within 100~pc of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). With this Cycle 3 proposal we wish to obtain 0.12 (~10~pc) imaging of the CO J=1-0 line to unambiguously resolve the molecular gas structures for the first time, allowing us to investigate the nature and origin of molecular gas that resides within the 3.1 sphere of influence (SOI) of the SMBH in unprecedented detail. Such observations are only now possible with ALMAs long baseline capability.',\n"," 'The fall and rise of Betelgeuse: diving in its ejecta with ACA. Some weeks ago the recent dimming of the nearby RSG Betelgeuse caused a cascade of public news, following the suggestion by some that core-collapse may be imminent. Another hypothesis is that the visual dimming is caused by an increased extinction along the line of sight due to an enhanced dust mass-loss episode, consistent with the erratic stellar activity of evolved massive stars. We propose a monitoring programme with ACA in Bands 3 and 6 with a cadence of 15 days, to establish whether the recent visual variability is due to dust and to perform an unprecedented study of the dust properties and formation cycle. We request calibration-limited observations (with photometric uncertainty of 5%) to derive: 1) light curves for each sideband, to analyse and compare their periods and any possible phase lag due to dust life cycle; 2) internal spectral index per band, to study changes of dust opacity. We also request one epoch in Band 7 to evaluate the contribution of molecular line emission on complementary JCMT/SCUBA2 monitoring observations that were recently started. With these observations we will gain an unique insight into dust processes and mass-loss in massive stars.',\n"," 'Mapping M17: the best galactic laboratory for measuring the role of photoionizing feedback. Feedback is a central problem in astrophysics; it affects all stages and all scales of star formation. Recent numerical work has reexamined the role of ionizing feedback, showing that photoevaporation injects momentum into the cold molecular gas. In this way, ionizing feedback may (1) explain compressed layers and high pressures in PDRs; (2) carve dust pillars; and (3) resupply turbulence. High angular resolution observations of the cold gas kinematics are essential to test these predictions. Messier 17 (M17) has the highest degree of ionization of galactic star-forming regions and is unambiguously dominated by pre-supernova feedback, making it the ideal laboratory. We request an ACA mosaic of M17 to measure the cold gas kinematics as a function of position and therefore incident ionizing flux in order to measure the distribution of turbulence in the cold molecular gas. These data also allow us to (a) produce a high resolution map of the PDR, (b) detect dust pillars and protostars and measure their masses, and (c) estimate cloud destruction time. This cloud-scale survey allows us to conduct the first comprehensive study of the role of ionizing feedback in star formation.',\n"," 'Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby Galaxies: The Local Galaxy Inventory Continued. We propose to utilize the ACA (7m+TP) to map in CO(2-1) the full star forming disks of all yet-to-be-observed nearby, large-on-the-sky spiral galaxies in which the ACA resolves molecular cloud scales (50-100 pc). These data will provide the large scale picture of the molecular ISM in five nearby galaxies and enable key insight into the interplay between galactic environment and cloud-scale gas properties. These galaxies harbor a range of physical environments, from massive AGN to low mass flocculent spirals, and thus provide a crucial link between the Local Group (where high resolution permits study of sub-cloud scale physics) and the broader galaxy population (which includes a wider range of environments). With these data we will measure GMC properties and scaling relations, cloud lifetimes, and star formation efficiency as a function of the diverse environments found in these galaxies. The resolution, sensitivity, and spatial coverage match those of our ongoing Large Program to map the disks of more distant targets with the 12m array, and so these additional galaxies will both fold into and inform the larger sample while providing context for ongoing and future zoom-in studies.',\n"," 'Resolving the molecular gas and dust in a unique star forming disk galaxy z~2. We propose to obtain simultaneous high-resolution imaging of the CO 4-3 and [CI] 1-0 emission lines and dust continuum in the best characterized star-forming disk galaxy at z~2. These observations will provide a unique test on the predicted modes of gas accretion by resolving the kinematics and distribution of the molecular gas into kpc-scale regions of active star formation. This will enable an unprecendented view to the obscured star-forming regions that are hidden to the available optical/UV imaging and spectroscopy. We will be able to (1) perform accurate modeling of the galaxy kinematics (kinemetry); (2) characterize the molecular gas and star forming clumps; (3) test star formation laws (gas vs SFR surface densities) in kpc scales, and (4) use their line ratios as a proxy to the fraction of dense gas mass (versus total) to probe the gas excitation in kpc scales. In combination with the previous measurements of CO 3-2/1-0, the proposed observations will allow us to put into context the derived physical properties of the ISM (Tkin, n_H2) for a comprehensive study about the properties of this galaxy.',\n"," 'Mapping the Unique Dwarf Galaxies in the Local Group (MUDGILG). We propose to observe and fully map the CO(2-1) line in two of the most metal-poor, star-forming dwarf galaxies in the Local Group -- IC 1613 and NGC 6822. These would be the first wide-field, high-resolution CO maps of these two galaxies. With only a handful of actively star-forming dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, IC 1613 and NGC 6822 are essential targets to understand the impact of metallicity on the interstellar medium (ISM). Despite its proximity, NGC 6822 has been observed relatively little with ALMA, while IC 1613 has not been observed at all with ALMA. The high sensitivity and large field of view of the ACA will allow us to create the first ever wide-field CO maps of these galaxies, with spatial and kinematic resolution capable of identifying the structure in individual molecular clouds. The proposed observations would enable a rigorous investigation of the properties of the low-metallicity, CO-bright molecular gas in these unique galaxies and would be compared with other tracers of the ISM and star formation, particularly VLA observations of HI, H-alpha imaging to trace recent star formation, and stellar populations characterized by Hubble.',\n"," 'What is the role of molecular gas when galaxies transition from blue to red?. The processes that cause the transition of galaxies from actively starforming to quiescent objects are still poorly understood. Galaxies in Hickson Compact Groups (HCG) are ideal objects to study this topic in a dense environment. Infrared (IR) colours are very powerful to find transitioning galaxies from underpopulated regions (canyon or IR Transition Zone) in the IR color space that indicate a fast transition from star-forming to quiescent. For a sample of transitioning HCG galaxies with CO(1-0) data we found clear evidence for a drastic decrease in the the star formation efficiency (SFE) and in the molecular gas fraction from active to transitioning galaxies (Lisenfeld+2017). However, it is still unclear what causes the decrease and perturbation of the molecular gas. Interactions with neighboring galaxies, intragroup gas and shocks causing turbulence are the suspected reasons. Here, we propose to map a small sample of southern canyon/IRTZ galaxies with the lowest SFE in CO(2-1) in order to derive a detailed image of the molecular gas distribution and kinematics that will allow us to find out whether tidal processes or interaction with intragroup gas is the dominant cause.',\n"," 'Confirming a close quasar pair or a gravitationally lensed quasar at z=5.66. We propose ALMA imaging of the sub-mm continuum and the [C II] line of J2037-4537, a newly discovered apparent quasar pair at z=5.66. J2037-4537 consists of two close quasar images at exactly the same redshift, which are either a physical quasar pair or lensed images of the same quasar. In the former case, J2037-4537 will be the highest redshift quasar pair, which will place strong constraints on AGN evolution models, and will enable follow-up studies including the triggering mechanism of AGN, the small-scale structures of IGM, and the search for a protocluster. In the latter case, J2037-4537 will be only the second lensed quasar known at z>5 and will be an excellent case study for the high-z SMBH population. It is difficult to distinguish the two scenarios in optical/near-IR wavelengths. We propose ALMA imaging for this system which will be the definitive test of the two scenarios. Pair and lensing hypotheses predict distinctively different continuum and [CII] morphology as well as [CII] kinematics of the two components. The proposed observation will also further probe physical properties (SFR, gas kinematics, etc.) of this unique pair/lens system.',\n"," 'A detailed view of the Birds anatomy: the vital organs of a rare triple galaxy merger. The Bird is a luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), logL_IR(L_sun)=11.89, product of a triple merger. The ongoing star formation (SF) in the least massive of the components (the head) outshines that of the primary nuclei (the heart and the body) as evidenced by our Spitzer-24um imaging, hence dominating the LIRG phenomenon in the Bird. This clashes with the commonly accepted major merger scenario in which the SF is expected to be higher in central compact regions. The Bird has a global high SF rate of ~190Msun/yr and shows spectroscopic evidence for outflowing gas reaching v~600 km/s. The complexity of this system makes it a perfect laboratory to study star-forming regions with a wide range of physical conditions, which we can probe with the aid of sub-mm observations. For doing this, we propose to perform a detailed study of the gas (12CO 1-0, 3-2 and 6-5, 13CO 3-2) and dust continuum of the three NIR-bright components of the Bird. The proposed ALMA observations, together with our NIR, MIR and optical data, represent a unique dataset that will allow us to test the major merger scenario, whilst making the Bird a local template to be compared to IR luminous high-z galaxy mergers.',\n"," 'The Serpens-Aquilla Disk and Multiplicity Survey. We propose a survey of 170 protostars in the Serpens-Aquila star-forming region at 0.09\" (~40 au) resolution in Band 7. We will characterize the multiplicity frequency, companion separation distribution, protostellar dust disk masses, and dust disk radii for the largest sample of protostars (besides Orion) within 500 pc. The origin of disks and multiplicity are rooted in the earliest stages of star-formation, but only three sizeable regions have had their protostellar multiplicity and disks characterized (Perseus, Orion, and Ophiuchus). The previous surveys discovered a bimodal distribution of companion separations and it is important to determine if this is `universal. Similarly, disks emerge early, yet it is unclear if the protostellar disk mass and size distributions are similar across all star-forming regions. This is important given that protostellar disks (as an ensemble) are found to be 5-10x more massive than Class II disks. This survey is essential to test whether or not protostellar disks and multiplicity have similar properties across distinct star-forming regions, implying similar physical processes.',\n"," 'An ALMA/JCMT Study of the Time-Variable Class 0 Protostar HOPS 358 and Its (Warped?) Protostellar Disk. The JCMT Transient Survey recently discovered that the Class 0 protostar, HOPS 358, decreased in 350 GHz continuum brightness by 35% over a period of 40 months, with the change likely due to time-variable mass accretion. Based on the Herschel SED, HOPS 358 is thought to be among the youngest protostars in NGC 2068 and therefore an excellent candidate for studying the earliest stages of mass assembly. Fortuitously, the VANDAM: Orion Survey observed HOPS 358 at 0.1\" angular resolution with ALMA at 345 GHz before it began to fade, revealing a bright, resolved edge-on disk. For young protostars, the effective disk viscosity determines the mass accretion rate. Thus, measurement of the variations in the accretion rate and the corresponding appearance of the disk, including a potential disk warp seen in the VANDAM observations, will provide vital clues to how protostellar mass is assembled. HOPS 358 presents the first opportunity to directly study a Class 0 disk at various levels of protostellar activity and constrain the physical processes related to accretion. We thus propose to re-observe HOPS 358 with ALMA Band 7, while its brightness remains low.',\n"," 'The GLEAMing of the first supermassive balck holes in the Universe. The low-frequency radio survey, GLEAM, has opened a new window for identifying radio-loud AGN (RLAGN) during the epoch of reionisation (z > 6). To identify them, we rely on a well-proven technique allowing us to push our current sources to z 5. We select candidates from their radio steep-spectrum radio emission, a well proven technique to identify high-z RLAGN. We focus particularly our research on the GAMA-09 field, allowing to further optimise our selection, observation time and discard potential low-z sources contamination thanks to the multiwavelength information provided by the GAMA survey. We propose here to bypass the traditional framework (consisting of a succession of observations) for identification of high-z sources by using ALMA to scan B3. The discovery of even a single RLAGN at the epoch of reionisation will open up a myriad of powerful new research avenues such as probing the neutral IGM with HI absorption against the radio source but also constrain how supermassive blackholes formed at such high redshifts.',\n"," 'AGN Feedback in Action: Zooming in on the Molecular Outflow in the Nearest Active Galactic Nucleus. Galactic winds are essential to feedback processes that quench star formation and limit the total mass of large galaxies. However, they are poorly understood due to a lack of observational evidence, particularly in the molecular phase. In ALMA Cycle 2, we succsessfully detected the AGN-driven molecular wind in Circinus, constraining the molecular mass of the outflow, velocity, and general morphology. However, these observations are limited in resolution, rendering follow-up observations necessary. With 2.5 additional hours (including overheads) in Cycle 3, we will obtain a factor of 7 improvement in beam area to resolve structure on 25 pc scales - crucial to demonstrating interactions with the ISM. We will create detailed kinematic models of the wind, essential to determining whether molecular gas leaves the galaxy and if/when/where it is reaccreted to fuel future star formation.',\n"," 'High spatial resolution imaging of the inner envelope of R Sculptoris. We propose to observe the detailed structure of the spiral shape detected in Cycle 0 observations in CO line emission around the carbon AGB star R Scl. A succesfull Cycle 1 proposal (carried over to Cycle 2) was aimed at observing the circumstellar emission from R Scl at high angular resolution in CO emission in band 7. The proposal combines the most extended main-array configuration for high spatial resolution with a compact main array configuration, ACA and total power observations. The data will describe the detailed inner circumstellar morphology by measuring deviations from a perfect spiral, resolving the binary system, and accurately measuring the contrast between the winding and inter-winding regions, relying on the high angular-resolution observations. The Cycle 1 low-resolution data confirm the Cycle 0 findings. However, the extended configuration has not yet been observed. Missing the high-resolution data will limit the value of the delivered Cycle 1 observations. We therefore resubmit the observations for the extended configuration (a total observing time of approx. 1 hour). In case the data is still completed in Cycle 2, we will withdraw the Cycle 3 proposal.',\n"," 'Characterize the submm nature of host galaxies of a \"quasar-quasar\" pair at the cosmic dawn. We propose 0.5\" resolution [CII] 158um line and rest-frame far-infrared continuum observations toward a newly discovered z = 6.05 low-luminosity unlensed \"quasar-quasar\" pair (separation ~ 12 kpc) by our on-going Subaru/HSC survey. With this only ~2hr investment, we can characterize star-formation rates, global gas distribution, dynamical masses, early co-evolution, and even ~10 kpc-scale reionization geometry around the system. From our optical data, we already captured hints of close interaction of these quasars. According to hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy-mergers, such interacting galaxies will coalesce to form a heavily dust-obscured starburst and an extremely luminous quasar such as discovered by past wide-field optical surveys. Hence, this quasar-quasar pair will provide a very unique laboratory to study the formation processes (or conditions) of luminous quasars (supermassive black holes), massive galaxies, and early co-evolution, at the cosmic dawn. The properties obtained here must be beneficial for planning efficient JWST Cycle 1 and ALMA Cycle 8 programs to investigate further details of this system. (The exact coordinate will be set in Phase2)',\n"," 'Probing the molecular gas -- the missing puzzle piece to the baryon cycle. The interactions between gas and galaxies are of paramount importance to our understanding of structure formation. A fundamental element of such baryon cycle studies is a complete census of the condensed matter (stars and cold gas) in both galaxies and their immediate surroundings, the so-called circumgalactic medium. Probes of the neutral atomic gas HI, ionised gas and stellar component have been assembled for of a sample of 48 galaxies. Without a quantitative description of the molecular phase however, one cannot reach a full census of their baryons. ALMAs unrivaled mm coverage and high sensitivity is ideal to characterise the CO emission of these z~0.5 HI-selected galaxies. By measuring the molecular mass, kinematics, gas flows and gas fractions, the project will: i) determine the role of molecular gas in HI-rich galaxies, ii) decipher the molecular phase of gas flows from morpho-kinematics analyses, and iii) reach a complete census of the condensed baryons in the circumgalactic medium. These results will provide unique insights into the baryon cycle - a crucial component of galaxy formation.',\n"," 'Characterizing diffusive processes in the B335 protostar. The ionization fraction in protostellar environments is a key ingredient responsible for the efficiency of most diffusive processes allowing to diffuse the magnetic field in protostellar enevlopes, therefore modifying strongly the efficiency of magnetic braking during the main accretion phase. Recent observational and theoretical results highlight the role of magnetic braking in other long-standing problems in astronomy such as the angular momentum problem, and the formation of stellar binaries and disks. Here, we propose to simultaneously and independently characterize the magnetic topology, magnetic intensity, and diffusive processes in a young protostar, B335, using observations of molecular ions to be combined with our already obtained polarization data. We will characterize finely the coupling of the field to the circumstellar gas, and describe the efficiency of magnetic braking to drive angular momentum transport, regulate the accretion rate, and affect disk formation in this young accreting protostar.',\n"," 'Starburst-driven superwind in the nearby galaxy NGC 1808 traced by CI. Multi-line imaging of galactic superwinds is essential to determine the energetics of outflowing gas and understand how the winds regulate star formation in their host galaxies. In this study, we propose observations of atomic carbon CI (J=1-0 at 492 GHz) complemented with molecular gas tracers (mainly CO) in the central region of NGC 1808, a nearby starburst galaxy with a superwind. We aim to: 1) Measure the distribution of atomic carbon gas with respect to the molecular gas and tracers of star formation. A comparison of atomic and molecular lines at high resolution (25-50 pc) would allow us to determine the physical conditions (kinetic temperature and density) of molecular gas and reveal the structure of the photodissociation region (PDR) in the starburst environment. 2) Measure the CI flux in a resolved superwind to analyze whether CI traces the same bulk molecular gas as CO, and search for CO-dark gas in the outflow. The derived physical conditions will be used to construct a PDR model for the outflow gas. Such model can become a reference for interpreting CI and CO data at high redshift, where superwinds are considered to be a major feedback mechanism in galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Final Piece of the Puzzle: What Drives the Enhanced X-ray Emission from the Most Powerful Jets in the Early Universe. We propose ALMA observations of 15 highly radio-loud quasars at z>4 to obtain their far-infrared luminosity and investigate its correlation with their X-ray luminosity. A positive correlation between these two quantities may indicate a dominating jet-linked X-ray emission mechanism of inverse Compton scattering of the host-galaxy photon field produced by a starburst. With this mechanism, the enhanced star-forming activity at high redshifts can also explain the X-ray emission enhancement of these objects over their counterparts at lower redshifts. The lack of such far-infrared/X-ray correlation would support an alternative mechanism of the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons.',\n"," 'Searching for CO-dark H2 gas in radio jets. Our recent discovery shows that cosmic-rays (CRs) and X-rays destroy CO by converting it to CI while the H2-gas remains unaffected. This challenges the widely used CO-to-H2 conversion method in extreme environments, especially in outflows associated with radio emission. These outflows are strongly magnetised, with high densities of CRs and X-rays. Recent ALMA detections of CO in outflows associated with radio jets indicate that H2 can exist in such extreme environments. Therefore, we propose CI 1-0 observations in the radio jets of Minkowskis Object and M87, where CO lines have been detected. We aim at i) Detecting hidden H2 reservoir in radio jets, ii) determining the degree of CI-CO concomitance, iii) Disentangle shock- and CR-/X-ray chemistry, iv) estimating H2 outflow mass, and v) estimating star formation efficiency along the outflow by comparing with CO-based measurements. This will be a key experiment for testing our theoretical predictions that CI emission in both radio jets would be much brighter than scaled from CO lines under normal conditions of molecular clouds. If confirmed, it will open a new window for detecting H2-gas under extreme conditions.',\n"," 'Opacity Variability in Neptunes Troposphere. We request time (~2h) to view Neptune in the millimeter. Spatially resolved millimeter maps of Neptune reveal brightness temperature variations in Neptunes troposphere (1-5 bar). These variations are mostly due to latitudinal variations in opacity. Previous millimeter maps of Neptune were unable to resolve the source of these variations, e.g. CH4, H2S, or ortho/para H2. ALMA provides the resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage needed to constrain the source of opacity variations. Unraveling what contributes to the brightness variability is crucial for understanding Neptunes atmospheric circulation pattern.',\n"," 'First direct molecular gas measurements in normal z~4.5 star-forming galaxies. We propose a pilot project to observe the CO(5-4) line plus the dust continuum close to the IR peak in four normal, main sequence, star-forming galaxies at z~4.5. From this we will measure for the first time directly the molecular gas content, the corresponding gas fraction, and the molecular gas depletion timescale in such high redshift galaxies. The observations will also allow us to compare the direct measure of the molecular gas mass from CO to that estimated from the dust mass, assuming a constant dust-to-gas ratio. Our sources are selected from a large spectroscopic survey in a field with abundant ancillary data. Combined with recent and ongoing observations targeting z~2.7-3.5 galaxies, our ALMA measurements will allow us to study the redshift evolution of the molecular gas fraction and depletion timescales beyond z~2 and out to z~4.5. This will provide important tests and constraints on our understanding of gas accretion and star formation in the high redshift Universe.',\n"," 'Spectral line survey toward a hot molecular core in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Because cosmic metallicity is increasing in time with the evolution of our universe, interstellar chemistry in low metallicity environments is crucial to understand chemical processes in the past metal-poor universe. Based on our ALMA Cycle 1 program, we have identified a hot molecular core in a nearby low metallicity galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. The ALMA data suggests that the molecular abundances of the LMC hot core are significantly different from those of Galactic hot cores. The LMC hot core provide us great opportunities to investigate chemical compositions of complex organic molecules in low metallicity environments. However, since only limited spectral regions were observed during Cycle 1, the detailed chemical compositions of the LMC hot core still remain to be investigated. Here we propose an unbiased spectral line survey toward the LMC hot core in the 333-364 GHz region. A goal of this program is to unveil chemical compositions of a hot molecular core in the LMC, particularly focusing on chemistry of complex organic molecules, and to understand them in relation to the characteristic low metallicity environment.',\n"," 'Does the fine structure constant change with time ?. We propose to use the ALMA Band-6 receivers to obtain deep spectra in the redshifted CI 492 GHz and CO(4-3) 461 GHz transitions from the z=0.88582 lens towards PKS1830-210. A comparison between the redshifts of the fine-structure CI and rotational CO transitions provides a sensitive probe of changes in the fine structure constant and the proton-electron mass ratio. Using existing stringent constraints on changes in the proton-electron mass ratio from the same absorber, the proposed observations will yield the highest sensitivity to changes in the fine structure constant from any astrophysical method and will definitively confirm or deny the variations in the fine structure constant detected with the many-multiplet method. We request 38 minutes of time for this project, including all calibration and overheads.',\n"," 'Breaking Cosmic Dawn: Studying z~7 Galaxies with ALMA. Was reionization gradual or did it occur instantaneously? When did it occur and which sources were responsible? To answer these questions we need to unambiguously detect galaxies at z~7 and study their star formation properties. This proposal will achieve this by measuring [CII]line in a sample of z~7, highly magnified due to gravitational lensing, yet intrinsically ordinary galaxies selected from our large Spitzer and HST campaigns. All galaxies have spectroscopic detections from HST grism and/or Keck data and measured evolved stellar population from Spitzer data. We will also compare [CII] and UV/optical emission to the predictions from simulations, and investigate whether the relation between star formation rate and L[CII] differs from the local universe due to modified Kennicutt-Schmidt relation at z~7 or low metallicity. The proposed observations have sufficient resolution and depth due to gravitational lensing to test both scenaria. This proposal will thus firmly establish ALMA as a major facility for studies of galaxy formation at the reionization era.',\n"," 'Black hole mass measurements in the most MASSIVE Galaxies. Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs), as the end point of galaxy evolution, are the subject of intense interest. Yet, their complex formation histories remain obscure. In lower-mass objects black holes (BHs) are strongly correlated with properties of the stellar bulge implying co-evolution between the BH and stellar components. The BH mass in massive ETGs, however, does not correlate well with galaxy parameters. The most massive ETGs and their central BHs therefore may have followed different evolutionary paths from their less-massive counterparts. We propose here to complete our cycle-4, 5 and 6 observations of the molecular discs that lie in the heart of two of the most massive molecular gas hosting ETGs in the local universe, in order to estimate their SMBH masses. With these observations we can test the feedback paradigm, constrain the environmental dependance of SMBH-host galaxy relations, provide important cross-checks on SMBH mass measurement techniques and anchor studies of the SMBH-host galaxy relations which use molecular gas. In this way a short investment of ALMA time can help reveal more about the complex formation histories of the most massive galaxies in our universe.',\n"," 'Dense Gas Thermometry of Starburst Galaxies. A characterization of the physical properties of the dense gas within the interstellar medium of starburst galaxies is critical to our understanding of their evolution. Many of the molecular tracers used to characterize the dense gas in star-forming galaxies suffer from a coupled degenerate sensitivity to the kinetic temperature and volume density. A molecular tracer which can decouple individual physical conditions is required. Results from a survey of a sample of active star-forming galaxies has shown that Formaldehyde (H2CO) is a reliable and accurate density probe for extragalactic environments where the kinetic temperature is known. Ammonia (NH3) is a traditional probe of the kinetic temperature in dense gas environments, but its utility requires an assumption of cospatiality between dense gas tracers is required. Using the unique sensitivities to kinetic temperature afforded by the excitation characteristics of several transitions of H2CO, we propose to continue our characterization of the dense gas in galaxies exhibiting starbursts by imaging the gas kinetic temperature in a representative pilot sample of three starburst galaxies: Arp220, NGC253, and NGC4945.',\n"," 'The Explosive Orion OMC1 Outflow. The explosive Orion OMC1 outflow in the nearest site of active massive star formation (D~414 pc) may have been triggered by the dynamic ejection of massive stars ~500 years ago. The proposed 1\" resolution ALMA J=CO 2-1 mosaic will measure the mass and momentum of gas in near-IR shock-excited fingers protruding form the explosion site. 1.3 mm continuum and molecules will be used to search for dense high-velocity (>100 km/s) clumps expected at the [FeII]-bright fingertips, to measure the masses of dozens of proto-planetary disks in the foreground Orion Nebula and embedded protostars in OMC1, and to trace the 1.2 mm dust and free-free continuum in the field. The goals are: * Search for dust and measure radial velocities and masses of clumps in the fingertips. * Measure the mass, momentum, and structure of the gas along the H2 wakes. * Determine the masses of the circumstellar disks surrounding in dozens of YSOs. * Probe the relation between the ~500 year old OMC1 outflow and the 10\" long, 200 year old flow from source I.',\n"," 'The protosolar nebula heritage: measuring the nitrogen isotopic ratio in disks. In which forms were the chemical elements incorporated in the Solar System ? This broad topic is at the crossroads of several fields of investigation: cosmochemistry, astrobiology, and astrophysics. Because models are not able to follow the abundances of chemical species along the molecular cloud to star and planet forming sequence, this question can only be tackled observationally using ratios of stable isotopes. ALMA has the potential to revolutionize the question of our origins, by allowing us to trace our chemical history back into our parental and dispersed molecular cloud. This proposal focusses on nitrogen, a key element for terrestrial life, for which interstellar chemistry provides a consistent view of the isotopic ratios measured in embryos of star forming regions and in the protosolar nebula. Yet, one crucial measurement in the foregoing sequence is lacking, which may be key to the emerging picture of the chemical heritage of the protosolar nebula: namely, the nitrogen isotopic ratios in circumstellar disks. We propose to perform the first measurement of the 14N/15N ratio in the TW Hya disk, using CN as a carrier which is the best tracer of the bulk isotopic ratio.',\n"," 'Mapping the Inner Edge of a Kepler-Analog Circumbinary Protoplanetary Disk. Kepler discovered several circumbinary planets around short-period (P < 40 days) binary stars, indicating that circumbinary planets form readily. A key input to any circumbinary planet formation theory is the radius at which the dynamical tides from the (possibly eccentric) binary orbit truncate the inner edge of the protplanetary disk. Through moderate resolution observations in Cycle 4, we have discovered that a circumbinary disk, whose orbital properties broadly match the sample of Kepler circumbinary planets, hosts a large dust hole ~25 au in radius. The inner edge of the hole is azimuthally asymmetric, and is quite a bit further out in the disk than one would predict from classical truncation arguments alone. It is an open question as to whether the gap is indeed the result of influence from the binary, is carved by one or more giant planets, or is a consequence of the advanced age of the system (16 Myr). We propose for high resolution (0.02\"), sensitive dust continuum observations to map the asymmetry of the disk edge and determine whether the cavity is truly devoid of dust emission or contains the dynamical signatures of giant planets.',\n"," 'Towards an evolutonary sequence in young planetary mass companions. In recent years a small number of planetary mass companion candidates (PMCs) at large orbital distances from their host stars have been identified. Their formation mechanism remains unknown, but studying the PMCs that are still in formation is providing some vital clues. We have selected 5 young PMC candidates aiming for a detection of their circumplanetary disks through ALMA 1.3 mm observations. The proposed observations will be deep enough to provide strong constraints on the potential circumplanetary disk structure, the reservoir of proto-lunar material and its relation with the circumstellar emission. Our targets span a wide range of young ages, so the proposed observations could represent the starting point for establishing an evolutionary sequence for PMC formation.',\n"," 'The Magnetic Heart of NGC253s Starburst-Driven Wind. We propose Band 4 and 7 polarization observations of the central starburst region in the nearby galaxy NGC253. The proposed observations will trace the magnetic field structure at spatial scales between 5 and 200pc, yielding the first parsec-scale map of the magnetic field structure in the dense gas at the heart of a starburst system. The data will provide 10 times better linear resolution than the best existing radio polarisation map for NGC253, and increase the number of measurements of the dust polarisation in NGC253 by more than two orders of magnitude. This will permit a detailed study of the magnetic field geometry relative to wind-driven ISM structures at other wavebands. We will use the data to test MHD models for the survival of cold gas entrained in galactic winds, an important outstanding puzzle for galactic wind physics.',\n"," 'The Morphology of the Magnetic Field of HL Tau. The formation of disks around protostars is thought to be regulated through magnetic fields, and theoretical models suggest that the fractional polarization should be approximately 2-3%. Nevertheless, resolved observations of disks in T Tauri stars (TTS) have remained undetected and are constrained to have fractional polarization of less than 1%. However, with CARMA observations of HL Tau, we recently found the first detection of a resolved magnetic field about a TTS. Unfortunately, such observations have insufficient resolution to discern the true magnetic field morphology. Therefore, HL Tau is the quintessential source for follow-up ALMA observations. High resolution ALMA observations will allow us to discern the morphology of TTS magnetic fields, which will supply theory with the first observational constraint of the magnetic field morphology during the Class II stage of star formation.',\n"," 'Linking the Chemistry to the Morphology of the Ejecta of Supergiant VY Canis Majoris. High mass loss events are observed in evolved massive stars across the upper HR Diagram. The famous red supergiant VY CMa is the perfect star to explore these events. Previous optical spectroscopy and imaging of VY CMa revealed the 3-D morphology of its complex circumstellar ejecta and recent mass loss history. We propose to explore VY CMas chemical enrichment history and association of molecular gas with these specific mass loss events. We will focus on the oldest, larger-scale structures (Arc1, Arc 2, NW Arc), but also examine clumps closer to the star (e.g. Clump C), combined with previous ALMA data and single-dish spectra from the ARO 1 mm survey. We will observe molecules that trace varying densities (CO, CS, HCN), evaluate 12C/13C ratios (13CO and H13CN), and further explore carbon and sulfur chemistry. These data will establish the physical and chemical properties of individual arcs and clumps across the entire envelope, providing insight into mass loss mechanisms. We also will examine aluminum and phosphorus chemistry, imaging PO, PN, AlO, and AlOH, in order to understand their spatial relationships and the influence of dust condensation and shocks on their formation.',\n"," 'Very Low Luminosity Objects in Molecular Clouds. Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are young stellar sources that are defined by luminosities less than 0.1 solar luminosity and rising mid-infrared spectral energy distributions. But what exactly are they: brown dwarfs or low-mass stars in formation, systems exhibiting low accretion, extremely young objects? We propose to characterize the VeLLO class through observations of 1.3mm continuum and CO J=2-1 outflow emission of a sample of 21 likely candidates in the nearby Ophiuchus and Lupus molecular clouds. Combined with our successful Cycle-2 program, this survey is expected to triple the number of confirmed VeLLOs as well as extend the class to sources with even lower luminosities. Our observations will provide estimates of their inner envelope masses, and help address questions concerning the nature of VeLLOs.',\n"," 'ALMA Exploration of Cosmic Reionization with a Newly-Discovered Luminous Star-Forming Galaxy at z=7.31. We propose deep Band 6 observations of a very distant spectroscopically-confirmed star-forming galaxy newly-discovered by the powerful combination of Subaru imaging and Keck spectroscopy. This source, at a redshift of z=7.308, lies within the heart of the reionization era yet is bright enough for a robust detection of the diagnostic [CII] 158 micron line given ALMAs improved Cycle 1 performance. As [CII] arises from photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), its observed wavelength will provide an otherwise unattainable measure of the systemic velocity of this distant galaxy. In combination with our Lyman alpha profile and the statistics of line emission in our Subaru sample, we can secure a valuable measure of the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium at this early epoch. To date there are no such measures at such a high redshift. The fluxes of the 1.2mm dust continuum and [CII] line will also provide valuable data on the dust content and star formation rate of this early system. These properties are key not only for understanding reionization history, but also for characterizing the nature of star formation in early galaxies by providing new constraints on the cloud density and the far-UV radiation field of PDRs. By targeting the most distant robustly-confirmed galaxy accessible with the Cycle 1 capability, our observations will showcase the dramatic possibilities with ALMA and provide the first valuable step towards future studies of galaxies within the reionization era, including those exploiting samples that we expect to be discovered with upcoming deep imaging campaigns with HST and Spitzer.',\n"," 'The remarkable 268 GHz line of water: a new tracer of the inner wind of evolved stars?. We have detected a highly excited water emission line at 268.149 GHz in the v2=2 vibrational state from multiple oxygen-rich evolved stars in the sample of the ATOMIUM Large Program in Cycle 6. The upper energy level of this line is above 6000 K, well above most of the other commonly detected (sub)millimeter H2O transitions. Preliminary images from long-baseline observations of June/July 2019 indicate that the 268 GHz line arises from the inner wind close to the star. Since this line appears to be widespread among the observed targets, it has the potential to probe the physical conditions and kinematics of the densest gas within the dust formation zone of O-rich stars that is not accessible to other tracers at lower energy levels. High-spatial resolution images suggest this line exhibits maser action, but this is difficult to confirm with the low velocity resolution of 1.3 km/s of the main-array data. Hence, we propose to follow up on the discovery of this widespread H2O line with the ACA at a much better velocity resolution (0.14 km/s) to spectrally resolve its line profiles in the strongest sources.',\n"," 'Physical Conditions of the Young HL Tau disk. Growing numbers of observations suggest that the first steps of planet formation may be well underway when the disk is still surrounded by an infalling envelope. The fundamental physical conditions inside young embedded disks are still highly uncertain, especially on the gas mass distribution and thermal structure. The HL Tau disk is one of the youngest disk candidates for planet formation. We have carried out pathfinder observations of C18O/C17O/13C18O (2-1) lines (2\" resolution) towards the HL Tau disk and determined that 13C18O is the only optically thin tracer of the disk. Here we propose ALMA to spatially resolve the 13C18O/C17O (3-2) lines of the HL Tau disk at 0.3\" resolution to trace its gas mass distribution and the radial temperature structure. These observations will provide crucial data that can constrain physical conditions inside the best-studied early disk and demonstrate whether physical conditions in early disks are significantly different from those in Class II systems.',\n"," 'Observations of CO2 snowline tracer HCO2+ towards young bursting stars. Observationally locating the position of the CO2 snowline is crucial because it will constrain the physical and chemical conditions of disks and give information on modern theories of dust-grain growth and planet formation. However, because of the lack of a permanent dipole moment, CO2 itself cannot be observed with ALMA. Protonated carbon dioxide, HCO2+, could instead be a good tracer of the CO2 snowline position. The spatial distribution of HCO2+ is expected to be ring-shaped; the outer and inner edges of the ring corresponds to the positions of the CO2 and H2O snowlines. We here propose to confirm the effectiveness of this method and to investigate gas-phase CO2 abundance distributions by observing rotational transition lines of HCO2+ at Bands 3 and 6. Target sources are selected from young bursting stars, IRAS 15398-3359 and V883 Ori. The accretion burst is thought to be important in terms of thermal history of materials in planetary systems. One of our target HCO2+ lines has been detected towards the former object by previous single-dish survey observations, suggesting large line intensities enough for detection.',\n"," 'ALMA Mapping of a Great Case of Ongoing Ram Pressure Stripping in the Nearby Virgo Cluster. We propose to map CO(2-1), CO(3-2) and 870um continuum in the spiral NGC~4402, one of the best cases of active ram pressure stripping in the nearby Virgo cluster. HST images reveal a remarkable variety of ISM features associated with ongoing stripping that we would like to characterize, including kpc-scale head-tail filaments, small decoupled clouds, ablated extraplanar dust plumes, several-kpc-long extraplanar dust fronts, and leading edge star-forming complexes. We will measure cloud sizes, linewidths, masses (gas and dust), and CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) ratios, and compare cloud properties with various nearby galaxies, to learn whether the clouds which appear to be affected by ram pressure have distinct properties. We can determine the cloud mass function and its spatial variation, to explore whether ISM compression along the leading edge results in more massive clouds, and estimate the fraction of the ISM mass that decouples during stripping. Comparison of simulations with these detailed observations of gas being stripped from the disk will give us a better understanding of the efficiency of stripping, and therefore its impact as a quenching mechanism throughout the universe.',\n"," 'ALMA observations of an extreme stellar dimming. \"Little dipper\" stars are a recently discovered kind of variable main-sequence stars that exhibit small (~ a few %) dimming events, usually attributed to transiting exocomets in these systems. The most famous example of these objects is Boyajians star, which underwent a series of deep and aperiodic transits that decreased its stellar flux by up to 20% in some cases. Mechanisms such as a large family of exocomets and planetary collisions have been proposed to explain its peculiar behavior. A few days ago, the brightness of the Solar-type star ASASSN-21qj decreased by ~90% with respect to its quiescent value. This is, by far, the most extreme dimming event ever reported, maybe the result of large collisions of planetesimals in the system. We propose to obtain deep Band 7 continuum observations of ASASSN-21qj to search for sub-mm excess that would indicate the presence of mm-sized dust grains released in such collisions. A non-detection would place tight constraints on some of the most extreme scenarios that could explain this dimming event. These would represent the most sensitive (sub)mm observations to date of this mysterious kind of objects.',\n"," 'Triggering and supression of star formation in recent gas-rich minor mergers. Galaxy mergers are a crucial part of our galaxy evolution paradigm. Gas-rich & gas-poor mergers have been well studied. However a third intermediate class exists, where one of the merging objects has gas, and the other does not (gas-rich+gas-poor). Such mergers are quite common at low redshift, but have not been well characterised. A recent study suggests that mergers where a gas-rich minor companion is accreted onto a gas-poor central actually lead to very low efficiency star formation, in stark contrast to the starburst often observed in purely gas-rich mergers. In order to understand this phenomenon we here propose to observe a carefully constructed sample of gas-rich+gas-poor & gas-rich minor mergers with the ACA, revealing the compactness/dynamical state of their molecular reservoir, and how this relates to their star formation efficiencies, & those of a robust control sample selected from the literature. A short investment of ACA time will allow us to reveal how gas gas-rich+gas-poor mergers differ from better studied gas-rich mergers, and lay the ground work for future observational & theoretical efforts to fully resolve the physical processes behind these differences.',\n"," 'Double-ring debris disks at 10s of au: probing how far out planets can form. The census of exoplanets only shows a few with 10s of AUseparations. On the other hand, observations of debris disks have shown that planetesimals can form at large separations, but it is not yet clear how far planets can form. Debris disks provide a unique tool as they can reveal the presence of planets at tens of AU. HD92945 and HD107146 are uniquely placed to pursue this question because they have broad disks with double rings at 10s of AU that suggest the presence of planets at large separation. However, 3 different scenarios can explain this and differ in where the planets formed: 1) a planet formed in situ opens a gap in a broad disk by direct scattering and resonance overlap; 2) a planet that formed closer in and migrated outwards traps planetesimals in resonances; 3) an eccentric planet formed closer in, but was scattered out then opens a gap through secular interactions with the disk. These scenarios predict significant differences in the disks high resolution structure that are detectable by ALMA. We propose to observe these systems at a resolution of 0.6\" to disentangle the origin of the double rings and planet formation history at large separations in these systems.',\n"," 'HD 97048: A Planetary system in the making. HD 97048 is one of the brightest disks at 850 micron in the sky, and a prime target to observe at high angular resolution to look for ring systems such as recently observed in HL Tau and TW HYa. In our cycle 2 band 7 observations we detect radially a disk hole up to 50 au, and disk gaps at ~90 and ~260 au. Supplementary data point at more structure inside the disk gap. By observing this disk at 0.06\" resolution at band 7, we will resolve features ~10 au in size, while supplementary cycle 2 data allows us to trace structures out to ~2.5 arcseconds in radius. 13CO J=3-2 observations will, in concert with existing 12CO J=3-2 data, give a measure of the density and temperature inside and out of the gaps and hole. Both the dust and the gas observations will help diagnose the origin of the concentric gaps.',\n"," 'The dense gas star-formation law in dusty star-forming galaxies at z~2-4. Understanding the physical mechanisms triggering intense star formation in high-z dusty starburst galaxies requires probing the gas in a wide range of environments, including the densest cores of giant molecular clouds. These regions are the main sites of star formation but they remain little studied, especially at high-z, because they are opaque to the brightest, most common gas tracers. Here we propose to characterize the dense gas star-formation law in rapidly star-forming galaxies at z~2-4, by observing two mid-J transitions of HCO+, HCN, and HNC at 0.5-1.0\" resolution in four of the brightest, strongly lensed galaxies in the Southern sub-mm sky. The brightness and exquisite ancillary follow-up make these galaxies ideally suited for measuring intrinsic dense-gas line fluxes from spatially-resolved observations. This will provide us with a unique opportunity (1) to determine whether or not high-z starbursts follow the dense gas star-formation law found in less extreme, low-z environments; (2) to measure the dense gas mass fractions and depletion times; and (3) to constrain the local ratios between dense and more ambient gas phases and compare with low-z galaxies.',\n"," 'The galaxy-wide impact of powerful feedback in ULIRGs. In recent years, the SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) has enabled observations of high-J CO transitions (J = 5 to J = 13) for a large number of local Ultra Luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). These observations have been successfully used, together with low-J CO, mid-IR and far-IR spectral lines, in radiative transfer modeling codes (such as RADEX) to determine the relative contributions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), star formation, and mechanical heating to the energy budget, and to constrain the density, temperature and column density in different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM). While such studies abound for local ULIRGs, they include only 3 sources hosting strong molecular outflows, a key step in quenching star formation in the outflow host galaxy. Here, we propose to observe low-J CO lines from 9 local ULIRGs hosting powerful molecular outflows, which have near-complete observations of the mid/high-J CO lines, as well as mid-IR and FIR spectroscopy, in order to complete their CO SLED from J = 1-0 to J = 13 - 12. This will be the first statistical test for any galaxy-wide changes to the ISM and star formation in ULIRGs as a result of molecular outflows.',\n"," 'Dust structures in the beta Pictoris disk at high resolution. We propose to image the brightest debris disk - beta Pictoris - with ALMA in band 6. The primary aim is to study the distribution of mm-sized dust on scales from ~150AU down to ~7AU, near the planet beta Pic b. This will enable us to delineate the location of the colliding planetesimals - the ultimate cause of the debris cascade in such disks. We will compare this with the distribution of sub-micron grains seen in scattered light, the micron grains seen in the mid-IR and the location of the planet beta Pictoris b The results will be used to test models both of grain physics and of interactions of planets with debris disks. This will be applicable not only to beta Pic itself, but also to debris systems in general. The images will probe the mm-grain population of several intriguing structures, including the 100AU ring, the outer disk, inner clumps, as well as the warp or inclined disk. Simultaneously we will be performing a deep search for emission from the circumstellar CO and SiO in the disk, probing the origin of the gas and the nature of the parent planetesimals.',\n"," 'How do stellar bars alter the properties of the molecular gas disk. Analysis of the first 120pc resolution CO(2-1) maps from our PHANGS-ALMA LP reveals a tight relation between molecular gas surface density and line width, implying that molecular gas is close to energy balance across star-forming galaxy disks. Central regions in barred galaxies deviate markedly from the relation suggesting that bars significantly alter molecular gas properties. We propose 0.25\" (20pc) high-resolution follow-up observations for 6 carefully selected, barred, CO-bright galaxies with large line widths, covering a diverse set of morphologies/bar properties. The sample size ensures robustness against effects of (fast) time evolution. The proposed data will test four physical mechanisms to explain these surprising results: (a) intra-cloud motion (b) stellar feedback from nuclear star formation (c) large-scale shocks induced by the bar (d) coupling of internal cloud kinematics to orbital motions Understanding which physical mechanism(s) cause the centers to behave differently is key to link molecular gas structure and physics to star formation (from PHANGS-HST) in this unique environment, providing a key link to modelling and observations of the CMZ in our own galaxy.',\n"," 'Unviased Chemical Survey of Protostellar Sources in Perseus. It is well known that low-mass protostellar cores show significant chemical diversity. One distinct case is hot corino chemistry characterized by rich saturated complex organic molecules, while the other distinct case is warm carbon chain chemistry (WCCC) characterized by rich carbon-chain molecules. However, the number of sources definitively classified into them are limited, and the statistics is apparently poor. We here propose to conduct an unbiased survey of chemical composition toward 37 Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud complex. Our recent observations toward these target sources with the single-dish telescopes shows clear chemical diversity, where many intermediate sources are found between the two distinct cases. We are going to confirm this result with ALMA to establish chemical diversity in the 200 AU scale. A relative occurrence of each category (hot corino chemistry, WCCC, or intermediate) as well as preferential association of the sources in each category with a specific part of the cloud complex will give us an important clue to understanding the origin of the chemical diversity in terms of evolutionary history and/or environmental effects.',\n"," 'Formation of sulphur allotropes in the Horsehead nebula. The Horsehead nebula is the only ISM source in which S2H has been detected. Therefore, it is the unique testbed to investigate the formation of long sulphur chains (allotropes) in space thus far. It has been proposed that S2H is formed when H2S ice is irradiated by UV photons. High sensitivity mapping with the ACA will allow us to determine the spatial distribution of both molecules, hence providing valuable information on the S2H formation route and its efficiency. The detection of S2H makes this source the most promising object to search for sulphur allotropes. In particular, we will search for S3, the following chemical step to form long sulphur chains. The detection of S3 will be the first one in the ISM and would confirm that long sulphur chains are an important sulphur resevoir in the interstellar medium. The observation of high excitation transitions of other abundant sulphur-bearing species such as 13CS, SO, OCS and SO2 would help to constrain sulphur chemistry in the transition between the photon-dominated region and the molecular cloud. This project is the fundamental stone on which to build our knowledge of the formation of sulphur allotropes in the ISM.',\n"," 'First characterisation of a directly imaged protoplanet and its natal environment with ALMA. With this proposal, we aim to characterise the transition disk around PDS 70, in particular the local environment of PDS 70 b, a protoplanet which we recently discovered with the SPHERE imager. We will observe PDS 70 b and its direct environment at high angular and spectral resolution using ALMA in Band 7 to study the gas kinematics of the CO isotopologues and trace the planets imprints on the velocity field. Further, we will search for circumplanetary dust in the continuum. If detected, this would be the first direct detection of a circumplanetary disk. The proposed observations will allow for the characterisation of this planetary system, observed in both, NIR and sub-mm regime. They will provide excellent and unique laboratory for understanding the formation and evolution of CPDs, the accretion onto the planet and through the TD gap onto the central star itself.',\n"," 'Spectroscopic Follow-up of Two Luminous Galaxy Candidates in the Epoch of Reionization. The exploration of the early universe and luminous sources therein has been significantly advanced through synergistic strategies across multiple facilities. Remarkably, sub-mm follow-up observations by ALMA of high-z source candidates selected from UV-to-near-infrared observations have opened up a new frontier and enabled us to witness the early evolution of galaxies at the early stage of cosmic reionization. We here propose follow-up observations of 2 luminous (MUV~-22) galaxy candidates at z ~8 with ALMA Band 6. These galaxies were selected from one of the approved Cycle1 JWST GO programs. Our goal is to securely determine the redshift of these galaxies via spectral scanning, targeting the [C II] 158m line. The line is detectable with ~30 minutes on-source exposure per source. Detection of [C II] by our observations will confirm these galaxies as one of the most luminous sources in the epoch of reionization and enable future investigation of their ISM properties with the spectroscopic dataset provided by JWST/NIRSpec. Even non-detection will be a valuable outcome, by providing the JWST GO team an opportunity to finalize their observing targets.',\n"," 'Explaining the puzzling SiO emission toward G331.639+00.501: a high-mass starless cluster-forming clump. A remarkable discovery of recent Galactic Plane surveys, was the presence of quiescent, starless clumps exhibiting widespread SiO emission. These clumps appear dark in the infrared, have low dust temperatures (<20 K) and show no signs of current star formation. Since the SiO emission is usually associated with outflows from newly formed stars, the detection of SiO toward quiescent starless clumps is unusual. We propose to study G331.639+00.501, a quiescent high-mass proto-cluster candidate that exhibits widespread SiO emission. Using ALMA, we will obtain a mosaic of the SiO and dust emission across it to determine whether the SiO emission is due to: (1) outflows from a distributed population of low-mass proto-stars, implying perhaps that low-mass stars have already formed within the clump OR (2) large scale flows due to a recent cloud-cloud collision, which would suggest that we are witnessing clump formation. In either case, these observations will reveal the small-scale distribution of SiO emission toward this cluster-forming clump.',\n"," 'SUPERCOLD-CGM: a high-z survey of molecular gas across the circum-galactic medium of Enormous Lya Nebulae. Massive galaxies at high-z are known to co-evolve with their circum-galactic medium, generally detected in Ly-alpha. However, a direct link between this CGM and the stellar growth of massive galaxies remained missing: we had yet to identify the reservoir of halo gas that can fuel widespread star-formation, namely cold molecular gas (~10-100 K). Following the discovery of a cold CGM in the Spiderweb and two other Lya nebulae, we propose to use ALMA + ACA to perform the first systematic survey of the molecular medium in a sample of 10 QSO-powered Enormous Lya Nebulae (ELANe) at z~2 for which 3D Lya imaging from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager is available. We will simultaneously target the low- and high-density gas tracers CI 3P0-3P1 and CO(4-3) to obtain the mass, extent, composition and physical properties of the multi-phase CGM. In addition, a commensal continuum study will be performed for free in search for the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect from quasar winds that deposit material into the CGM. Studying the multi-phase CGM with sensitive surface-brightness ALMA+ACA observations opens an exciting new window for investigating the early formation of the most massive galaxies in the Universe.',\n"," 'Wide-field imaging of dense gas in the nearby barred galaxxy M83. We propose to make a sensitive mosaic observations of the nearby barred galaxy M83 in HCN (J=1-0). The cycle0 observations of M83 in 12CO (1-0) enabled us to identify ~200 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) over wide range of galactic environments. Comparison with the HII regions indicated that progress of star formation strongly depends on the ratio between two time scales, namely free-fall time and crossing-time. In addition, by adopting a star formation law (SF-law) which relates, SFR, gas mass, and the two time scales, excellent agreement between the observation and the model were obtained for the radial distribution based analyses. Motivated by this finding, we aim to investigate the formation process of dense gas in terms of its environmental dependence, with the deep HCN observation. Since gas clouds denser than 1e4 cm-3 is known to be the basic unit of star formation, to verify the environmental dependence of SF-law, it is more essential to clarify the formation process of such dense gas. By comparing the deep HCN data with the CO data, and with the already available working hypothesis (time scale dependence of SF), we will address the formation process of dense gas.',\n"," 'Powering sources and Lya escaping fractions of Lyman alpha Blobs in the SSA22 field. \"Lyman alpha blobs\" (LABs) are spatially extended Lya nebulae seen at high redshift. The origin of Lya emission is unclear. We have observed 35 LABs in the SSA22 field with JCMT and ALMA, and revealed that 11 out of 18 big LABs are detected at submm wavelengths, but none of the 17 smaller ones. We propose deep ALMA observations towards 24 submm-undetected LABs at band 7. Our science goals are the following. First, it is mandatory to observe the small LABs to find out whether SMGs are common in all LABs and to find out that whether there is a uniform powering source for all LABs or whether the sample is more diverse. Secondly, deep ALMA observations will reveal in some cases that internal powering may not be the only mechanism powering the extended Lyman alpha emission. Thirdly, the escape fractions of Lya photons of the submm-detected LABs are significantly lower than those from the Lyman alpha Emitters in other studies. Thus, it is important to determine the Lya escape fractions of the submm-undetected LABs, the majority of the sample, enabling us to investigate the possible connection between the low Lya escape fractions and the physically extended Lya emission in some LABs.',\n"," 'Formation of VLM stars and BD in Lambda Orionis Star Forming Region (LOSFR). ACA view of LDN1589. For over 10 years, our group has led an ambitious multi-wavelength project to study key aspects of stellar and substellar formation in the LOSFR. For the central cluster, we determined the membership, IMF, and constrained possible substellar formation mechanisms, activity, accretion, disk fractions. One of its dark clouds, B30, has been observed from optical to radio; we studied the earliest stages of substellar objects as well as the radio data. ALMA Band 7 data allowed us to detect 3 very low-mass compact sources. With this proposal we focus on one of the youngest dark clouds of the LOSFR, LND1589, for which we have archival data from the optical to the mid-infrared, and submm data taken by our group at 870um using APEX/LABOCA. We propose ACA Band 6 observations (along with our APEX project) to: i) obtain spectral index information on sources detected in both projects, ii) improve our selection function to identify candidates to be followed up with the 12m array, iii) build a larger poll of pre/proto-substellar objects to put strong constraints on the proposed formation mechanisms.',\n"," 'Probing the Host Galaxy of the Most Massive Black Hole at the End of Reionization. We recently discovered an ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802 at z=6.30, the most luminous known quasar at z>6, powered by a 12 billion M_sun supermassive black hole (SMBH). This discovery strongly challenges theories of SMBH formation. What triggered the extreme BH accretion? Did its host galaxy grow in lockstep with or lag behind the BH? Early PdBI observations show a strong dust continuum and [CII] detection, implying a star formation rate of ~1000 M_sun/yr. We propose to carry out spatially resolved ALMA observations of J0100+2802 to map the dust continuum and [CII] emission of its host galaxy. ALMA observations, combined with HST imaging, will measure the distribution of star formation and dust obscuration in the quasar host galaxy and allow detailed dynamical modeling to estimate the host galaxy mass, probing whether SMBH growth proceeds galaxy assembly. We will search for signatures of galaxy merger and AGN feedback as well as companion [CII] emitters in the highly biased quasar environment. These observations will provide crucial tests to the evolutionary stage of the host galaxy and the triggering mechanism of the most massive SMBHs at the end of cosmic reionization.',\n"," 'Mysterious millimeter excess of radio continuum spectrum in the merging Seyfert galaxy NGC 985 with double nucleus. Aim: We propose to confirm the presence of millimeter excess, which was inferred from the radio continuum up to 43 GHz toward the Seyfert nucleus in the undergoing merger galaxy NGC 985 with double nucleus, by using ALMA at ~100 GHz. Scientific Impact: The possible physical processes are synchrotron radiation from accretion disks corona including nonthermal particles or extremely frustrated radio jets in highly dense environment around the merging nuclei. Any of them is observationally the first case, if we detect it successfully. Why do we need ALMA?: On the basis of our previous VLA observations at 8--43 GHz, the millimeter excess is expected to be ~2 mJy, which was negative detection in our observation using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array at 100 GHz.',\n"," 'High-resolution mapping of molecular gas in starbursts at z ~ 1.5. We propose to determine the molecular gas distribution with ALMA at high resolution of three starbursts (Herschel-detected) galaxies at z ~ 1.5 using the CO 5-4 emission line. A spatial resolution of 0.1-0.25\" enables us to derive kinematic and morphological information on physical scales of 0.8-2 kpc. Our galaxies have total CO fluxes (hence gas masses) from previous ALMA observations that may indicate a higher efficiency of converting gas to stars as responsible for their elevation well-above the star-forming main sequence at z ~ 1.5. This sample is selected from a spectroscopic near-infrared survey of star-forming galaxies in COSMOS with Subaru-FMOS that provides dust-corrected Halpha-based SFRs, metallicities, ionization conditions, and dust extinction using rest-frame optical emission lines. These ALMA observations will further elucidate the nature of sites of extreme star-formation within individual starbursts including their gas density, dust content and star formation efficiency.',\n"," 'Turbulence in a Sample of Protoplanetary Disks. Turbulence is a central component of planet formation theory, yet observational constraints on its magnitude and spatial distribution have so far been scarce. In a pilot study of HD 163296 ALMA Science Verification CO(3-2) emission we found that the high spatial resolution data were able to limit turbulence to less than 3% of the local sound speed. This upper limit is almost an order of magnitude lower than predicted from theory, but it is not clear if this result is unique to this source. Here we propose to extend the sample to include new CO observations of three additional sources. When combined with our constraints in HD 163296, and archival ALMA observations of TW Hya, this sample will cover a wide range of ionizing flux, a crucial parameter for setting the size of the MRI-active region. Additional observations of 13CO and C18O will be used to distinguish between MRI and gravito-turbulence based on the distinct predictions for the vertical turbulent velocity gradient from these two theories of the angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'Debris Disk Structure Disentangled. We propose observations of a coherent sample of three edge-on disks that have all been spatially resolved at submm wavelengths and have asymmetric structures observed in scattered light. These disks share two common properties. The first is a well-defined ring of planetesimals, and the second is wings of diffuse dust, which probably come from dynamical interaction either within the disk or between the disk and interstellar medium. Our proposed observations will perform three critical functions: first, unambiguously identify the stable planetesimal belts in three edge-on disks by tracing the location of large (mm-sized) grains out to large radii and determine if these belts are circular or eccentric and therefore perturbed; second, unambiguously determine if non-planetary interaction in the form of interstellar medium ablation is occuring by looking for large grains out of the midplane, and third, measure the grain emission in the same regions as scattered light is observed thereby providing grain albedos.',\n"," 'The V4046 Sgr Disk: A Benchmark for Planetesimal Evolution_(Rev_0.8). We propose a 2-hour \"compact\" configuration observation of the CO 6-5 line and 700 GHz continuum emission from the unique, nearby (73 pc), and \"old\" (8-20 Myr) disk around V4046 Sgr. The proximity and age of this massive, gas-rich disk offer a rare opportunity to observe the subtle effects produced by the growth and migration of its solid contents with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The proposed ALMA observations will be used in tandem with our SMA data (CO 2-1 and 230 GHz continuum) to make two key measurements: (1) use the resolved CO 6-5/2-1 line ratio to determine the gas temperature profile and effective size of the gas disk relative to the dust, a key indirect diagnostic of the radial variation in the gas-to-dust ratio that should be induced by the inward radial drift of solids; and (2) compare the continuum emission morphologies at 700 and 230 GHz to search for evidence of the particle size segregation expected in solid migration models. Although studying these effects is a relatively new topic enabled only now with the start of ALMA science operations, the size and spatial evolution of disk solids is perhaps the most fundamental aspect of the early stages of planet formation. The V4046 Sgr disk is an ideal proving ground for planning future observations of these effects, as well as for highlighting how ALMA data permit rapid, significant progress toward more sophisticated analyses of circumstellar disk evolution and the formation of planetary systems.',\n"," 'Dissecting the ISM of a normal star-forming disk at z=4.5 down to the 500 pc scale. We propose a deep and very high resolution (500 pc) observation of a main-sequence rotator at z=4.5. While the sub-kpc ISM structure in high-redshift starbursts/SMGs has been explored, normal z>4 systems remain an uncharted territory at this resolution. Because of its high surface brightness, its HST and planned JWST observations (COSMOS-Web), VC875 is by far the best candidate to start this type of observations. These observations will resolve the gas clouds, which are the seeds of star formation, and provide high quality dynamical information. We will: 1) reveal the small-scale ISM properties of VC875, detect giant molecular clouds, and measure their dynamical mass; 2) study the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation; 3) probe the baryon cycle by detecting possible outflows and unveiling the nature of the [CII] halo of VC875; 4) measure from the dynamics the total mass distribution and its connection with the gas and stellar components. In addition, three lower-z (z=1.3,2.0, and 3.4) bright continuum sources are located in the same pointing, allowing for free very high-resolution comparisons of dust versus stellar morphologies, together with the local variations of dust attenuation.',\n"," 'Mapping Envelope Kinematics in Filamentary Environments: Completing the Pilot Program. We propose to complete a pilot Band 6 study of the envelope kinematics of three Orion protostars selected from the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey. These observations are motivated by our recent ALMA maps of three edge-on, relatively isolated protostars in Orion, showing evidence for highly asymmetric infall, in sharp contrast to typical models which assume axisymmetry. We propose to extend our infall study to three protostars found in filamentary environments. These environments are selected to span the range of surface densities/mass to length ratios in the Orion A cloud. We can then study the processes that control low mass star formation by comparing infall between filamentary and (previous mapped) isolated sources and between filaments of different densities. We will use C18O and 13CO to trace envelope motions from the filament to the protostars, augmented by H2CO as a dense gas tracer, N2D+ to trace gas where CO is frozen out, and CO and SiO to trace outflows. Cycle 3 observations were obtained with the ACA and TP, we ask for time to complete the 12 meter observations here.',\n"," 'An ALMA survey to unveil the main mode of star formation in the early Universe. In recent years, convincing evidence have been accumulated that galaxies built up their stellar mass through a steady, diffuse and inefficient gas conversion dominantly taking place in non-interacting disk dominated galaxies. This has been confirmed at least up to z~3, beyond that even the deepest Herschel and JVLA surveys are not able to probe deep enough in L_IR sensitivity to detect normal massive galaxies. Thanks to exceptional ALMA sensitivity we are now in the position to easily detect a statistical sample of normal star forming galaxies at z~4 and test, for the first time, if the secular mode of stellar mass growth extends over all cosmic time.',\n"," 'Characterizing X-ray driven molecular chemistry in the disk population of Orion. The chemistry of protoplanetary disks sets the initial compositions of newly formed planets. Disk abundances typically evolve slowly, over timescales spanning 0.01-1 Myr. Consequently, it was a surprise when ALMA observations taken over a single year significantly varied in H13CO+ emission, an X-ray sensitive molecule. Given the known X-ray variability of disk-hosting stars, one promising theory is variable X-rays are driving variations in the composition of the disk. The present proposal aims to test this hypothesis by observing a group of ten disk-hosting young stars in Orion with both ALMA and Chandra, to definitively catch the smoking gun of X-ray driven chemistry. If confirmed, the proposed program is likely only the beginning of what is essentially a new field of time domain astrochemistry.',\n"," 'A snapshot of planet assembly in a solar nebula analogue. We request ALMA Band 7 observations to map the planet forming region of the disk around the young solar analogue star LkCa15 at a spatial resolution of 5 AU. Near-infrared and millimeter-wave observations of this source have revealed a complex disk morphology which likely resulted from the interation with young giant planets. This hypotesys is supported by the detection of Halpha emission from a putative massive planet orbiting at about 15 AU from the central star. Our project has two goals: (1) To detect the circumplanetry disk surrounding the candidate young accreting planet. (2) To investigate the interaction between the candidate planet and the circumstellar material. The proposed observations aim at obtaining the first robust detection of a forming planet in the microwave regime.

We propose Band 7 observations of the low-mass protobinary L1551 IRS 5 with ACA + ALMA 12-m array to seamlessly reveal the detailed structure of circumstellar material: i.e., from the infalling envelope with sizescale 13, or 1800 AU, down to the binary separation of 0.3, or 42 AU. Accurate measurements of the mass infall rate in the envelope and the centrifugal radius, where the transition from infall to pure rotation is taking place, will allow us to directly derive the ``input rate of the angular momentum to the binary system. This is the first step to observationally elucidate the connection between the angular momentum in the envelope and the formation of a binary. We unveil fine structure of transition zone from infall to purely-rotating motion. This will allow us to examine the efficiency of outward transportation of angular momentum in the circumbinary disk. At the same time, we will be able to search for an inner clearing in the circumbinary disk and to determine its size. This is a necessary prelude for observations at even higher angular resolutions to search for accretion streams that penetrate this clearing to feed material onto the circumstellar disks of the individual protostars.',\n"," 'A hybriod scenario for extreme starbursts in high-redshift SMGs. We propose 0.06arcsec (400pc)-resolution observations of CO(4-3) line in the brightest, unlensed SMG at z=4, AzTEC-1. The goal is to reveal the physical mechanisms of extreme starbursts in massive galaxies at high-redshift. In ALMA cycle-3, our high-resolution (150-500pc) 860um dust continnum observations reveal that AzTEC-1 hosts a nuclear starburst with an extremely high far-infrared luminosity surface density and have several clumps on the underlying extended structure. These findings suggest a hybrid scenario, that is a late-stage merging starburst plus an extended, gravitationally unstable disk, to explain the physical properteis of AzTEC-1. In the proposed CO observations, we will study the kinematics in the central region and the outer extended structure to verify the hybrid scenario. The results can be directly compared to central regions in local LIRGs/ULIRGs at same spatial resolution in physical scale. Even for one target, this pioneering work about the new scenario will have a strong impact on galaxy formation models.',\n"," 'Spatially resolved kinematics and SFRs of direct progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z = 2. The discovery of the \"red nugget\" population (massive, compact, quiescent galaxies) at z = 2 indicates that early passive galaxies were remarkably compact compared to their present-day elliptical counterparts. Recent HST observations have identified a likely population of progenitors: similarly massive and compact galaxies that are dusty and star-forming. While several pieces of indirect evidence link these two populations, resolution and sensitivity limitations in optical/NIR observations prevent a direct confirmation. Only the unique capabilities of ALMA in the FIR can provide definitive confirmation of this evolutionary connection. We propose to obtain high spatial resolution (FWHM=0.14) CO and [CI] velocity maps, and 1.2 mm continuum observations on 4 dusty, compact SFGs at z~2 to answer the following questions: a) what are the kinematic properties of their molecular gas? (ordered rotation vs. large dispersion), b) is the molecular gas profile as compact as the stellar mass and SFR sizes (FWHM=0.2 and 0.14), c) do they have short quenching (gas depletion) timescales consistent with the rapid build up the quiescent population at z = 2?.',\n"," 'Scrutinizing the properties of AGN dusty molecular torus. We propose ALMA band 6 high angular resolution (<0.07\") HCN 3-2 observation of the nucleus of the prototypical type-2 AGN, NGC 1068.

This is a very important milestone to scrutinize the properties of dusty molecular torus which are still poorly understood observationally. In this proposal, we aim to spatially resolve the compact torus molecular emission to investigate its dynamics and to obtain an important clue about its origin. Additionally, we aim to investigate the possibly detected emission in our ALMA Cycle 2 data which may bridge between the torus and bright eastern knot in the host galaxy, to confirm if we are witnessing molecular gas inflow from the host galaxy to the torus.

The Japanese Venus orbiter AKATSUKI was successfully inserted into the Venus orbit on 7 Dec. 2015, and regular science operations just started in March 2016. This ALMA observation is proposed as a coordinated ground-based program to complement the AKATSUKI Radio Science (RS) experiments. We aim at revealing the thermal structure (together with the CO distribution and wind) of the dayside hemisphere of Venus middle atmosphere, which is not well understood from past observational studies conducted at much lower spatial resolution. Simultaneous Band-6 12CO and 13CO observations will enable us to constrain the thermal structure at altitudes 80-95 km, a vertical range that complements that of the temperature profile sounded by AKATSUKI RS. AKATSUKI RS can measure the temperature profile only at very localized areas, and therefore the high resolution mapping capability of ALMA will also be a strong support for interpretation of AKATUSKI RS data in terms of horizontal variation. Dates of AKATSUKI RS operation are restricted by the spacecrafts orbit. The period from March to early May in 2016 is the best, providing a unique opportunity to conduct collaborative observations using ALMA.',\n"," 'Nitrogen chemistry in Eta Carninae. Eta Carniae is one of the most extreme stars in the Universe. This source has underwent massive mass ejections which have formed a complex ejecta around this source: an external Oxygen rich cocoon, with an inner cavity splattered with Nitrogen-rich condensations, and in the innermost regions, the Homunculus nebula result of a 10 solar masses eruption in 1840. As expected from the nucleosysntesys models, this object presents an important Nitrogen enrichment. In addition to this, this enrichment presents a variation as we move further from the star. However, the origin of this variation is not clear. Only recently, the first molecules have been detected towards Eta Carinae, most of the corresponding to N-bearing molecules. We aim to complete this sampling of N-rich species, locate them, and resolve the different kinematical features observed in Single-dish observations. For this purpose, we ask for high angular resolution maps, with a S/N ratio reachable remarkably fast due to the expected strength of the selected lines.',\n"," 'A Search for Pyridine and Pyrimidine on TItan. We propose to search spectroscopically for the small cyclic molecules pyridine (C5H5N) and pyrimidine (C4H4N2) in Titans atmosphere using ALMA Band 6. The presence of pyridine is inferred from the detection of the C5H5H+ ion by the Cassini mass spectrometer (INMS) in the ionosphere. Other species first detected by direct sampling of the ionosphere (C3H6, C2H5CN) have later been confirmed spectroscopically in the dense neutral atmosphere (Nixon et al, 2013; Cordiner et al. 2015). Benzene, the only presently confirmed ring molecule, has been detected in both ionosphere and stratosphere. The detection of pyridine would be a major discovery in astrochemistry, since no N-substituted rings have previously been detected in space. The closely related molecule pyrimidine has profound astrobiological significance, as it forms the backbone ring for two of the four nucleobases (thymine and cytosine). This project, uniquely possible with ALMAs capabilities in ~4 hr of time, has the potential for making a major advance in our understanding of planetary atmospheres and for the formation of prebiotic molecules in astronomical environments.',\n"," 'Detecting the molecular CGM around an AGN at z=2. We request ACA observations of the CO(3-2) and [CI](2-1)+CO(7-6) line in correspondence of an X-ray selected AGN at z~2 that is part of the SUPER survey. Our previous ALMA and APEX observations of this source suggest the presence of molecular gas on scales of 40\", corresponding to more than 300 kpc. We propose to use the ACA capability at its best to confirm and increase the S/N of such detection, which would be the first detection of molecular gas on scales of 100s of kpc in an isolated galaxy (i.e. not a protocluster), out to the boundary between the circumgalactic and the intergalactic medium. The combination of the proposed ACA observations with our previous CO(3-2) data (resolution ~1\") obtained with the ALMA 12m-array will allow us to trace the molecular gas from the inner ISM-scales of a few kpcs out to scales of 100s kpc into the CGM, which is currently not available for any other galaxy at z~2. Furthermore, by combining these observations with our previous VLT/SINFONI observations of the ionised ISM and outflow in this target, we will study the link between kpc-scale outflowing features and the large-scale CGM.',\n"," 'Imaging the candidate binary SMBH in OJ287. We propose 1 mm EHT+ALMA observations of the BL Lac object OJ287, one of the best candidates for hosting a binary SMBH and to study jet formation in magnetically dominated AGN. The improvement in the north-south resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA and the comparison with quasi-simultaneous, resolution-matched 3 mm GMVA+ALMA and 1.3 cm space VLBI RadioAstron images will allow us to perform Faraday rotation synthesis and opacity analysis approaching linear scales of 26 Rs. This would allow determination of the spectral energy distribution in the jet and the three dimensional structure of the magnetic field to test the binary SMBH scenario and to test magnetically driven jet formation models. In particular we plan to i) search for a secondary VLBI core/jet to confirm the binary SMBH model; ii) determine the spectral properties of the central region; iii) determine the orientation and strength of the magnetic field, and the location of jet transition from Poynting-flux to kinetic energy-dominance; iv) resolve the Faraday screen of the accretion flow around the SMBH and the inner jet, and derive the mass accretion rate; v) discriminate between BBH model and rotation jet-model.',\n"," 'Evolution of ISM, Star Formation and Starbursts. We propose to extend our extremely successful program of measuring interstellar (ISM) masses in high-z galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our technique uses optically thin dust emission as a proxy for the ISM gas mass -- calibrated using Planck observations of the Milky Way, nearby galaxies and SMGs at z ~ 2. The sensitivity and resolution of ALMA make the technique very quick and reliable (avoiding issues of CO conversion factors). In Cycle 2, we found very large increases in the ISM masses as one goes above the main sequence and at higher z. Confirmation of this important result requires observations of a larger and IR-complete sample. We propose 368 galaxies in the redshift ranges z = 1-2, 2-3 and 3-5 (43% with spectroscopic redshifts). All have good detections with Herschel, providing a reliable accounting of the dust-obscured star formation and AGN. These extensive samples will be used to map the evolution of ISM mass as a function of redshift, galactic stellar mass, and star formation rate relative to the main sequence. 59 of the galaxies have X-ray AGN to be compared with non-AGN samples.',\n"," 'Revealing Fragmentation of the Nearest Precluster Clump in Serpens South. The majority of stars form in clusters. Therefore, understanding the formation process of clusters is a key step toward a full understanding of how stars form. However, the initial conditions of cluster formation remain to be elucidated observationally because once active star formation is initiated, the stellar feedback such as protostellar outflows and radiation rapidly shapes their surroundings, making it difficult to track back the physical conditions of the clumps prior to active cluster formation, i.e., pre-protocluster clumps. On the other hand, recent 3D numerical simulations suggest that the physical conditions of pre-protocluster clumps determine some properties of forming clusters. Therefore, it is of great importance to reveal the physical conditions of the pre-protocluster clumps observationally. Recently, we discovered a NEAREST pre-protocluster clump that is located in the Serpens South infrared dark cloud (IRDC) at a distance of ~400 pc. Here, we propose a mosaic observation toward the nearest pre-protocluster clump with the finest spatial resolution of 1000 AU (~2.5\") and reveal its internal structure and physical conditions.',\n"," 'New method to dynamically determine stellar mass of young stars. We developed a new method to dynamically determine stellar masses of young stars by maximizing the autocorrelation between molecular-line data cube of their surrounding disks and various Keplerian rotational patterns. We have applied this method to the ALMA data of 13CO (3-2) of the young stars in Lupus. We successfully obtained 16 measurements of dynamical stellar masses. Our measured dynamical masses are consistent with the spectroscopically determined stellar masses within the 1-2 sigma uncertainties. In the current 13CO data, the on-source integration time is only 1 minute per source. With this limited integration time, we achieved an accuracy of 30%-50% in dynamical mass with our new method. However, this accuracy is not sufficiently high to calibrate stellar evolutionary models used in the spectroscopic method, which has a typical uncertainty of 10-20%. Thus, we propose ALMA observations of 25 stars with 5-10 minute integration per source to improve the accuracy of our dynamical mass determination by a factor of 2 to 3. Thus, we will make a statistically significant comparison between the two determinations and potentially even calibrate stellar evolutionary models.',\n"," 'Exploring New 183 GHz Megamasers in Seyfert 2 Galaxies. The exquisite sensitivity of ALMA in Band 5 has invigorated interest in identifying and studying new extragalactic water vapor megamasers at 183 GHz. The recent study by Pesce et al. (2023) demonstrates that 183 GHz megamasers can be commonly detected in galaxies already known to host 22 GHz megamaser disks. In this proposal, we seek to discover new megamaser galaxies - i.e. not previously detected at 22 GHz - by their 183 GHz emission. We have selected a set of 38 Sy 2 galaxies best suited for this initial study based on their distance, location on the sky, and visual magnitude. The discovery of new 183 GHz megamasers from this proposal will provide an immediate estimate of the ubiquity of this promising maser transition, identify new galaxies for supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements using ALMA, and motivate the development of future VLBI facilities for Band 5 observations. ALMA will thereby pioneer the use of the 183 GHz line as a new tool to investigate the physical conditions and geometries of accretion disks, probe SMBHs in active galaxies, and improve future geometric measurements of the Hubble Constant based on the megamaser method.',\n"," 'Fast outflows quenching star formation at high redshift. According to theoretical models, quasar driven outflows at high redshift clean massive galaxies of their gas content and quench star formation. We have recently discovered powerful AGN-driven outflows by studying the velocity field of [OIII]5007 in three quasars at z~2.4. The spatial distribution of the starforming regions in their host galaxies is anticorrelated with the presence of fast outflows, providing the very first evidence of quasar feedback quenching star formation. However, this evidence is tentative as it is based only on rest-frame optical spectra. We propose to map CO(3-2) to trace the distribution of the cold molecular gas in the three quasars, the only ones known so far showing evidence of outflows quenching star formation. The CO(3-2) maps will be compared with our [OIII] maps with similar spatial resolution: the molecular gas should be absent in the outflow dominated region, while surviving in the rest of the galaxy. This would be the first direct confirmation of star formation quenching by quasar outflows. Our ALMA observations will then open the way for the physical characterization of quasar driven feedback in larger samples of objects.',\n"," 'The far-infared [OIII] line emissivity of high-z low-metallicity galaxies. Herschel observations of nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxies have shown that the [OIII] 88 micron line tends to be stronger than the [CII] 158 micron line, while the opposite is true for normal spiral galaxies at about solar metallicity. If this holds true also for the high-redshift Universe, the [OIII] 88 micron line from z=6--7 star-forming galaxies, which are expected to have sub-solar metallicities, should be detectable with ALMA in a few hours of integration time. Here, we propose ALMA observations of two spectroscopically confirmed z~6--7 galaxies to make the first [OIII] measurements for objects in the reionization epoch. The measured [OIII]-to-[CII] flux ratios will also allow us to study the metallicity and other physical conditions in the interstellar medium of these high-z galaxies.',\n"," 'Exploring the nitrile and oxygen chemistry in Titans middle atmosphere. Titans atmosphere is the place of a complex coupled nitrogen-methane chemistry, producing a wealth of hydrocarbons, nitrile and other species, among which oxygen-bearing compounds produced from an external source. The middle atmosphere (50-600 km) experiences strong seasonal modifications; currently an enrichment of several nitriles (HCN, HC3N) is being observed at all latitudes by Cassini. Heavier nitriles such as HC5N, C2H3CN have been also detected, but only in the upper atmosphere (1000 km), from in situ Cassini measurements. Here we want to explore the nitrile and oxygen chemistry of Titan from band 6 measurements at 223/238 GHz in compact configuration. The goals are (i) to search for the HC5N and C2H3CN millimeter lines to determine for the first time their abundances at 150-500 km, strongly constraining photochemical models, (ii) to measure the HCCC15N(27-26) and the HC13CCN(27-26) transitions, to derive for the first time the 14N/15N isotopic ratio in HC3N, thereby exploring the probable existence of a fractionation process similar to one observed on HCN and related to isotope-selective N2 photodissociation, (iii) to search for HCCNC, the isomeric form of HC3N, expected to be present given the recent Herschel discovery of HNC in Titans atmosphere, and (iv) to search for the yet undetected oxygenated molecule H2CO, to further improve our understanding of the magnitude and nature of the oxygen external source in Titans atmosphere. The science objectives, none of which can be achieved from Cassini, will bring new insights in the understanding of Titans complex chemistry.',\n"," 'Investigating the cause of Low-Frequency Turnovers in the SEDs of SFGs: Constraining the Thermal Emission. The physical mechanisms which govern the radio emission and infrafred-radio correlation (IRRC) in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are well known but poorly understood. Radio emission from SFGs is often modelled using simple two-component power laws including thermal free-free emission and non-thermal synchrotron emission. However, recent low-frequency observations from the MWA GLEAM survey have found some SFGs exhibit much more complexity in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) including low-frequency turnovers and higher frequency kinks. These SED features are suggested to be primarily caused by free-free absorption in compact star-forming regions. A study of nearby SFGs including resolved analysis of their radio emission is therefore vital to being able to connect the physical mechanisms occuring within these galaxies to their SED features. With this understanding we will then be able to interpret the future data obtained by the SKA. We propose ALMA Band-1 and 3 observations to measure the thermal emission of a sample of 16 SFGs which includes low-frequency turnover galaxies and control galaxies to investigate the physical properties which cause differences in their SEDs.',\n"," 'The molecular cloud structure in the low-metallicity environment of 30 Doradus. Our understanding of how gas is converted into stars quickly deteriorates as the metallicity of the interstellar medium decreases. While molecular gas is commonly accepted to be the main star-forming reservoir in normal galaxies like our Milky Way, the difficulty in tracing molecules in metal-poor galaxies complicates our ability to evaluate the star-formation efficiency or even the mere importance of molecular gas in the star-formation process. We propose a detailed modeling of the photodissociation front and molecular cloud in the half-solar metallicity environment of 30Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud, in order to quantify the total molecular gas mass and the fraction of this gas that is not traced by the usual tracer CO (the CO-dark gas). Thanks to our previous modeling effort using Herschel tracers at 10pc resolution, we have identified a optimized combination of ALMA tracers that will provide the sufficient constraints to achieve our goals at 0.1pc resolution, i.e., a scale small enough to examine the transition between physical layers in molecular clouds.',\n"," 'A detailed SZ study of a massive z=1.58 merging cluster. Cluster mergers play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxy clusters. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of these dramatic events will require extending our observational window to high z, when mergers have a profound impact on the evolution of the observational and physical properties of galaxy clusters. For this reason, we propose to obtain the first high-resolution observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect in the direction of the galaxy cluster XDCP J0044.0-2033, among the most massive known merging systems ever observed at a redshift z>1.5. Through a joint SZ/X-ray analysis, we aim at performing a detailed reconstruction of the thermodynamic properties of the system, practically unexplored at this redshift and at this angular resolution. This will allow for gaining an unprecededent insights into the processes shaping galaxy clusters in the earliest phases of their formation.',\n"," 'The origin of the non-thermal emission of the peculiar transient AT2018cow. The ATLAS survey has identified the peculiar transient AT2018cow, in a disturbed spiral galaxy at 60 Mpc. This transient has a multi-component broadband spectrum: It shows a very blue continuum, indicative of a very hot thermal component, a significant emission in X-ray and millimetre wavelengths, pointing towards a relativistic event, and an emerging broad-lined type Ic supernova component, typical of gamma-ray bursts. All this together make AT2018cow a unique event that may be originated from an unknown type of stellar explosion. We propose to use ALMA, in coordination with other ground-based and space observatories to study the broadband evolution of this first-of-its-type event.',\n"," 'Resolving the kinematic structure of a [CII] emitter 800 million years after the Big Bang. We propose deep, high angular resolution band 6 observations of [CII]158mum in a normal star-forming galaxy at z~7. This galaxy was recently spectroscopically confirmed through [CII] (at low angular resolution) and it is currently the brightest known [CII] emitter in the Epoch of Reionization. With our observations we will derive the kinematics of a galaxy in a very early stage of galaxy formation and we will test if this distant system is forming its stars in a well-ordered, gas rich disk or if the source is dominated by turbulent gas motion. We will furthermore investigate the morphology of the gas and dust and determine the offsets and spatial extend of these ISM components with respect to the stars that are visible in the rest-frame UV.',\n"," 'Rotation and Proper Motion of the HH 212 Jet. Protostellar jets are believed to be launched from accretion disks around protostars, carrying away extra angular momenta from the disks, allowing material to fall onto the protostars. Their launching radius and thus model (i.e., x-wind v.s. disk-wind models) are still uncertain but can be determined from their rotation and velocity, which can be measured with ALMAs unprecedented sensitivity and resolutions. HH 212 is a nearby (400 pc) well-defined Class 0 protostellar jet in Orion. It is almost in the plane of the sky, ideal for jet rotation and proper motion (thus velocity) measurements. We have mapped it at up to ~ 0.35\" resolution with the SMA, with tentative detections of jet rotation and proper motion. Since the jet is still not resolved across the jet axis, here we propose to map it again with ALMA to resolve it at a higher angular resolution in (1) CO J=3-2 and SiO J=8-7 and (2) CO J=6-5 and SiO J=16-15, in order to confirm and resolve the jet rotation and to measure the proper motion. If confirmed, the jet rotation will be the first one detected in star formation, hugely impacting the community. Our Cycle 0 proposal was accepted to observe this jet at the same resolution as in our SMA data in order to confirm our measurements. So far no data yet. Since the jet will not be resolved in Cycle 0, here in Cycle 1, we propose to observe it at twice as high of an angular resolution in order to resolve it. We aim not only to confirm, but also to resolve the jet rotation in order to better determine the jet launching model. In particular, we aim to check if the rotation velocity increases toward the jet axis as predicted in the current models.',\n"," 'Extending SPARKS: Exploring the origin of single high-mass protostars, and rich clusters. ALMA is the only instrument to revolutionize our understanding of the early evolution of high-mass protostars, which is one of the main open issues in todays astrophysics. In our Cycle 2 project, SPARKS, we targeted a homogenous sample of 35 objects from the most massive infrared-quiet clumps selected from the ATLASGAL survey. SPARKS has been very successful reaching its science goals: we discovered the highest mass young protostars with envelope masses up to 130 AU within 2000 AU scales, and revealed excellent candidates of high-mass prestellar cores. At the same time, SPARKS revealed very intriguing fragmentation properties: single high-mass protostars with very high core formation efficiency versus typically low-mass protostars forming clusters. It is clear that now we need to understand the origin of these extrem routes of fragmentiation, and to search for more examples of these extreme fragmentation are crucial. Since the number of the most massive infrared quiet clumps in the inner Galaxy is limited, the only possible way to search for them, is to complete and extend the sample of all infrared quiet massive clumps up to 4.5 kpc from ATLASGAL.',\n"," 'Molecular line polarization in circumstellar envelopes. Although maser observations indicate magnetic fields are ubiquitous around asymptotoc giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars, their effect and origin are still unclear. It is often argued that maser observations probe locally enhanced magnetic fields. Only with ALMA will it be possible to study the magnetic field morphology in detail using thermal molecular line polarization. This will finally provide answers about the magnetic field morphology and will allow us to address the decade old debate concerning the apparent large scale field observed in OH maser regions. We propose to map the magnetic field using CO lines around two AGB stars (carbon rich IRC+10216 and oxygen rich R Leo) and the post-AGB star OH17.7-2.0 at 1\" resolution. CO polarization around IRC+10216 has previously been observed, at low resolution and sensitivity, using the SMA. However our ALMA observations will for the first time be able to resolve the actual field structure. OH17.7-2.0 has the clearest detection of a large scale field measured with OH maser to date which we will directly be able to compare with the magnetic field determined from polarized CO observations.',\n"," 'Dust nucleation in oxygen-rich envelopes of two evolved stars, VY CMa & Mira. Although dust plays a vital role in many astrochemical processes, its formation taking place around dying stars remains elusive. In particular, it is not understood how inorganic (non-carbonaceous) stardust is produced. The current nucleation theories predict that the first clusters (seeds) are formed from refractory oxides of Ti and Al, but these species remained undetected until very recently. We propose observations in which ALMA will spatially resolve the emission of TiO, TiO2, and AlO, which are the most important gas-phase species preceding the formation of seeds. The proposed observations will provide a direct view on the dust nucleation process in oxygen-rich stars. Two objects in which we have already detected the metal oxides will be observed: a red superiant, VY CMa, and an AGB star, Mira. They are prototypes of the high- and low-mass stars at the end stages of their evolution. In 6.9 h of total observing time, we will not only address the urgent questions about dust nucleation, but also shed more light on the mass-loss mechanism in late-type stars and solve some of the long standing problems about the nature of VY CMa, Mira and its companion.',\n"," 'Submillimeter Observations of a Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient. Luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) are a new class of cosmic explosions powered by active compact objects (magnetars or accreting black holes), the first new such class discovered in over a decade. Until recently, the only LFBOT with detailed multiwavelength observations was AT2018cow. AT2022tsd is the first LFBOT discovered in two years, and only the third LFBOT discovered in real time. Earlier this week, NOEMA obtained a strong detection at 280 GHz (350 GHz in the rest-frame), making this the most luminous LFBOT at submillimeter wavelengths. Submillimeter observations offer a unique diagnostic of energetic blastwaves. There is an extensive multiwavelength campaign to observe AT2022tsd across the electromagnetic spectrum, including Swift/XRT and 10-m class optical telescopes. To complement observations at lower frequencies (5-300 GHz), we request ALMA observations in Bands 6-8. The proposed ALMA observations, combined with decimeter to centimeter observations and Swift X-ray monitoring, will enable measurements of the circum-explosion density, the blastwave energy, and the microphysics of this most unusual shock.',\n"," 'SERENADE: Systematic Exploration at Reionization Epoch using Nebula And Dust Emission. ALMA has played a distinct role in z>~6 galaxy studies through its unique probe of FIR diagnostic emission lines such as [OIII]88um and [CII]158um, as well as dust continuum. The line ratio of [OIII]/[CII] is particularly informative because it reflects physical conditions of the ISM due to their different ionization potentials. Previous studies report redshift evolution of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio from z~0 to z>6 and its tentative correlations with galaxy properties, but these results are based on only less than 10 galaxies. Here we propose to conduct the first systematic program observing [OIII] and [CII] lines of 20 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z~6, where Lya is visible and easily accessible from ground-based optical instruments, and both [OIII] and [CII] can be observed with ALMA. We will 1) measure [OIII]/[CII] ratios and its correlations with various galaxy properties (e.g., SFR, bolometric luminosity, Lya equivalent width) to study ISM physics and the escape of ionizing photons at the epoch of reionization, and 2) estimate dust temperatures using multi-band continuum observations to understand nature of some high redshift galaxies with very high dust temperatures.',\n"," 'The first millimeter observations of an \"orphan\" afterglow. AT2023lcr is the best \"orphan afterglow\" candidate to date, and could be the first member of a long-hypothesized but as-yet unobserved phenomenon: either an off-axis GRB, or a low-Lorentz factor dirty fireball. Three days after the initial optical discovery, a very strong detection was found at 10 GHz with the VLA. This is the first time a candidate orphan afterglow has such stringent constraints on associated prompt gamma-ray emission and such a bright radio detection so early in its evolution. Millimeter observations offer a unique diagnostic of relativistic blastwaves, especially via detection of the reverse shock. Given the bright radio detection, this event also has the possibility to become the first \"orphan\" afterglow studied at millimeter wavelengths. To complement the ongoing campaign to observe AT2023lcr across the electromagnetic spectrum, here we request ALMA observations in Band 3. The proposed ALMA observations, combined with approved centimeter observations and ongoing X-ray monitoring, will capture the forward shock (the afterglow) and the reverse shock, thereby enabling us to determine whether AT2023lcr truly represents a new class of explosions.',\n"," 'Probing the host galaxies of QSOs in the early Universe. We propose ALMA observations of the host galaxies of 4 spectroscopically confirmed z > 6 quasars from VST ATLAS to probe the scale and star-formation levels of the associated host galaxies. By measuring the [C II] and dust continuum emission in these galaxies in the early Universe, these observations will provide invaluable data for studying the environment which facilitates the growth to high masses of SMBHs at such early times. Indeed, our sample from the VST ATLAS consists of some of the brightest known QSOs at this epoch and thus the most extreme in terms of SMBH growth in the early Universe. With these observations, we will constrain the FIR-AGN luminosity ratio, which will provide new insights into the relationship between SMBH growth and star-formation. These observations will form a basis for both a larger sample of the brightest z > 6 QSOs with the future addition of further confirmed VST ATLAS candidates, as well as a basis for future high fidelity JWST programs.',\n"," 'Study of the first O-type swollen star candidate. Swollen stars are high-mass young stellar ojbects whose stellar surface is expanding due to active accretion on to them. While this phase of massive star formation is firmly predicted by models, no clear examples of O-type stars have been identified yet in such a phase. IRAS19520+2759 is, to our knowledge, the best swollen star candidate with a luminosity > 10^5 Lsun, given its particular optical spectrum, lack of centimeter emission, its associated collimated outflow and an elongated, dense structure seen in C18O emission that is oriented perpendicular to the outflow. However, the association of the mm source and the optical source remains to be confirmed, and here we propose 0.15 arcsec angular resolution observations of the continuum at 3 mm (comparable to HSTs 0.1 arcsec resolution in the optical) in order to determine the position and morphology of the mm source. In addition, we propose simultaneous observations of dense gas tracers well detected at 3mm with single-dish, in order to search for velocity gradients indicative of rotation/infall motions.',\n"," 'H2 spin chemistry constraints from redshifted NH3 ortho and para lines. The ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of H2 is a key parameter of the spin state and chemistry of interstellar H2, which impacts interstellar chemistry in general and even gas thermodynamic properties. It is difficult to measure directly the OPR of H2 in standard conditions of the interstellar medium, but it can be indirectly retrieved using observations of OPR of other hydrides like NH3. The high frequencies of the ground state transitions of ortho- and para-NH3 makes it difficult for ground based observations of Galactic sources, but they are readily accessible with ALMA for redshifted sources, like the extragalactic absorber at z=0.89 toward the lensed quasar PKS 1830-211. Here we propose to use this unique opportunity to further investigate and measure the NH3 OPR with an accuracy of 10% or better, rivaling all previous measurements, thanks to ALMA. Our proposed NH3 OPR observations promise unequaled constraints on the chemical and physical conditions and thermal history of its environment and, ultimately, will provide new insights on both the nuclear-spin astrochemistry and properties of the interstellar medium.',\n"," 'Characterizing a Kuiper Belt analog carved out by a newly discovered brown dwarf companion. We propose to obtain the first high-resolution submillimeter map of the debris disk surrounding the nearby young F-type star HD 50571. The disk has been marginally resolved by Herschel but its radial structure remains highly uncertain. Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we have recently discovered a brown dwarf companion interior to the debris disk, making this system an ideal one to empirically study the process of gravitational sculpting of a debris disk by substellar object. This process is often used to interpret asymmeries in high-resolution images of debris disks to infer the mass and orbital properties of unseen planets. However in cases where the perturber remains undetected, significant ambiguities remain in the analysis. Thus, ALMA observations of HD 50571 now offer us a unique opportunity to test our understanding of this process and for a perturber mass that has no equivalent in the Solar System. The results of these observations will therefore inform many other studies in this field, well beyond this particular system.',\n"," 'Circumnuclear Holes around Supermassive Black Holes. Galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are likely co-evolving, and the most accepted paradigm is an evolutionary process that involves self-regulating feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent high-resolution observations of nearby galaxies are revealing ~10-100 pc CO holes at their circumnuclear regions in 20 % of the galaxy, independent of their current nuclear activity. The origin of these circumnuclear holes are unknown, but their radii typically corresponds to the SMBH potential, suggesting that the SMBHs are the cause. If these holes are developed without powerful AGN, the SMBHs must be creating these holes through heating or dynamical effects. This suggests secular effects can impede accretion of gas, making it harder for AGN accretion to occur. To unravel the cause of these circumnuclear holes, we propose to observe the HCN(1-0), CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) lines in three galaxies with known CO(2-1) holes, to probe the presence of gas and analyse the physical state of the SMBH surroundings. The results will help to clarify the origin of circumnuclear holes, and thus will reveal direct evidence of their feedback even without a luminous AGN.',\n"," 'How do high-mass protostars assemble their mass in the Central Molecular Zone?. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is a unique Galactic high-mass star forming environment, with physical conditions that are extreme compared to the Galactic disk, yet it is near enough that we can observe it on the scales of individual protostars. It is becoming clear that accretion disks play an important role in the formation of high-mass stars in the Galactic disk, but it is not known if this holds true in the CMZ, or whether the physical conditions may suppress the formation of accretion disks. Our previous ALMA observations have identified a high-mass protostar in the CMZ that is uniquely suited to investigating this question. The source is massive, young, and resides in a relatively unclustered region. It has a class II methanol maser, a bi-polar outflow, and shows signatures of rotation, providing tentative evidence for the presence of a massive disk feeding a massive protostar. We propose to observe this source down to scales of 250 AU to determine whether there is an accretion disk present, or if the formation of high-mass stars is fundamentally different in this extreme Galactic environment.',\n"," 'Establishing a timeline for the high-mass star-formation process. Studying the first stages of high-mass star formation is observationally demanding, because the entire early evolution takes place while the young stellar objects (YSOs) are embedded in their parent cloud. In recent years it has become possible to arrange high-mass star forming regions (HMSFRs) on a relative timeline. This, however, does not give any information on the actual age of individual YSOs. With the high-resolution obtainable with ALMA and (new) chemical models, one can better constrain the actual age of these objects. In cold, dense material molecules are locked onto grains, but evaporate into the gas phase at different temperatures, depending on the chemical properties of each species. When this happens their gas phase abundance increases drastically. With the continued heating by the YSO the evaporation fronts will expand making it possible to assign an age to individual YSOs, with the aid of chemical models that link the size of the evaporation region and the luminosity of the YSO to an actual age. We therefore want to observe selected molecules in HMSFRs in different evolutionary phases and compare the derived column densities with the model results.',\n"," 'Resolving the collision of supernova remnant N49 with a molecular cloud. LHA 120-N49 (N49) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the archetypical example of a supernova remnant (SNR) running into an interstellar molecular cloud. The shock manifests itself in X-rays, radio synchrotron radiation, optical and infrared fine structure lines and the heating and sputtering of dust grains, whilst the molecular cloud reveals itself by rotational emission from CO. Hence, N49 is one of the brightest SNRs in all of the Magellanic Clouds across the electromagnetic spectrum. Its position in the relatively unconfused Northern realms of the LMC lends it particularly well to a comprehensive and detailed study. One big obstacle to fully characterising the interaction is the absence of high angular and kinematic resolution images of the molecular emission. We propose to remedy this with ALMA maps of the CO and SiO emission at the collision interface at matching resolution to that of the extant multi-wavelength data. We will thus resolve the morphology, kinematics and excitation of the cloud collision and use - for the first time - SiO emission to trace the products of the sputtering of silicate grains and hence confirm the destructive nature of SNRs.',\n"," 'Heating of the quiet Sun chromosphere by two contrasting mechanisms. We propose to conduct a comprehensive search for the heating of the quiet Sun chromosphere at Bands 3 and 6 in coordination with optical, UV, EUV, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray observations. Our aim is to detect, for the first time in the same dataset, both transient bright features indicative of shocks that form as magneto-acoustic waves propagate in the chromosphere, and small-scale flare-like brightenings indicative of magnetic reconnection. The primary diagnostic to distinguish them will be their different temporal characteristics. We will compare the occurrence rates of the two types of heating events, and we will also compare their properties with those of similar events that will be detected by the instruments that will be co-observing with ALMA. These will be the first necessary steps to address the question on how often, when, and where different heating mechanisms take place.',\n"," 'ALMA Mapping of the Most Distant Galaxy Proto-Cluster Anchored by A Luminous Quasar at z=6.63. Simulations predict that luminous high-redshift quasars reside in the most massive halos and are tracers of overdensities, or proto-clusters. However, there has been no previous spectroscopic confirmation of porto-clusters associated with z>6 quasars. We recently discovered a candidate proto-cluster surrounding a z=6.63 quasar, traced by fifteen bright submm galaxies (SMGs) over a region of 4x6. With a single ALMA pointing centered on the quasar, we confirmed three galaxies at the quasar redshift by detecting [CII] lines, further suggesting this system is likely to be a proto-cluster. We propose to firmly confirm it as a proto-cluster by detecting [CII] of these SMGs with multiple ALMA pointings. Once confirmed, it will be the most distant proto-cluster yet known, and the first proto-cluster associated with a z>6 quasar. The ALMA observations will also map the star formation, measure the mass of the proto-cluster. In addition, we will perform high resolution [CII] observations and detect CO(7-6) and [CI] lines to measure the gas mass, the gas depletion time, and to constrain the excitation model of quasar host, enabling detailed studies of the assembly of this massive galaxy.',\n"," 'Submillimetre water megamaser tracers of supermassive black holes. Water megamasers are playing a crucial role in understanding AGN central engine physics, and in providing geometric distance measurements to their host galaxies for Hubble Constant determination. Although the megamasers have been well-studied at cm wavelengths (22 GHz), the scientific window for their study at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths is only just opening. Here, we propose to search the southern water megamaser galaxy NGC 4945 - already known to host water megamasers at 22, 183 and 321 GHz - for emission at nine water maser frequencies. Results of this work will inform which submm water masers are the strongest for extragalactic AGN central engine studies. In addition, it will reveal which lines are likely to be the best candidates for future mapping and distance determinations using mm/submm VLBI. The independent, purely geometric distances that could be obtained using mmVLBI can provide measurements of the Hubble Constant and black hole masses accurate to a few percent, of fundamental importance to cosmology and the understanding of AGN physics.',\n"," 'Lifting the Curtain in M87: From Accretion to Jet Formation. Understanding the processes of mass accretion and jet-launching in supermassive black holes (SMBH) is one of the central quests in modern astrophysics. The radio galaxy M87 contains the nearest and largest active SMBH, offering the best opportunity for probing the site of mass accretion and jet launching near a SMBH. Here we propose polarization imaging of M87 at 86 GHz with 7 Rs resolution, to determine the strength and topology of the magnetic field, detect the accretion flow and discriminate between two major jet launching scenarios (Blandford & Payne (BP) or Blandford & Znajek (BZ)). In combination with near-in-time space-VLBI imaging at 22 GHz (RadioAstron) and planned 230 GHz VLBI imaging (EHT), we aim to determine the frequency dependence of the polarization vectors, which in turn will allow us to determine the intrinsic B-field, corrected for Faraday rotation effects. Additional science goals are (i) the determination of the slope of the jet collimation profile, and (ii) the magnetization of flow and jet. The accurate measurement of the collimation profile will allow us to prove/disprove the reality of electromagnetic jet launching in M87 and help to determine the BH spin.',\n"," 'Warm and Dense Molecular Gas in Local Merging ULIRGs. Hierarchical galaxy formation scenario predicts that galaxy-galaxy interaction and merger are the fundamental process that govern the evolution of galaxies in the universe, changing the galaxy morphology and triggering intense starbursts and/or AGN activity. Recent high resolution simulations have shown that tidal interaction is responsible for forming massive clumps of dense gas surrounded by diffuse gas clouds and triggering star formation across the galaxy disks. An observational test of gas response requires mapping both the diffuse and dense gas tracers in merging U/LIRGs at high spatial resolution. Here we propose a systematic CO(3-2), HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3) survey of 6 of the brightest merging ULIRGs in the local universe at 0.3 arcsec (200 pc) resolution of ALMA Band 7. The primary aim of this study is to map the distribution and kinematics of warm/dense molecular gas and the dense gas mass fraction and interpret their relation to star formation and AGN activities in the context of the merger-induced response of the ISM in the progenitor disks.',\n"," 'Toward Understanding the Misalignment of Outflow and Jet from Protostars: Observation of the Warped Disk. The goal of this proposal is to understand the formation of the disk associated with the outflow and jet driving during the main accretion phase. For this purpose, we propose the observation of the disk/envelope and molecular outflow/jet in 5 line emissions: C18O J = 3-2, CS J = 7-6, HCO+ J = 5-6, CO J = 3-2 and SiO J = 8-7 and 0.9 mm continuum. Our target is the Class 0 object, MMS 5, which shows misalignment outflows and jets direction, at the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3). MMS 5/OMC-3 is the only object of detecting both outflow and jet, and misalignment of these direction with ~1,000 year after protostar formation or outflow/jet driving. Since the MMS 5/OMC-3 is extremely young, the only case is that the size of the jet is shorter than that of outflow. Our high-resolution and higher excitation observation results will reveal the warped disk structure, Keplarian rotation disk and inner jet structure within 20 au scale. Moreover, requested observed lines can trace infalling envelope and disk, and the jet close to the central source. Therefore, our proposal is important to understand the mass ejection, mass accretion and disk formation mechanism in protostar forming early phase.',\n"," 'Using Hydrogen Recombination-line Masers to Trace Disk and Wind Dynamics in MWC 349A. Disk winds are thought to play a critical role in star birth. As winds extract excess angular momentum from accretion disks, matter in the disk can be transported inward to the star to fuel mass growth. However, the observational evidence of wind carrying angular momentum has been very limited. We propose ALMA observations of a rare hydrogen recombination-line maser object MWC349A. The high signal-to-noise ratios made possible by the maser emission process and high spectral dynamic range of ALMA allow us to constrain the relative astrometry of the maser spots to 0.1 milli-arcsecond precision. By improving relative astrometry by one order of magnitude over the previous SMA and PdBI studies, this project will determine how angular momentum is transfered to the wind within a radius of 25 AU, and inform theoretical models of jets and outflows.',\n"," 'Characterizing the solar nebula analog MP Mus. The number of nearby, primordial circumstellar disks is very small, which significantly limits our current understanding of their evolution. We propose to observe the evolved disk around the nearby (100 pc) solar analog MP Mus, a source very similar to the famous TW Hya disk that is still mostly unexplored. Despite its age (8-15 Myr), MP Mus is surrounded by a gas and dust rich disk that may have a large cavity, as suggested by its SED and previous coronagraphic observations. We propose to perform a comprehensive characterization of this target with spatially resolved observations of its dust continuum emission at bands 7 and 4, together with 12CO(3-2) and 13CO(3-2) observations. These data will: 1) reveal the dust distribution of the disk around MP Mus and unambiguously identify the presence of a cavity, 2) probe dust growth and migration at different locations in the disk, 3) determine the gas distribution and mass, and 4) accurately estimate its gas-to-dust ratio. The proximity, age, and characteristics of MP Mus make it a perfect laboratory to better understand disk evolution and planet formation.',\n"," 'Exploring Dust Evolution and Sub-structure Formation in an Infant Disk around a Class 0 Protostar. Now it is well known that various substructures are formed in PPDs. However, their origin is still controversial. For instance, it is still unclear whether ring structures really mean planet formation. It is thus important to examine when and where dust coagulation and settlement starts during the disk evolution. In general, disks are not in hydrostatic-equilibrium (HE) in their early stages. Nevertheless, the infant disk in L1527 has a doubly flared structure, which can be regarded as a sign of the transition to HE. In this disk, dust growth and substructure formation has already started. Furthermore, the low alpha index (~1.6) and the asymmetry only seen in the central part (r<10 au) may suggest self-scattering, substructure formation, or existence of dark lane. To understand their origin and the change in the alpha index at the boundary of the inner and outer disks (r~50 au), we propose multi-band continuum observations. By combining the available Band 3 and 7 data with the Band 4 and 6 data, we will address the above questions. The origin of the asymmetry and the low alpha index will be explored by the Band 7 observation at a 3 au resolution.',\n"," 'Molecular line flux ratios and buried AGNs in merging ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Scrutinizing deeply buried AGNs in merging dust/gas-rich ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) is crucial to understand how supermassive black holes grow in mass in the universe, but has been hampered by large dust extinction. Observations at the almost dust-extinction-free (sub)millimeter wavelength can be a powerful tool, because an AGN and a starburst should produce different (sub)millimeter molecular rotational J-transition line flux ratios through different physical/chemical effects. We propose 0.1-0.2\" resolution HCN and HCO+ J=4-3 and J=2-1 line observations of ULIRGs which show elevated millimeter HCN J=3-2 emission at the nuclei where putative luminous buried AGNs are expected to reside. We aim to distinguish, based on multiple J-transition HCN and HCO+ data, whether the elevated nuclear HCN emission is due to (1) HCN abundance enhancement by AGN radiation/mechanical effects and/or (2) simply higher HCN excitation by dense and warm nuclear molecular gas. If we confirm that the first mechanism is primarily responsible, the enhanced HCN emission will be an even more solid indicator of luminous buried AGNs in the nearby and distant ULIRG population.',\n"," 'Multiplicity of brown dwarfs at the earliest evolutionary stages. The multiplicity properties of brown dwarfs (BDs) have been studied in the field and in star forming regions: BDs are normally found in tight binaries (sep < 20 au) with mass ratii close to 1. Are they born with these properties or/and are they the result of their evolution? To shed light on this topic, here we propose band 7 ALMA observations of 5 Class 0 proto-BDs, that is, BDs at the earliest stages of their evolution when they are still deeply embedded in their parental cloud. The main goal is to search for companions and compare the proto-BD binary properties with those reported in more evolved BDs. Note that non-detections will also help to put constraints on the binary frequency, separation range and mass ratio. The results will be compared with predictions from different models of BD formation, to check which of them can reproduce the observed properties.',\n"," 'Widespread SiO in IRDCs: Cloud-Cloud Collision Formation of Molecular Cloud Filaments?. Infrared-Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are filamentary molecular clouds believed to represent the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the filamentary structures observed for these clouds: shock-induced formation, flow-driven formation, cloud-cloud collisions ad magnetically-regulated formation. Among them, the cloud-cloud collision scenario predicts that already molecular clouds collide at velocities of some km s-1, yielding cold and filamentary IRDC structures. As a result, relics of the initial cloud-cloud interaction are expected. Recent single-dish high-sensitivity mapping of the SiO (2-1) line toward two quiescent IRDCs (Clouds H and G) shows that this emission is widespread over parsec-scales across both clouds. Here, we propose to image the emission of SiO (2-1) toward Clouds H and G to clearly establish whether this emission arises from the possible inter-shocked layer originated in the initial cloud-cloud collision, or whether widespread SiO is associated with a population of low-mass protostars that remain deeply embedded and undetected at all wavelengths toward these clouds.',\n"," 'Arp 220 Nuclear Disks at 50 mas Resolution. We propose ultra-high resolution (50uas, 20pc) imaging of Arp 220, the closest, brightest and best studied ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG). Our observations in the CO(1-0), (2-1) and (3-2), HCN(4-3), CS(7-6),(5-4) and (2-1) (all with their 13C isotopologues) and the dust continuum will resolve the gas structures and dynamics in the two (hypothesized) nuclear disks of this archetypical ULIRG. The observations will also place significant constraints on possible SMBHs. Indeed, our cycle 1 observations of Arp220 (Scoville et al. 2015), together with our extensive simulations, demonstrate that such extremely high fidelity observations are feasible, that will result in resolutions that exceed previous ULIRG observations by orders of magnitudes in beam area. Tracing a number of key diagnostic lines of the ISM will shed unprecedented insights in the inner workings of this prototypical ULIRG (gas densities, masses, outflows, gas dispersions), that hosts some of the most extreme star formation environments in the universe, both at low and high redshifts. Compact and extended configurations are requested to provide the required image fidelity at the superlative resolution of ALMA.',\n"," 'Confirming a z~6.9 Sub-mm Galaxy in COSMOS Hosting a Radio-Loud AGN. We propose Band 6 observations to confirm the redshift of a dusty, massive z~6.9 galaxy identified over the COSMOS field that shows multiple signatures of hosting a radio-loud AGN. We will employ a [CII]158mum scanning strategy has proven to be highly successful at spectroscopically detecting massive reionization-era galaxies with ALMA. Upon confirmation, this source will be not only the highest-redshift radio-loud galaxy yet discovered, but also the highest-redshift unlensed sub-mm galaxy (L_IR ~ 3e13 L_sol). Because this galaxy was selected over a relatively small field, confirming its high-redshift nature would suggest that radio-loud (non-quasar) AGN may be a significant accretion mode for supermassive black hole formation, helping understand how these objects formed so rapidly in the early Universe. Our observations will simultaneously provide morphological and kinematic maps of the gas and dust within this highly obscured system, constraints on its small-scale environment via serendipitous [CII] detections from ~50x lower-mass neighboring sources, and improved insight into contribution of dusty galaxies to the cosmic star formation rate budget at z>6.',\n"," 'Mira. The first AGB star in a triple system ?. Binary/multiple stellar systems, which are as abundant as single stars, are very interesting cosmic laboratories as they are related to many astrophysical phenomena. In the case of AGB (and post-AGB) stars, they are the most likely explanation for the shaping of non spherical PNe, a long standing problem. While many binaries are known in PNe, there are few examples in the previous AGB phase. Hydro models are available, but known orbital parameters for AGB binares are almost nonexistent. We propose to observe the closest bona fide binary with an AGB primary, Mira. The system is well studied and there are many indications that the system is in fact triple, and that the yet unseen component, Mira C, is strongly interacting with the AGB primary Mira A, affecting its pulsation and its mass loss. We claim that this third component is tentatively detected in public data from project 2017.1.00393.S, and we propose to perform a deeper integration in ALMA band 6, with 23 mas HPBW, in order to confirm this. At the same time we will also improve the values for the Mira AB orbit, obtain its mass ratio, and take a close look at how this triple system is shaping the AGB wind from Mira A.',\n"," 'Unveiling the ISM properties of a mature spectroscopically-confirmed lensed galaxy at z=9.1. The formation and early evolution of the first galaxies remains an outstanding quest in modern astronomy. In ALMA Cycle 4, our team spectroscopically confirmed a z=9.1096 gravitationally-lensed galaxy via [OIII] 88 micron emission in Band 7. Concurrently, deep X-shooter observations revealed Lyman alpha emission blueshifted by 450 km/s, suggesting this object is located in a large ionized bubble. The most exciting aspect which merits urgent follow-up observations is the prominent Balmer discontinuity seen in this, the most distant known ALMA source, which indicates the bulk of its stars may have formed as early as redshift z=15. We thus propose to exploit the newly-available Band 5 to determine the strength of [CII] 158 micron emission, thereby determining the gas phase metallicity of this mature system as well as the systemic redshift for future ALMA studies of further diagnostic lines.',\n"," 'Systematically Measuring CO Emission of Double-Barred Galaxies. We propose to initiate a systematic and reliable study on molecular gas in double-barred galaxies. The inner bar in double-barred galaxies is one of the mechanisms to drive gas inflow to fuel active galactic nuclei. However, it is still unclear whether and how much gas is needed to maintain a long-lived inner bar. Previous studies were unable to provide reliable results due to the difficulty to identify true double-barred galaxies and inadequate sensitivity and spatial resolution to measure the gas mass in the entire galaxy as well as in the inner bar region. To remedy this situation, we propose to obtain the CO line emission of ten double-barred galaxies which have been confirmed to have a unique feature in the stellar kinematics called sigma-hollows. This feature identifies them as true double-barred galaxies. Using these ALMA observations, we will be able to provide reliable constraints of the gas mass on theories to shed light on the formation of double-barred galaxies. Our data will also provide important information for future studies to investigate the gas properties in double-barred galaxies, such as the gas inflow rate, which require higher spatial and velocity resolution.',\n"," 'Outflows and infalling profiles in compact clumps: high-mass star formation in the Southern Outer Galaxy. We propose ALMA band 7 observations of 9 compact clumps in the outer Galaxy, associated with bipolar molecular outflows, at distances between 2 and 8 kpc. The sources are identified in our sample of HiGAL compact sources, and associated dense gas detected in CS(2-1). The sources present signposts of high-mass star formation in advanced evolutionary stages (massive young stellar objects and UCHII regions). Outflow emission was identified with APEX-2 observations at a resolution of 19\", and additional SiO observations at 217 GHz confirm the presence of shocked gas. We aim to characterise the outflow emission and velocity gradients of infalling material in spectra profiles at resolutions of 1.1 arcsec, up to 19 arcsec. The results will be compared with our previous ALMA results in the young molecular outflow / hot core G331.512-0.103. The proposed targets are among the most luminous sources found outside the solar circle, and constitute an unique laboratory for the study of complex molecules in the outskirt of the Galaxy.',\n"," 'From Hydrocarbons to Dust in Protoplanetary Nebulae. We propose to observe two carbon-rich protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe), CRL 618 and CRL 2688, to investigate the physical and chemical conditions that lead to complex hydrocarbon chemistry in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars after the AGB phase. These two transition objects are characterized by a different temperature, hence UV field, of the central star. Polyacetylenes and cyanopolyynes have been detected in both sources but benzene, the first aromatic ring, is only seen in CRL 618. Emission from carbon dust of mixed aromatic/aliphatic composition is only seen in CRL 2688. For both molecules and grains, UV-processing was invoked as a key process in driving the chemical evolution. We aim to reconcile these observational facts and get new insights into the gas and dust chemistry.The physical and chemical conditions are retrieved from studying HCCCN, CCH, HCN, CN, and CO. For CRL 618 we also observe HCO+ and a recombination line of Hydrogen to characterise its compact photodissociation region (PDR). Only with ALMA can we accurately probe the densest, smallest regions (at scales of 0.2 to ~1\") where the most active chemistry is expected.',\n"," 'M-Type Asteroids: The Remnant Core Fragments of Differentiated Planetesimals?. Remnants of large planetesimals that were collisionally fragmented early in the Solar Systems history remain today in the form of asteroids, providing a window into the early stages of planet formation. The class of high-density M-type asteroids have historically been thought to represent portions of the metallic cores of large, differentiated planetesimals. However, efforts to characterize their surface compositions have produced contradictory results; while radar albedos and thermal inertias indicate the smooth, dense surfaces expected for metallic compositions, spectroscopic features reveal the presence of silicates and even hydrated minerals. The linear polarization of thermal emission from a solid body is set by the dielectric constant and thus sensitive to the metal content of the surface, providing a new and powerful means for addressing the question of asteroid surface metallicity. We propose to map the continuum polarization of three asteroids that span purported compositions ranging from stony to metallic, in order to characterize the composition and metal content of the surfaces of M-type asteroids.',\n"," 'Compaction in Obscured AGN Hosts. The processes driving the co-evolution of galaxies and their super-massive black holes largely remain a debated issue in extragalactic astrophysics. Using HST imaging, we found that the radial I-band light profile of obscured AGN host galaxies at z~1 is more compact than that of star-forming sources at similar redshift and stellar mass, and that it is not due to the contribution of a passive stellar component. It could thus pinpoint an increased activity of central star formation possibly triggered by a phase of gas compaction. Indeed such AGN hosts are actively forming stars, but where this star formation occurs is still unconstrained. We thus request high-resolution ALMA Band 7 images to derive dust emission maps of 10 obscured AGN hosts. This will allow us constraining their star formation surface density without AGN contamination, and investigating if the spatial distribution of young stars follows that of the compact visible disk. We will address whether the obscured black hole accretion phase is related to galaxies experiencing a compaction of their gaseous component, which could play a key role in the final quenching mechanisms driving the formation of passive red sources.',\n"," 'The lensed quasar SDSSJ0924+0219: a unique flux anomaly. Quasars lensed by foreground galaxies are important because they allow us to measure microlensing effects caused by stars in the lens galaxy, and millilensing effects caused by 10^6 - 10^7 M(sun) CDM structures in the lens. Both effects cause flux anomalies, ratios of the lensed quasar images which cannot be explained by smooth lens models. SDSS~J0924+0219, in the optical, has one of the most drastic flux anomalies known in a lensed quasar, previously ascribed to microlensing: however, the anomalys persistence suggests that it may be due to CDM substructures in the lens. To definitively test this, we require observations at a wavelength where the background source is large enough to be immune from microlensing: ambiguity in cm-radio means that ALMA is the unique instrument which can do this, in a very small investment of time.',\n"," 'An ACA N+ survey of z=3-7 DSFGs from the South Pole Telescope survey. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) has detected at 1.4mm, ~100 bright (lensed), high redshift star forming galaxies from a 2500 degree^2 survey, with APEX/LABOCA and Herschel/SPIRE followup. For an unbiased subsample of 57 sources, we now have CO and [CII]-derived redshifts from ALMA Band-3 spectral scans, and APEX [CII] followup. We propose to measure the [NII] line in all 42 of these DSFGs lying at z>3, which have their [CII] lines measured (or being measured) by APEX, and can be reached in ALMA bands 6 or 7. These observations optimally use the ACA to get total flux N+ measurements for precision line ratios, and will provide a legacy database of the evolving distribution of C+/N+ from z=3-7 in a well characterized and unbiased sample of lensed DSFGs.',\n"," 'Resolving multiple ring structures in protoplanetary disks. We propose to obtain line and continuum observations of two protoplanetary disks, J1615 and HD97048, that show multiple rings in our high angular resolution optical scattered light images. We aim to understand the origin of these rings by resolving these regions with ALMA at a similar angular resolution (~0.06\"). By comparing the observations that on one hand, trace micron-sized particles (SPHERE/VLT) and on the other hand, probe mm-sized grains (ALMA), we will establish whether these rings are particle traps. We will determine the 3D geometry of the disks, which we expect to be strongly affected by planet-disk interaction, in particular in the case of J1615 for which we detected a planetary companion candidate. We will also constrain, through dust evolution models, the efficiency of dust trapping which is related to the strength of the turbulence in the disk.',\n"," 'Uncovering the gas reservoirs of absorption-selected galaxies. Decades of research using absorption-line techniques have characterized the physical properties of neutral gas in the Universe, and established a link between absorbers and galaxies. However, efforts to identify the absorbing galaxies themselves have been stymied by insufficient sensitivity and/or spatial resolution. We propose to use the ALMA Band-3 and Band-4 receivers to search for redshifted CO(1-0) or CO(2-1) emission from four high-metallicity, damped Lyman-alpha absorbers at z<1, the best current candidates for a search for CO emission. The proposed observations will allow us to (1) obtain the first detections of molecular emission in damped systems, (2) derive the star formation efficiency in the absorbers, by comparing the SFR with the molecular gas mass, and (3) compare the gas dynamics revealed through metal-line absorption, H-alpha nebular emission and CO molecular emission. This pilot program will establish whether deep sub-mm observations may provide mass, size, and dynamical constraints for high-z galaxies detected in absorption. This would represent the first, critical step to resolving the physical connections between HI gas in absorption and modern galaxies.',\n"," 'Identifying the Host and Physics of an Unknown Extragalactic Emission Line. We have discovered a population of emission lines in a blind spectroscopic survey that have no clear optical counterparts, lie at an unknown redshift, and arise from an unknown atom or molecule. The unknown lines were identified in the ALFALFA HI 21 cm survey, but they are neither 21 cm HI nor 18 cm OH megamasers. We propose an ALMA CO line scan of the brightest emitter. The primary objective is to obtain a redshift, detect mm continuum, and to associate the line with an optical counterpart. The lines are almost certainly non-thermal and represent a new molecular or atomic emission process observable at cosmological distances. One possibility is very high redshift hydrogen recombination line masers (theoretically predicted), but molecular masers associated with extreme starbursts or dusty AGN seem more likely. In order to uncover the nature of these mysterious emission lines, we request 3.7 hours of 12 m time to scan Bands 3 and 4 to obtain a CO redshift. Only ALMA offers the sensitivity and angular resolution needed to solve this mystery. Whatever these lines and their hosts turn out to be, ALMA will open new discovery space and reveal new astrophysical phenomena.',\n"," 'A Protoplanet Interacting with an Edge-on Circumstellar Disk. We have discovered a companion to a very young star using HST. The object is projected at the outer radius of an edge-on protoplanetary disk and appears coplanar with the disk. Keck AO photometry indicates the object has the same temperature as brown dwarf GQ Lupi B but with 10x less luminosity - consistent with a planetary mass object. Keck AO spectroscopy detects 2.12 micron H2 emission from the companion, confirming its youth and excluding a background object. We propose band 6 continuum and CO isotopologue observations to 1) measure spatial and velocity asymmetries in the outer disk and show that the gas there is moving in a two-body potential; 2) detect a separate disk around the companion; 3) use disk rotation curve(s) to derive the mass of the component(s); and 4) resolve the disk vertical structure. With a substellar spectral energy distribution, accretion signatures (the subject of a pending HST proposal), and the demonstration of gravitational interaction with disk gas, this object would be established as the leading example of an accreting protoplanet at 100 AU and offer support to models of planet formation by gravitational instability.',\n"," 'Chemistry in Feedback Environments in the Early Universe. Feedback is thought to be one of the main processes regulating star formation in its peak phase throughout the history of the universe. We here propose to use the key oxygen hydrides, OH+, H2O+, and H3O+, to probe the molecular ion chemistry associated with outflowing and infalling gas vs. material found at the active sites of star formation in four z>2.5 starbursts. Based on state-of-the art chemical modeling, we will measure abundances and column densities, as is critical to calculate mass/momentum outflow/infall rates and the local physical conditions in the absorbing layers. We will also study variations in the gas density in gas flows vs. systemic gas components, molecular fractions, and fractional ionization. We will link these findings to the star formation rates and their surface densities to search for spatially-resolved correlations. These measurements will be key to understand the nature of the turbulent gas entailed in the large-scale outflows and infall associated with massive galaxies in the early universe in their peak starburst phase, and how they impact the resulting stellar population seen in their present-day counterparts at the end of the mass buildup process.',\n"," 'Properties of the most distant star-forming GMC in the Milky Way. The properties of molecular clouds and star formation are expected to be subject to Galaxy-scale variations. In the Outer Galaxy, the importance of the spiral structure is thought to be diminished, with a metallicity gradient observed with galactocentric radius. Despite the importance of location in determining the outcome(s) of the ISM life-cycle, these effects are poorly understood. This leaves extrapolation from our current understanding to molecular cloud and star formation properties in even nearby galaxies uncertain, let alone to the conditions under which the bulk of stars in the Universe formed. We propose to comprehensively map and characterise the molecular gas and dust in the most distant star forming region found to date within our Galaxy, where the metallicity is expected to be significantly below that in the Inner Galaxy and supernovae may be more important than spiral arms. With these data, we will constrain the cloud properties (e.g. clump mass efficiency, column density PDF) at comparable resolution to single-dish observations of nearby star forming regions, thus providing the first step in bridging the gap between the Inner Galaxy and the nearby universe.',\n"," 'Molecular Gasdynamics in the Central Elliptical Galaxy of the NGC 5044 Cool-Core Group. The central elliptical galaxies of cool-core groups and clusters rank among the most molecular-gas-rich galaxies in the Local Universe. Such groups/clusters exhibit a strong central peak in their X-ray emission, indicating intensive cooling of the X-ray gas in the group/cluster core. In the absence of sufficient reheating by radio jets from their central galaxies, the gas in the group/cluster core should cool below X-ray temperatures and flow inwards (an X-ray cooing flow), thus depositing atomic and molecular gas in the central galaxy. In the only such galaxy so far mapped in CO, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster, the molecular gas is distributed in radially-infalling filaments indicative of an X-ray cooling flow. Such molecular structures have not previously been observed in any other galaxy, and call to attention an important galactic-scale phenomenon yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we propose to image the molecular gas in the central elliptical galaxy of a cool-core group, NGC 5044. Unlike the Perseus cluster where the X-ray gas is reheated by a powerful AGN outburst from its central galaxy, in the NGC 5044 group gas reheating occurs through the cumulative effects of many weak AGN outbursts from its central galaxy as is more characteristic of cool-core groups/clusters. Our goals are to determine where the molecular gas in NGC 5044 is being deposited or dragged outwards, and through comparisons with the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster gain insights not possible from studies of one system or environment alone.',\n"," 'Determining the Physical State of Two Massive, Dynamically Ambiguous Galaxy Clusters. Galaxy clusters are vital probes of cosmology. Much progress has been made with the simple assumptions that they are relaxed and spherically symmetric, but high angular resolution X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM over the past decade and a half have revealed that clusters show a variety of deviations from this simple concept of equilibrium. More recently high angular resolution SZE observations have emerged as a powerful and complementary technique. In several cases high-resolution (~10\") SZE observations have identified very hot, 100-kpc scale regions of very well studied clusters which had previously been missed by modern X-ray observations. It is important to observationally quantify the prevalance and character of these disturbances to have a complete & accurate picture of galaxy clusters. MUSTANG SZ observations of Abell 611 and MACSJ1206-0847 showed low- to medium-significance hints of 100-kpc scale hot gas. These clusters also showed a mix of other dynamical markers. We propose here to conclusively unveil & characterize these features with 5\" - 10\" resolution, targeted SZE imaging using ALMA Band 3.',\n"," 'In search of the high HCN/HCO+ ratio origin in AGNs: SiO imagings of Seyfert galaxies down to 15-30 pc scales. The origin of HCN enhancement in AGNs, which can be seen in high HCN/HCO+ ratio, is still far from well understood. Now ALMA reveals much higher HCN/HCO+ ratios found in the circumnuclear disks (CNDs) rather than the exact AGN positions, which raises a scenario that HCN is enhanced by mechanical heating such as shock of jet/outflow from AGNs (MH scenario). The immediate objective is thus to verify the MH scenario by revealing the distribution of shocked gas at high spatial resolution down to sub-CND scale. Here we propose unprecedented 15-30 pc resolution imagings of SiO J=6-5 line, a good shock tracer, toward the two distinct CNDs of nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 and NGC 1097. We aim to achieve the following science goals, which will be observational evidence to verify the MH scenario: 1. Do SiO and HCN arise from the same regions in the CNDs? --- We will confirm whether the distribution of SiO and HCN have spatial correlation or not, regardless of AGN activities of these galaxies. 2. If so, are SiO and HCN really enhanced? --- We will then compare SiO/H13CO+ and H13CN/H13CO+ ratios to confirm whether these are enhanced at the same region found the above science goal.',\n"," 'Magnetic field structure at the onset of high-mass star formation. It is strongly debated which physical processes dominate the initial fragmentation and collapse at the onset of star formation, and how much gravity, turbulence and/or magnetic fields contribute. While pre-ALMA magnetic field studies were limited to large spatial scales or low sensitivities, ALMA for the first time offers the opportunity to study weaker polarization signals during the earliest evolutionary stages at high spatial resolution. Therefore, we propose to investigate one well-studied infrared dark cloud (dark at 70 & 100mum) IRDC18310-4 where the turbulent properties are known from previous observations. These ALMA polarization data will reveal the magnetic field structure and strength in the plane of the sky, as well as its derivatives, i.e., the mass-to-flux-ratio and the turbulent to magnetic energy ratio. These parameters are crucial to characterize the stability and differentiate the importance between turbulence and magnetic field. We stress that this will be to the authors knowledge the first high-resolution magnetic field study at the onset of high-mass star formation and hence serve as a template for future more statistical studies of larger samples.',\n"," 'High-resolution observations of a resolved AGN-SMG normal, main-sequence merger at z 5. We propose deep, high-spatial and spectral resolution, Band 7 [CII] observations of a unique merger between a quasar and a sub-millimeter galaxy at z=4.68. The observations will allow us to determine the dynamical state of the two colliding galaxies and map the [CII] associated to the merging galaxies and debris surrounding material, including a spectacular 20 kpc tidal tail. We will determine what is the impact of the merger event on the host galaxies and study regions of enhanced [CII] emission. We will also compare the physical conditions of the gas and dust to those observed in local systems. Finally, we want to complement the [CII] observations with a low resolution, Band 6 exploration of the [NII] line in view of possible future ALMA follow up of this line.',\n"," 'Characterizing multiple polarization mechanisms in the bright, inclined disk of IM Lup. This is a follow-up of our successful Cycle 4 ALMA polarization observations of the large, bright, inclined protoplanetary disk IM Lup. Our Band 7 observations, published in Hull et al. (2018), show a polarization morphology consistent with dust scattering. Here we propose to observe IM Lup in both Band 3 and Band 6 in order to characterize the polarization at longer wavelengths. The results in HL Tau by Stephens et al. (2017) show radiative alignment dominating at Band 3; scattering at Band 7; and a superposition of the two at Band 6. We aim to test whether the transition from scattering to radiative alignment is the same for an optically thinner and significantly more evolved Class II source like IM Lup.',\n"," 'Corona Australis Disk Zoo. The well clustered young stellar objects (YSOs) concentrated to the nearby (130 pc) molecular hub-filament system, Corona Australis (CrA), are by far the least explored by millimeter interferometry owing to the -37 deg Decl. Their wide ranges in disk initial conditions, ambient environments, and evolutionary pathways are ultimately linked to a diversity of planetary systems. The proximity of CrA now permits taking full advantage of ALMAs imaging capability to survey a large number of YSOs with good sensitivity and spatial resolution. We propose to resolve the gas and dust content of all 43 known protoplanetary (Class II) disks in this region with a ~0\".24 (30 AU) beam. We will make impact to the community by revealing fundamental disk properties including the dust/gas density profile, morphology (cavity, azimuthal asymmetry, and multiplicity), and gas motions including rotation, radial flows, and jet/outflow, in great details. These statistically significant, unbiased and homogeneous disk samples will achieve a mass sensitivity to 0.1 Jupiter massse in dust, and ~<0.3 Jupiter masses in 13CO/C18O line ratio, which will define a realistic parameter space for planet formation models.',\n"," 'Physical and Chemical Transition from the Envelope to the Disk in the Hot Corino Source IRAS 16293-2422. IRAS 16293-2422 is a well-studied Class 0 protostar, and is known as a typical hot corino harboring rich complex organic molecules (COMs) such as HCOOCH3. We have recently found an infalling-rotating envelope (IRE) in Source A of this source by analyzing the ALMA Cycle 1 archival data, and identified its centrifugal barrier with the aid of a simple ballistic model. A drastic chemical change is also found in this source: OCS traces the IRE, and CH3OH the centrifugal barrier, and H2CS the entire region from the envelope to the inner disk component. The Keplerian disk component is suggested by the high velocity component of the H2CS lines. However, the Keplerian rotation is not confirmed on the basis of the kinematic structure because of the limited resolution. To overcome this situation, we here propose higher angular resolution (0\".07) observations to characterize the structure and dynamics of the Keplerian disk and the transition zone from the IRE to the Keplerian disk. These observations will address a long standing question how the disk structure is formed and what the hot corino is. Thus these observations have a substantial impact in astrochemistry and astrophysics.',\n"," 'A survey of deuterium chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Protoplanetary disks links protostars and Solar System bodies physically and chemically. Deuterium fractionation is one of the most common tools to probe how these different stages are connected. Deuterium fractionation in molecules can for example be used to infer the importance of cold chemistry for different volatiles in the Solar System, including the Earths sea water. The utility of deuterium fractionation as a probe is currently limited, however, by few, and seemingly contradictory observational constraints on the deuterium chemistry in disks; the spatially resolved fractionation pattern seems radically different both between molecules and between the two most well-studied disks, TW Hya and hD 163296. We propose to carry out a modest (6 source) survey of deuterium fractionation in disks that span a range of stellar and disk characteristics to explore (1), the variability in deuterium-enrichments during planet formation, and (2), the link between this variability and disk structures, ages, and impinging radiation fields. This would provide the strongest constraints to date on how the deuterium chemistry evolves between the protostellar stage and the mature Solar System.',\n"," 'Probing low-mass star formation in the CMZ in Sgr B2 Deep South. Star formation in the Galactic center is lower than expected given the high mass of dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ). The physical conditions required to drive star formation are therefore clearly different in the CMZ than in the local Galactic disk: overall gas temperature, pressure, and density are much higher. We propose a survey of the only known region of ongoing, widespread star formation in the CMZ, Sgr B2 Deep South (DS). Sgr B2 DS is part of the broader Sgr B2 cloud, but unlike the famous cluster-forming sources Sgr B2 M and N, DS has an extended filament containing hundreds of star-forming cores. We will measure the masses of pre- and protostellar cores down to 0.3 solar masses, deep enough to measure the turnover point of the core mass function. This measurement will provide the best sample for quantitative comparison between Galactic disk and CMZ star formation, thereby establishing an empirical foothold for extrapolation to more extreme conditions in other galaxies.',\n"," 'The parsec scale view of the starburst ISM through molecular diagnostics. Extreme activities in starburst galaxies have a direct impact on their molecular interstellar medium (ISM). These effects on the ISM are most prominent in the vicinity of young stellar clusters on parsec-scales, dominated by feedback in the form of heating and outflows. Thanks to its proximity and brightness, the starburst galaxy NGC 253 allows for the most detailed studies of the ISM in a starburst environment using (sub-)millimeter molecular lines. These lines are an effective probe due to their large penetration depth. Using measurements of a variety of molecular diagnostics, we will study the molecular cloud physical properties, the chemical composition caused by various heating sources, extreme excitation conditions, and cluster-scale outflows. We intend to perform a spectral scan in Bands 6 & 7 with 0.2\" resolution in the central 15\" of NGC 253 to cover all transitions of interest. Short spacing information is already available from our Cycle 5 project. Our spectral scan will efficiently reveal the highly excited physical conditions and signatures of feedback in the nearest starburst galaxy NGC 253.',\n"," 'Water and Organic Molecules in Yound Bursting Object. We propose to observe the transition lines of water and organic molecules at ALMA band 7 towards a protoplanetary disk around young bursting object, FU Ori. FU Ori type burst is thought to be important in terms of thermal history of materials in planetary systems, including our Solar system. The burst phenomena affect the location of water snowline, distribution of water-containing solid materials, and also composition of organic molecules in the disk. Our chemical reaction network calculations together with line radiative transfer calculations, based on the detailed physical model of the disk, suggests that the proposed H2O lines are suitable to locate the water snowline in the disk (Notsu et al. 2018). By analyzing the line profile under an assumption of Keplerian motion, we will be able to locate the snowline spectroscopically even without spatially resolving the line emitting region. Meanwhile, many complex organic molecular lines have been detected towards FU Ori type objects recently. Our proposed observations of complex organic molecules together with the H2O lines give us information on organic molecule formation around the water snowline.',\n"," 'Ghost vs. Zombie Gas: Determining the Primordial vs. Secondary Origin of CO in Evolved Circumstellar Disks. The sensitivity of ALMA has revealed the presence of molecular, CO gas in three evolved disk sources. These are several Myr-old low-mass stars that appear to have lost their protoplanetary disks given their low IR and mm-dust emission. The origin of their CO gas is unclear. Is it lingering \"ghost\" primordial gas left over from the earlier protoplanetary disk stage? Or is it second-generation, revived \"zombie\" gas released via collisions and/or outgassing of volatile-rich planetesimals? These two scenarios present different expectations for the gas composition. Primordial gas would be H2-rich, similar to protoplanetary disk gas. In contrast, secondary gas would be dominated by H2O and CO, similar to comets. We aim distinguish between these two scenarios by searching for N2H+, as a tracer of its requisite precursor H2. We propose to observe the N2H+ J=3-2 transition in NO Lup, TWA 34, and TWA 7. Detections of N2H+ will reveal the presence of H2-rich, primordial gas whereas non-detections will favor the secondary gas scenario. The results of this analysis will provide valuable data regarding the dissipation timescale and planet-forming lifetime of protoplanetary disk gases.',\n"," 'Shadows in time: resolving disk surface chemistry using inner disk shadows. Many chemical processes in the interstellar medium happen under conditions and on time-scales that cannot be easily probed with laboratory experiments here on Earth. However, protoplanetary disks can serve as excellent laboratories for astrochemistry as their geometry and physical conditions are well understood. In some protoplanetary disks, an inclined inner disk casts a shadow over half of the outer disk. This shadowing drastically changes the UV field in the surface layers of the disk. As disk material rotates into and out of this shadow on Keplerian orbits, we can use it to resolve the chemical evolution of material on 10-1000 yr timecales. This will allow us to infer reaction rates under astrophysical condtions. We propose to take this unique laboratory out for a spin to study the radical chemistry of CN and the ion-molecule chemistry of HCO+.',\n"," 'Resolving water emission in the early universe. We propose to detect and image water lines and infrared luminosity in three lensed starforming galaxies at z~3 from the SPT survey. With the lensing, we will achieve 1 kpc spatial resolution in the source plane. This will be the first time water is spatially resolved in galaxies at high redshift. We will test the recently observed and remarkable linearity of the L_H2O/L_IR correlation.',\n"," 'Searching for the Smoking Gun of Magnetar-Powered Super-Luminous Supernovae. Nascent strongly magnetized neutron stars (so-called magnetars) with rapid rotation have been considered to explain optical emission of super-luminous supernovae. They also give us a unified picture of stripped-envelope supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and even fast radio bursts. Pulsar wind nebulae are known to be efficient accelerators of electrons and positrons, so non-thermal synchrotron emission from the nascent nebulae is naturally expected. We propose to observe two super-luminous supernovae, SN 2015bn and SN 2016ard, with ALMA. Contrary to low-frequency radio emission that is largely suppressed by free-free absorption, submm synchrotron emission serves as a smoking gun of magnetars hidden in the supernova ejecta. A successful observation will provide us with the first evidence for a magnetar-like central engine as well as a clue to progenitors of fast radio bursts. Even non-detections will set stringent constraints on the magnetar-powered supernova model.',\n"," 'Sulfur and water mapping in the mesosphere of Venus. We propose to map sulfur and water in the mesosphere of Venus, using the SO2 transitions at 336.089 GHz and 346.652 GHz, the SO transition at 346.528 GHz and the HDO transition at 335.395 GHz in order to study the latitudinal and day/night variations of these species. In addition we will observe the CO (3-2) line at 345.795 GHz which will constrain both the thermal profile and the CO vertical distribution and will be used for wind mapping.',\n"," 'Resolving the complete outflow density and kinematics structures by observing [CI] (1-0). We take the advantage of the newly available, ACA stand-alone observational capability at Band 8 to propose high sensitivity, high signal-to-noise ratio(S/N) observations of the [CI]3P1-3P0 emission line in the local molecular outflows. We aim to explore the capability of the [CI](1-0) line to trace the outflow mass and compare it with the more commonly employed CO line gas tracers. Our survey will address the doubts raised from earlier outflow analysis by CO due to advantages of [CI](1-0), i.e., optically thin, simpler energy-level system, and low self-absorption. Our analysis will leave a rich legacy for future ALMA research beyond its justificataion on [CI](1-0) as a molecular outflow tracer. [CI](1-0) is a potential magnetic field tracer with the maximum polarization more than 20%. The survey of [CI](1-0) intensity in the outflow near FUV radiation helps to source selection for future atomic polarization measurement on interstellar magnetic field.',\n"," 'Statistical nature of the class I CH3OH maser clumps in high mass star-formation. We propose high-resolution molecular line observations toward 44 GHz class I CH3OH maser sources to investigate the physical environment of shocked regions traced by 44 GHz class I CH3OH masers.Previous interferometric studies of Class I CH3OH masers suggests that the masers trace the shocked gas in the dynamical structures in star forming region, such as outflows, HII regions, and the cloud-cloud collision. However, the detailed kinematics and physical environment of the region where the masers arise are still unclear due to the scarcity of high-resolution data of shock tracers and masers. From 2013, we started observations of 15 MYSOs associated with 44GHz CH3OH masers with KaVA, and this sample will give a unique chance to study the detailed information of physical environment of the shocked regions where maser arises by comparing high-resolution observations of shock tracers to VLBI images of masers.We will observe CO and H30a to trace the outflows and HII regions, SiO to trace shocked molecular gas.to compare the physical properties of shocked region with each maser features observed with VLBI, the high-spatial resolution and the high-sensitivity of ALMA is inevitable.',\n"," 'Probing Electron Acceleration Mechanism in Nearby Core-Collapse Supernovae. Identifying the site(s) of the particle acceleration and cosmic ray production has been an intensively studied field of particle astrophysics. The most promising mechanism requires the existence of a strong shock wave - in the standard scenario (`diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism), particles gain energy through repeated collisions between up- and down-streams of a shock wave. There is however a key issue in this picture – how the particles are injected into the acceleration site. This is especially a big issue if one considers electrons, known as the `electron injection problem’ – due to the small mass and small gyro radius, they are not easily able to cross the shock wave as is required by the DSA mechanism unless their energies exceed at least 100 MeV. Exploring how the electrons behave around this energy scale at the shock front is of essential importance to clarify the acceleration mechanism of electrons. Studying synchrotron emissions from young supernovae (SNe) sheds light on the issue. The hydrodynamic interaction between the expanding SN ejecta and circumstellar materials (CSM) creates a strong shock wave, accelerating electrons, producing synchrotron emission, as is similar to SN remnants. Young SNe are however unique in an observational potential as compared to SN remnants. Due to strong magnetic field content at the shock (an order of Gauss), for given frequency we can probe electrons with much lower energy than in SN remnants (in SN remnants, radio emissions are produced by electrons with the energy > 1 GeV). Indeed, radio observations (in cm wavelengths) of nearby young SNe have shown that the acceleration is not as efficient as predicted by the DSA mechanism in the energy below ~ 100 MeV. We propose ToO observations of one nearby core-collapse supernova (SN) at Band 3, 6, and 7 in three epochs – the first observations at about three weeks after the explosion, and then additional two epochs separated by about 3 weeks each. The total observing time including the overhead is estimated to be 7.3 hrs (Note that the time estimate by the OT is for a single epoch). A main goal is to constrain the electron acceleration mechanism at a shock wave. The synchrotron emission from young SNe in the ALMA bands probes the relativistic electron population at the energy of ~ 100 – 500 MeV, which has been unexplored in similar environments (SNe and SN remnants). In this energy range, we expect to see for the first time a transition from inefficient to efficient acceleration in the standard DSA theory of the particle acceleration. The multi-band and multi-epoch observation is essential, as we want to identify the characteristic frequency of the `transition’ which (monotonically) changes with time. If this is identified, it provides not only a solid confirmation of the DSA mechanism for electrons, but also a strong clue to solve the electron injection problem. For the proposed set up, we expect one or two candidates every year within reach by ALMA. Our goal is not reachable by other telescopes, and ALMA is a unique telescope to investigate the so-far unexplored mm/sub-mm properties of SNe. In addition to the study on the acceleration mechanism, the ALMA data will also be used to address astrophysical properties of SNe, e.g., the shock velocity and the circumstellar density connected to the explosion mechanism and progenitor evolution.',\n"," 'Searching for complex organic molecules in Orion cold cores. Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to be formed on warm grains (>30 K) and desorpted at high-enough temperature (>100 K). The detection of COMs in starless cores such as L1544 challenges the existing chemical model. Many chemical models were put forward to explain this, but mostly are not well constrained by enough observations. Previous observations were mainly conducted using single-dish telescope and biased to individual famous cold core. We propose to conduct ALMA ACA observations in Band 3 towards 16 candidate prestellar cores in Orion in several transitions of COMs, CH3OH and N2H+. With these data, we will for the first time systematically study the spatial distribution and segregation of COMs in cold cores, and their connections to evolutionary statuses. These informations are essential to constrain the chemical models of COMs.',\n"," 'The molecular gas content of the host galaxies of Fast Radio Bursts. The inability to localize the radiation from fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been the key stumbling block to unravelling the origin of their enigmatic emission. Over the last few months, the Australia SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) has obtained sub-arcsecond localization of three non-repeating FRBs, FRB180924, FRB181112 and FRB190102. Our optical imaging and spectroscopy have identified the FRB host galaxies, at z=0.3214, z=0.4755, and z=0.291, respectively. The 0.1-0.5 accuracy of our radio positions presents an outstanding opportunity to directly examine the progenitor environments of a sample of FRBs and trace the conditions that give rise to the bursts. Mapping the CO emission from the FRB host would allow us to test from the CO velocity field whether the FRB arises from a cataclysmic event. As the first step towards this mapping, we request ALMA Band-6 time to observe the CO J=3-2 emission from the three FRB host galaxies to measure their molecular gas content and star formation efficiency.',\n"," 'Late follow-up of the unique GRB171205A. GRBs are powered by compact objects that eject matter at ultra-relativistic velocities. This makes them ideal laboratories to study radiation processes in extreme conditions. Swift has detected >1000 GRB afterglows but only 20-30 were bright enough for extensive follow-up from radio to X-ray wavelengths to provide crucial constraints on the radiation processes. GRB171205A was a unique event, being the 4th closest long GRB to date and the second brightest in millimeter wavelengths. We have already started an extensive observing campaign between 600 MHz and X-rays. For the first time we have the opportunity to follow an event in millimeter wavelegths for over a year and explore the late deceleration of the afterglow and the transition to a non-relativistic phase. Combining data over a very long time in multiple frequencies will allow us to accurately measure the energetics of the event, precisely test the models, and characterise any non-standard radiation components. This is a short and easy to execute programme with only two continuum observations in Band 3.',\n"," 'CO spectroscopy for remarkably luminous Lyman break galaxies at z=6.030-6.203. We propose Band 3 observations for three remarkably luminous spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z=6.030-6.203, whose [CII] and dust continuum emission have been detected in our recent ALMA observations. This proposal aims at detecting their CO(6-5) emission and characterizing the properties of molecular gas components in SFGs at high redshifts, which has been poorly investigated in previous studies. We have two science goals: 1) Detecting CO emission lines from normal SFGs beyond redshift 6 for the first time and 2) Examining the redshift dependence of the gas depletion time in SFGs up to this high redshift. Even an extreme case of no CO detection is interesting, because such a result would suggest that invalidities of the empirical relation and/or the theoretical models, which need to be tested for high-z sources. This ALMA program will be a precursor study of our systematic survey for investigating the molecular gas properties of normal SFGs at high redshifts via CO emission line spectroscopy, which will be complementary to other studies targeting nebular fine-structure lines from high-z SFGs.',\n"," 'A Breakthrough in Measuring SMBH Masses in Type II AGNs: ALMAs Potential?. We propose a high risky high impact project to test the ability to measure masses of SMBHs in type II AGNs with ALMA, which may open a new window for such studies. The directly measured line width of the radio recombination lines, with the combination of the broad line region size derived with AGN luminosity, can offer a critical constraint of the black hole masses in type II AGNs. We select Circinus, the nearest type II AGN with known broad line width (~3300 km/s), and apply to observe H35a (147 GHz) and H36a (135 GHz) simultaneously with the band 4 receivers. If we can detect such lines and determine the line width in Circinus with two hours on-source time at cycle 2, it is possible to systematically survey the masses of SMBHs in type II AGNs when ALMA is fully commissioned. If it is not successfully, we have to wait for JWST to do mid-IR spectroscopy observation, which will still suffer from the continuum contamination from the torus. We obtained a ranking with 20%-40%, which was assigned as a filler project during Cycle 2. If it can be scheduled in Cycle 2, we will not request re-observation for this project.',\n"," 'Dense Gas Properties within 40 pc of a Super Star Cluster. Super Star Clusters (SSCs) are some of the most extreme examples of star formation in the Universe. This mode is important when star formation gets very intense, especially at high redshift, but is quite rare in the local Universe. NGC 5253 is the nearest example of a young SSC (proto-globular cluster). At 3.5 Mpc, we can be study the ISM - SSC connection down to within ~10 pc of a 2 Myr old, 10^9 Lo star cluster. Capitalizing on our previous ALMA observations that detect HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) in this low metallicity dwarf starburst for the first time and find very anomalous gas properties, we propose to observe HCO+(3-2) and HCN(3-2) simultaneously at sub-arcsecond scales to map out the ISM properties in the SSC environment. The goal of the project is to constrain the ~10 pc scale structure and kinematics of the dense molecular component and to determine dense gas excitation at ~40 pc scales. This will provide the closest look at the influences of SSC feedback on its molecular environment.',\n"," 'Hot or Warm? What are the dust temperatures of normal star-forming galaxies at z~7?. We propose to observe the rest-frame 90um dust continuum (Band 8) to determine dust temperatures of six z~7 galaxies. We will probe the peak of the infrared emission, which directly offers a constraint on the luminosity-weighted dust temperature and provides an accurate estimate of total infrared luminosity. Our observations will resolve the unsettled debate regarding the trend in the evolution of dust temperature at z>4, whether it continues to rise or it flatten. This will give us an insight into how dust properties evolve at high redshift, and lead to a better understanding of what drives the efficient growth of the dust mass in the first billion years of the universe. Together with the existing [CII]158um and rest-frame 160um data (Band 6), we have designed the observations to obtain the dust temperature with an uncertainty as small as +/-3K. Our targets are a subset of the spectroscopically confirmed sample of the first ALMA systematic [CII] survey of normal star-forming galaxies at z>6.5. The combination of our observing strategy and the unique z~7 targets offers a rare opportunity to stringently determine dust temperatures and their evolution in the early universe.',\n"," 'High angular resolution molecular and dust images of Supernova 1987A. Supernova (SN) 1987A is a unique SN, which modern telescopes can spatially resolve at wavelengths ranging from X-ray to radio. Its time evolution has been monitored over 30 years, revealing how a SN has transformed into a SN remnant in remarkable detail. For the cycle 6 program, we request deep high-angular resolution images of SN 1987A in bands 6, 7 & 9, covering SiO 6-5, SiO 7-6, CO 6-5 and dust 450-micron and 850-micron emission. The combination of these images will give temperature and column density maps of dust and SiO. Furthermore, SiO data provide the 3-dimensional velocity map of this molecule. With these images, we will investigate four science cases. (1) probing potential on-going interaction between ejecta dust and reverse shocks, (2) tracing the past dust formation and investigating chemistry operating in the SN ejecta (3) identifying the neutron star and (4) investigating the proper motion of clumps in the ejecta and its cooling.',\n"," 'From Hydrocarbons to Dust in Protoplanetary Nebulae. We propose to observe two carbon-rich protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe), CRL 618 and CRL 2688, to investigate the physical and chemical conditions that lead to complex hydrocarbon chemistry in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars after the AGB phase. Polyacetylenes and cyanopolyynes have been detected with ISO in both sources. However benzene, the first aromatic ring, is only seen in CRL 618. Only CRL 2688 shows emission from dust grains rich in aliphatics. For both molecules and grains, UV-processing was invoked as a key process in driving the chemical evolution. We want to explore the emission of vibrationally excited HCCCN in both sources, CCH, HCN, CN and CO to constraint the physical and chemical conditions. In addition towards CRL 618, HCO+ and a recombination line of Hydrogen will be observed to better characterize the photodissociation region (PDR) at the interface between the HII region and the torus. Only ALMA can addressed this project since PPNe have complex morphologies and the most active chemistry is expected to occur in the densest part at scales of 0.2 to ~1\". We will obtain unique data to investigate carbonaceous grain formation and evolution.',\n"," 'The puzzling JWST object timely distangled by ALMA: Dusty starburst at z~5 or Ultra high-z galaxy at z~17?. JWST has sparked a revolution of effort to discover and study galaxies at very early cosmic epochs. In particular, remarkably bright z~17 galaxy candidates are identified from several teams, which, if real, defies every early galaxy evolution model that assumes Lambda CDM cosmology. However, the latest study reports a tentative SCUBA2 850um detection from one of these candidates and shows that a z~5 dusty starburst galaxy with strong nebular emission lines can make its JWST/NIRCam broadband photometry at 1-5um resemble the extreme high-z galaxy SED. Here we propose a timely 1-hr ALMA Band 7 follow-up via DDT for such a z~17 galaxy candidate to confirm/rule out the lower-z scenario. Rather than waiting for the regular call, validating the robustness of first galaxy candidates at the farthest frontier is of urgent importance to the community in designing the next generation of follow-up observations, including ALMA cycle10 in April 2023 and JWST cycle2 in January 2023. Given this aspect, we waive the proprietary period of this DDT program.',\n"," 'Active geology on Europa: hot spots, plumes, and surface anomalies. Our Cycle 3 observations of Europa revealed the presence of multiple regions on the satellite elevated in temperature by more than 10 degrees above that expected. Such hot spots could be regions where liquid water has intruded within hundreds of meters of the surface. Indeed, one such previously suspected hot spot, revealed in very limited Galileo spacecraft nightside thermal data, is coincident with the location of a recently suggested recurring plume on Europa. Hot spots could be regions of currently active geology and windows into the interior ocean. Unfortunately, our Cycle 3 observations cannot determine if these hot spots are caused by internal heating, by localized anomalies in thermal inertia, or by unusual surface properties. Measuring the temperatures of these regions as they move from morning to noon to afternoon easily resolves these degeneracies as different types of hot spots have very different temperature histories. We propose to obtain Europa thermal maps every 30 degrees of rotation to allow us to discover and map true hot spots on Europa for the first time. Such spots will be clear and exciting targets for future observation and exploration.',\n"," 'Directly linking gas and ice abundances in low-mass protostars. The main scientific goal of this proposal is to test observationally whether complex molecules detected in the gas phase originally have been formed by solid-state processes in icy grain mantles, as assumed in most interstellar chemistry models.

Thanks to ALMA we are discovering a variety of small scale structures in an incresing number of protoplanetary disks, that were previously thought to have a smooth distribution of dust surface density. The exceptional brightness of the HD163296 system allowed us to observe both the dust and gas emission at a ~0.2arcsec resolution, revealing a three bright rings at 1.3mm wavelength, and a CO depletion compatible with the presence of neptune-like planets (Isella et al. 2016). Recently acquired observations at 3mm are showing us hints of differential dust segregation across the dust structures, but the current resolution is not sufficient for separating the spectral index measurements inside and outside such structures, and optical depth effects at 1mm do not allow us to trace the true surface density in the inner regions of the disk (<50 AU). We ask for Band 4 and Band 3 observations at a matched resolution in order to resolve the spectral index (and therefore the maximum grain size) across the rings seen at 1.3mm, and attenuate the optical depth effects in the inner disk.',\n"," 'Measuring the Size of a New Dwarf Planet Candidate. We seek to accurately measure the size of a new dwarf planet candidate discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The object is currently the second most distant known TNO at 92.5 AU with an r-band magnitude of 23.2, suggesting that its diameter may be >1000 km. An object of this size would be comparable to the largest main belt asteroid, Ceres, or Plutos moon Charon. Optical measurements alone cannot determine the candidates size because its albedo is unknown. TNOs are known to exhibit a wide range of albedos, from a dark, organic-rich 5% to icy 80% or more, meaning our candidate may range in size from 350-1200km. We propose to use ALMA to study the thermal emission of our candidate to obtain a more accurate size measurement and potentially establish it among the five largest known minor bodies in the solar system. This object, if found to have a low albedo and large diameter, would signal a larger population of 1000-km-class TNOs. Measurement of its size will also enable a calculation of its albedo/composition. Six hours of integration time will result in a robust detection of our dwarf planet candidate for even our smallest size estimate.',\n"," 'Measuring the Most Energetic Event in the Universe. Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally-bound objects in the Universe and, according to the hierarchical picture of structure formation, are the most recent to form. A crucial aspect of their formation is through mergers, which violently dissipate most of their kinetic energy in shocks. The merger in 1E0657-56 -- a.k.a. \"the Bullet Cluster\" -- is one of the cleanest astrophysical labs for shock physics and may be the single most energetic event in the visible Universe since the Big Bang itself. The Bullet Cluster provides direct evidence that clusters are dominated by cold dark matter through the large spatial s eparations between the gas and lensing peaks. We propose to use ALMA+ACA Band 3 observations to provide the first sensitive (~7.6 uJy/bm), high-resolution (<8\") Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect measurement of the shock front in the Bullet Cluster. We will jointly model the ALMA measurements of the shock with deep X-ray data from the Chandra and NuSTAR X-ray telescopes, and compare these measurements to existing arcminute-resolution measurements to place more direct constraints on the shock energetics and better infer the line of sight distribution of the gas.',\n"," 'Phosphorus-bearing molecules towards a Solar-system precursor. The study of the chemical composition of planet-forming regions is a fundamental step to understand how prebiotic chemistry could proceed in the early Earth. Phosphorus compounds, and in particular the P-O chemical bond, play a key role in the formation large biomolecules such as DNA. We have recently detected PO for the first time towards massive star-forming regions, but the detection towards a Solar-system precursor at protoplanetary disk scales (< 100 au) is still lacking. This project proposes to detect PO (and also PN) towards the Solar-like protostellar system IRAS16293-2422 at high spatial resolution (0.35 au). This will allow us to disentangle if the P-bearing emission previously detected with a single-dish telescope arises from the centrifugal barrier (~50 au), the surrounding envelope (50-200 au) or from more extended gas associated molecular outflows (>200 au). This will put important constraints about the formation of P-bearing molecules. The molecular abundances of PO and PN will be compared with those we have recently derived in the comet 67P to investigate if there is a Phosphorus chemical thread.',\n"," 'From Dark to Light: Star Clusters in Formation. We propose to study the disk and envelope properties of YSOs in the dense star forming environments of Serpens Main and Serpens South -two young clusters, one with an age of 100,000-200,000 years and the other around 2 million years. We will survey 51 known and suspected YSOs in Serpens Main and 44 in Serpens South with 0.6\" resolution in the continuum at 220 GHZ and the DCO+ J=3-2 line. We have chosen a combination of resolution and spatial frequency coverage which will allow us to measure the disk mass (inside 250 AU) and envelope mass (inside 4000 AU) in these sources. Even with 2 minute integrations per source, we can improve on previous studies of these regions by nearly a factor of 100 in mass sensitivity and a factor of 9 in resolution. The results will reveal how much circumstellar mass and its distribution varies with age and YSO luminosity. The requested observations are deep enough that we hope to detect circumstellar mass associated with significantly sub-solar luminosity objects, allowing identifications of new YSOs in the cluster.',\n"," 'Surveying the diversity of asteroid surfaces. The main asteroid belt population shows a remarkable diversity in composition and surface properties, which reflects the formation locations and subsequent collisional and dynamical evolution of these objects, as well as the space weathering of their surfaces. ALMA enables high spatial resolution measurements of asteroid thermal emission and polarization, providing a powerful new tool for asteroid surface characterization. The only three objects observed with this technique to date lie at the highly-processed and metal-rich end of the compositional spectrum. We propose to broaden the sample of objects observed with this technique by observing ten new targets over a range of spectral classes to understand how surface composition and thermophysical properties correlate with spectral type, and strengthen the link between asteroid spectral classes and their formation and evolutionary pathways.',\n"," 'Excitation conditions of the diffuse gas traced by [CI] in main sequence galaxies at z~1.2. Atomic carbon CI has been proposed as a tracer of cold gas in galaxies in alternative to dust and CO. To date, only lensed SMGs and QSOs are [CI]-detected at high z, completely missing the bulk of the normal main-sequence (MS) population. Thus, we started an ALMA survey to detect [CI](1-0) in MS galaxies at z=1.2, partially covered in CO(2-1) and CO(5-4). First results confirm that [CI](1-0) is an excellent gas tracer and that MS galaxies are offset from starbursts (SB) in the IR vs [CI](1-0) luminosity plane, while being 4x less CI rich. We now aim to study the excitation conditions of the gas traced by CI observing the [CI](2-1) transition. In 11.5 hours of Band 7, we will (1) derive the excitation temperature Texc~[CI](2-1)/[CI](1-0) for 7 sources with [CI](1-0) and dust continuum detection from our survey; (2) study systematic differences among gas conditions in MS galaxies and SMGs/QSOs/SBs; (3) evaluate the dust temperature as a proxy for Texc, a common assumption with limited empirical support; (4) finalize a comprehensive analysis in a sample of well studied MS galaxies by comparing [CI](1-0), [CI](2-1), CO(2-1), CO(5-4), and CO(7-6) (obtained while observing [CI](2-1)).',\n"," 'Probing into the Deep: Characterizing Substructure in Disks Around the Youngest Protostars. A hallmark of gravitationally unstable disks is their spiral structure and fragmentation due to self-gravity. Despite the progress and robustness of gravitational instability theory and simulations, observations of gravitationally unstable disks, traced by dust continuum emission in the disk midplanes, have thus far remained elusive. We have identified three protostellar systems with VLA-detected companions at ~20AU separations that are surrounded by >0.1 M_sun circumbinary structures. Given that the companion sources likely formed within these disks, we propose 3mm continuum observations at 0.078\" (18 AU) resolution (same as the VLA resolution) to characterize the structure of the circumbinary disks and resolve the companion sources with ALMA. The proposed ALMA observations will be able to map the VLA-detected dust emission with a factor of ~6.6x higher S/N due to brighter dust emission at 3mm, enabling us to characterize substructure in the circumbinary disks, which could not be done with the VLA data. Thus, the proposed observations have the potential to reveal new details in the process of binary star formation and structure of gravitationally unstable disks.',\n"," 'Physics of the interstellar medium of galaxies in the reionization era: the [OIII]-to-[CII] line ratio II.

We propose conducting two epochs of linear polarimetry with Band3 and Band4 using the 12-m array and photometry with Band3/4/5 using the standalone mode of ACA for the brigh GRB221009A afterglows to constrain the fraction of non-energized electrons along with the spectrum peak. The energetic GRB221009A (2-3 orders larger than the typical one) was just discovered on 9 Oct. 2022. Intensive multi-wavelength observations have been ongoing. One notable feature is the association of very high-energy photons up to 18 TeV. These prompt emission features make GRB221009A one of the historical events. The first X-ray polarimetry for the X-ray afterglow by NASAs IXPE satellite. Radio polarimetry using ALMA would enhance understanding of this energetic GRB.',\n"," 'A redshift survey of Herschel ultrared dusty, star-forming galaxies at z > 4. Studies of rare z > 4 dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) are important for understanding the physical drivers of extreme star formation, mass assembly and growth, and their evolutionary connections with other populations. The largest Herschel surveys, HerMES and H-ATLAS, have selected a large number of DSFGs. Selecting those with ultrared colors in SPIRE bands (500um-risers: S500 > S350 > S250) is extremely efficient for identifying DSFGs at z > 4. We are carrying out a multi-wavelength observational campaign aimed at characterizing their gas, dust, and stellar properties. The most urgently missing information are their spectroscopic redshifts. We propose ALMA 3mm spectral scans of 38 Herschel ultrared DSFGs to obtain robust spectroscopic redshifts, via the detection of multiple molecular and/or atomic lines. This will be a complete redshift survey of DSFGs at z > 4 down to the 500um-riser selection thresholds. All the targets in this sample have existing multi-wavelength data including Spitzer/IRAC, and are just awaiting spectroscopic redshifts, in order to to fully characterize this population, and determine the space density, SFR density, and stellar mass density at z > 4.',\n"," 'Control of Star Formation in Massive Filamentary Clouds: Orion. The Herschel mission has revealed omnipresent filamentary structures in molecular clouds. Such structures possibly govern the entire star formation process in the interstellar medium. In this picture, high-mass stars and star-clusters form preferentially in massive filaments whose properties differ from those of low-mass ones, demonstrating a strong environmental dependence. What is crucially missing is the knowledge of how massive filaments fragment and collapse to form stars. With ALMA, we will fill this knowledge gap by describing the fragmentation of the most nearby massive filament, the Orion filament, in great detail. We will observe the filament in 110 GHz continuum and C18O line emission. These data, together with our Herschel and LABOCA data, will provide the highest-fidelity column density data ever obtained for a molecular cloud, from several-parsec scales to 1700 AU scales. We will determine the fragmentation mode of the filament with our novel techniques that recover both the volume density and kinematic structure. We will then connect this analysis with our protostellar census, establishing how filament fragmentation connects to the protostars within.',\n"," 'Resolving the duality of star-formation relations in LIRGs. We propose to map the emission of a set of dense molecular gas tracers (HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0) and CS(2-1)) in six local LIRGs using the unique spatial resolution (0.2\"~65 pc) and sensitivity of ALMA. This project builds on improving our knowledge of the formation and evolution of galaxies from the study of the star formation relations. The use of specific molecular gas tracers can probe the influence of the dynamical environment in the star formation process. Just recently, several works found that the star formation occurs in certain regions within galaxies, more specifically, some local LIRGs show a dual behaviour in the star formation relations. This duality shows two different dynamical environments depending on the distance relative to the centre of the galaxy. This project focuses on characterising the mechanisms involved in the dual and non-dual behaviour of local LIRGs found in the star formation relations and gives us information about the influence of the dynamical environment at forming stars. This work also helps to improve the star fomation models.',\n"," 'Unveiling the role of filamentary structures in star formation toward the mini-starburst region NGC6334. The NGC6334 molecular complex is one of the nearest mini-starburst star formation regions, i.e., a miniature model of starburst galaxies. Using recent ACA band 3 observations of NGC6334, 25 filaments in the position-position-velocity space are revealed. These filaments show longitudinal velocity gradients, gas infall signatures, narrow-line SiO emission, and oscillating velocity and intensity. Unfortunately, the poor angular resolution (18\"x10\") and sensitivity (1sigma mass ~10Msun) prevents from studying filaments and embedded cores in detail. Therefore, we propose this follow-up ALMA program with a higher angular resolution (3\") and sensitivity (1sigma mass ~0.13 Msun), in order to: 1) spatially and spectrally resolve filaments and embedded dense cores, 2) characterize the gas kinematics from ~1 pc filament scale down to ~0.02 pc core scale, and 3) examine the feasibility of using the SiO emission to trace the fossil record of the filament formation. This program will provide an unprecedented view of the global dynamical picture of the filament-based mini-starburst in NGC6334, which promises to unveil how the filament network promotes star formation in mini-starburst regions.',\n"," 'Circumnuclear Holes around Supermassive Black Holes. Galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are likely co-evolving, and the most accepted paradigm is an evolutionary process that involves self-regulating feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent high-resolution observations of nearby galaxies are revealing ~10-100 pc CO holes at their circumnuclear regions in 20 % of the galaxy, independent of their current nuclear activity. The origin of these circumnuclear holes are unknown, but their radii typically corresponds to the SMBH potential, suggesting that the SMBHs are the cause. If these holes are developed without powerful AGN, the SMBHs must be creating these holes through heating or dynamical effects. This suggests secular effects can impede accretion of gas, making it harder for AGN accretion to occur. To unravel the cause of these circumnuclear holes, we propose to observe the HCN(1-0), CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) lines in three galaxies with known CO(2-1) holes, to probe the presence of gas and analyse the physical state of the SMBH surroundings. The results will help to clarify the origin of circumnuclear holes, and thus will reveal direct evidence of their feedback even without a luminous AGN.',\n"," 'Probing the Gas Excitation in high redshift Main Sequence Galaxies. Recent CO observations in normal main-sequence galaxies at high redshift have shown that their star formation efficiency is lower than in case of merger driven SMGs, more consistent with the star formation efficiency in local spiral galaxies. The picture that emerges from this studies is that SMGs form stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more compressed so they churn more quickly through the available gas reservoir than the typical normal high-z disk galaxies. These differences in the physical conditions of the ISM are expected to affect the CO and CI line ratios. Indeed earlier studies of low-J CO transitions suggest that main sequence galaxies have similar ISM properties than the MW. A coherent picture of the gas excitation in these systems, however, is missing so far. We here aim to investigate the gas excitation in three main-sequence galaxies selected from the PHIBSS survey. We propose to study the shape of the CO SED in conjunction with both lines of atomic carbon to investigate the physical conditions of their ISM. Our study aims to provide for the first time well characterized templates of the gas excitation in high redshift main-sequence galaxies.',\n"," 'Observing in real time the onset of outflow collimation in a massive protostar. Over 20 yr we have seen in “real time” that the expanding H2O maser shell found around the radio continuum emission of the massive protostar W75N VLA2, as well as the continuum source itself have evolved from an almost isotropic outflow into a jet (phenomenon not seen before in any protostar). We interpret this unique behavior in terms of an episodic, short-lived (tens of years), originally isotropic ionized wind whose morphology evolves as it moves within a toroidal density stratification. Through ALMA Band 6 continuum observations we will test this scenario by detecting the expected dust torus around VLA2. In addition, through molecular line observations we also expect to find collimated outflows associated with VLA2 and VLA1 (a radio jet separated from VLA 2 by 0.7”), parallel to each other and to the magnetic field orientation we found in the region. If such a parallel orientation of the outflows is observed, this would strongly indicate that the magnetic field plays a key role in the ejection and evolution of the outflows of these massive protostars. This opens a new, exciting window of opportunity to study how basic ingredients of massive star formation evolve in “real time\".',\n"," 'A mm snapshot survey of nearby young stars observed in scattered light. In the past years ALMA and scattered light observations have revealed a zoo of planet forming disk morphologies. Of particular value is the synergy between the two techniques, tracing different dust populations and vertical extends of the disk. While scattered light observations trace small dust particles, well coupled to the gas on the disk surface, mm-emission trace the bulk-mass of material close to the disk mid-plane. Recent studies of small scattered light surveys have found that there is a correlation between the dust-mass of the disk and the present sub-structures, with more massive disks typically showing gaps or cavities in scattered light. Such findings are still tentative due to small sample sizes of scattered light surveys, for which accompanying mm continuum data exists. In this program we propose to obtain low-spatial resolution ALMA Band 6 flux measurements of a unique sample of disks, which is currently targeted by scattered light surveys. All 29 targets stars in this sample show strong near or mid-infrared excess and have in some cases already been resolved in scattered light. The proposed flux measurements will critically allow us to constrain their dust masses.',\n"," 'More than LESS: The first fully-identified submillimetre survey. Ultraluminous infrared galaxies, specifically submillimetre-selected galaxies - SMGs, are a significant class of star-forming galaxies at z>1. There are a few thousand SMGs known, but no sample has the complete, secure identifications needed to derive their basic properties. We propose compact Band 7 continuum observations to precisely locate the submillimetre-emitting components in a complete sample of 126 SMGs selected from the recent LABOCA survey of the ECDFS. These observations will pin-point the submillimetre-luminous components within these sources, without recourse to statistical associations using radio/mid-/far-infrared counterparts. ALMA will thus address two key shortcomings of current submillimetre surveys: (1) Source blending - many SMGs are expected to be blended at the resolution of their discover maps. To determine the true form of the submillimetre counts - a key observable constraint of theoretical galaxy formation models - we need ALMA-resolution maps of a large sample of SMGs. (2) Incomplete identifications - the radio/mid-/far-infrared data miss the most distant (and coolest) SMGs due to their K-corrections, this biases the derived redshift distribution. ALMA will identify all the SMG counterparts in the same band they were selected in, irrespective of their redshift/spectral properties, testing the validity of the radio/mid-/far-infrared identifications (when present) and uncovering the high-redshift tail of SMGs. The improved resolution of the ALMA maps will also show the relation between obscured starburst and unobscured stellar mass and AGN activity within these systems. These 5.4-hrs of observations will provide revolutionary science - addressing fundamental questions about the nature of SMGs - in a way which was impossible before ALMA.',\n"," 'The Evolution of Disks Around Low-mass Stars. The lifetime of primordial, optically thick disks around young stars places empirical constraints on the timescale to form planetary systems. Submillimeter observations play a critical role in quantifying the evolution since the emission is optically thin over most of the disk and probes the cool material where most of the disk mass resides and where most planets form. We request time with ALMA to image the dust and gas toward a complete sample of disks around stars in the 5-11 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB Association that have spectral types between M4.75 and G0, corresponding to stellar masses between about 0.2 and 2 Msun. Upper Sco is the nearest OB association of this age, and thereby provides an opportunity to obtain sensitive measurements of the disk properties at the end stage in the lifetime of primordial disks. By comparing the dust emission from disks in Upper Sco with existing continuum observations of 1 Myr stars in Taurus, we aim to measure 1) the amount of dust that is dispersed from disks on 5-10 Myr timescales, 2) the efficiency of disk dispersal as a function of stellar mass, and 3) how the dust mass evolves between evolutionary states.',\n"," 'Direct measurement of planet-forming gas mass using line pressure broadening. The gas mass in the main planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks is one of the most important parameters for understanding planet formation processes. However, measuring the gas mass has been challenging due to the lack of an H2 gas tracer. The recent discovery of the pressure broadened CO line wings has allowed the first direct and accurate measurement of the gas mass in a protoplanetary disk. Based on this groundbreaking discovery, we propose deep observations of the 12CO 3-2 line in four protoplanetary disks to detect the pressure-broadened line wings, as well as the 13C18O line to measure the CO column density. By combining these observations, we will determine the H2 gas mass in the main planet-forming regions and robustly assess their planet formation potential for the first time. The proposed observations will revolutionize the measurement of planet-forming gas mass.',\n"," 'Characterizing the physical conditions of star-forming ISM at z=6. Recent near-infrared spectroscopy studies of massive quiescent galaxies at z=4 suggest that they were formed by z>5 with a strong and short burst of star formation. Submillimeter bright galaxies (SMGs) at z=6 are the most likely progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at z=4. This proposal requests 6 hours of ALMA time to characterize the physical conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) in an extreme starburst galaxy at the reionization epoch. We aim to observe the [CII] 158um, [OI] 145 um, and [NII] 122 um far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines. Combining the measurement of the line fluxes with that of [OIII] 88 um and [NII] 205 um in ALMA archival data, we will be able to derive the physical properties of both ionized and PDR gas in the SMG at z=6: 1) gas density in ionized regions, 2) gas density in PDRs, 3) PDR fraction of [CII] emission, 4) ionized/PDR volume filling factor, 5) gas-phase metallicity, 6) strength of radiation field from the line ratios, and 7) dust temperature from dust continuum SEDs.',\n"," '[NII] 205 um at z~3-5.7. We propose to observe the [NII]205 micron transition in 16 dusty star forming galaxies previously detected in low or mid-J CO and the [CII]158 micron line and distributed at redshifts z~3-5.7. The [NII]205 line is a sensitive tracer of ionized gas, and complements the [CII] line as a star formation diagnostic. We will use the [NII] line to measure the ionized gas mass, characterize the ionizing source (as O stars or B stars), and we will use the [NII]/[CII] ratio to determine how much of the measured [CII] arises from ionized rather than neutral gas - a crucial parameter for interpreting current and future [CII] surveys. Our observations will dramatically increase the number of [NII] detections at high redshift. This project complements the work of our (ongoing) A-ranked, cycle 3 project to characterize [NII] in z~1-2 galaxies. This addition to our [NII] campaign allows a unique look at star formation, tracing trends in [NII] throughout the epochs of peak star formation and galaxy assembly.',\n"," 'The Precessing Molecular Jet in the NGC1377 Nucleus: Outburst from an Accreting SMBH. We propose high resolution (0.\"04= 4 pc) Band 7 ALMA observations of the center of the unusual S0 galaxy NGC1377. With ALMA we discovered a highly collimated molecular outflow in NGC1377 with velocity reversals that we attribute to a precessing molecular jet. The presence of the jet signals an unexplored and transient phase in the feeding of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our goal is to resolve the jet near the enshrouded nucleus and search for a hot circumnuclear torus. By mapping in the CO-3-2 and vibrationally excited HCN emission we will trace different physical conditions allowing us to probe separate components of the nucleus. We aim to (1) determine if the jet is powered by hot or cold accretion and if it is currently destroying its torus, and (2) investigate if the apparent precession is caused by a misaligned accretion flow or by a binary SMBH. This evolutionary phase should be extremely short-lived, which can explain other features of NGC1377, including its extraordinarily weak radio emission (far below the FIR-radio correlation). NGC1377 is nearby and offers a prime opportunity to study the interplay between SMBH growth and feedback in unprecedented detail.',\n"," 'Monitoring radio emission of the youngest planetary system with ALMA. Millimeter or submm emission has never been detected from exoplanets or their hosts up to date. The recently discovered hot Jupiter V830 Tau b orbiting a weak-line TT star with a strong magnetic field is a promising system for a first detection in submm wavelength. The system has been detected twice in centimeter by VLA and VLBA among 5 observations, and thus the system is highly variable in radio emission. It is unclear why it varies, and whether it emits from the star, the planet or an interaction between them. We propose to observe the system 5 times in Band 3 with uneven intervals in about 20 days, and a single observation in Band 6 with ALMA, both aiming to reach a sensivitiy of 18uJy. The detection or the non-detection will firstly give us crucial constrainst on the origin of radio emission, and will help to understand the varibility of radio emissions. A first detection of mm-wavelength emission will open a new window for the study of exoplanets, and provide important information about magnetic fields, and therefore planets interior structure, habitability and atmospheric retention.',\n"," 'The host properties and environment of high-redshift radio galaxies with ACA. It is now accepted that radio-emitting jets might be one of the main ingredients shaping the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. There is wide observational evidence that the super-massive black holes responsible for such jets reside in the most massive galaxy population, which in turn reside in large scale structures. This trend seems to have settled long time ago, making radio-AGN a natural lighthouse of such structures in the early Universe. However, pinpointing these early radio-AGN and studying their hosts has been harder to accomplish, with only recent reasonable numbers of radio-AGN host studies coming to light at z>2. This proposal aims to provide a statistical understanding of radio-AGN found within 4deg2 in the ELAIS-S1 field known to have the lowest foreground contamination, hence ideal for mid-IR observations with JWST. We propose to observe 41 high-redshift radio-AGN (selected either via their ultra-steep radio spectrum or extreme IR-to-radio flux ratios) at 1.3mm with ACA down to rms=0.2mJy. The ACA field of view will in addition allow us to assess the star-formation activity in the local environment of these galaxies (within a radius of ~180kpc at z~2).',\n"," 'Completing the SPT+ALMA Redshift Survey. Recent ground and space-based multi wavelength (sub)millimeter surveys have discovered a large number of strongly lensed, ultra-bright sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). From these surveys, particularly the 2500 square degree South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, we have constructed a catalog of these 81 high-redshift SMGs. Blind scans using ALMAs 3mm line capabilities have proven useful for determining spectroscopic redshifts. Previous ALMA proposals have enabled us to determine the spectroscopic redshifts for 76 of these sources using ALMAs 3mm line scans. In this proposal, we present the last 13 sources for which we only detect a single line feature. In these cases, we can only narrow the line identification to two plausible CO transitions, which leads to ambiguity in our results. We therefore request an additional 7.42 hours of observing time in order detect a second CO line in band 4, which would confirm their redshift. Obtaining robust redshifts for the complete catalog of SPT sources will enable further study into star formation rate for this highly elusive population of galaxies, and further our understanding of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'CO spectral scanning of z>6.5 QSO candidates selected from PanSTARRS. We propose ALMA spectroscopy of 23 QSO candidates at z>6.5 selected from the new PanSTARRS1 3pi survey. Our goal is to build a statistical sample of z> 6.5 QSOs, which is crucial for understanding of the reionization epoch and growth of the supermassive black holes in the early Universe. All targets are clear z-band dropouts (detectable only in the y band) with faint/no detection in WISE. This makes them very promising high-redshift QSO candidates. We propose a new and more efficient spectroscopic survey, by spectral scanning CO(6-5) emission in ALMA Band 3. The redshifted CO(6-5) line is between 84 and 92 GHz. Therefore, we only need two tunings to scan the CO line at 6.5',\n"," 'Small-Scale Clustering of CO emitters around Quasars at z~4. Luminous quasars (QSOs) at z~4 are the most strongly clustered population known at this epoch, and should thus reside in massive dark matter halos surrounded by large overdensities of galaxies. In order to quantify overdensities of optical galaxies around QSOs, we recently conducted a survey for Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the environs of 17 QSOs at z~4 and measured the QSO-LAE cross-correlation function. We detected an LAE overdensity of 1.4 in QSO fields and found that LAEs are significantly clustered around the QSO. However, our measurements fall short of the predicted overdensities by a factor of 2.1. This discrepancy could be explained by the presence of excess dust in galaxies near QSOs, which make them invisible in the optical. Here we propose to use ALMA to explore this possibility and quantify the overdensities of CO(4-3) emitters in the environments of our 17 QSOs, by measuring the QSO-CO emitter cross-correlation function at small (< 1 Mpc) scales. The proposed dataset represents the final piece to clearly characterize high-z QSO environments, ultimately allowing us to trace simultaneously the clustering of both optical and dusty galaxy populations around QSOs.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas in Local Merging ULIRGs. Hierarchical galaxy formation scenario predicts that galaxy-galaxy interaction and merger are the fundamental process that are related to the evolution of galaxies in the universe, changing the galaxy morphology and triggering intense starbursts and/or AGN activity. Recent high resolution simulations have shown that tidal interaction is responsible for forming massive clumps of dense gas surrounded by diffuse gas clouds and triggering star formation across the galaxy disks. An observational test of gas response requires mapping both the diffuse and dense gas tracers in merging U/LIRGs at high spatial resolution. Here we propose a systematic CO(1-0), CO(3-2), HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3) survey of 6 of the brightest merging ULIRGs in the local universe at 0.3 arcsec (200 pc) resolution of ALMA. The primary aim of this study is to map the distribution and kinematics of warm/dense molecular gas and the dense gas mass fraction and interpret their relation to star formation and AGN activities in the context of the merger-induced response of the ISM in the progenitor disks.',\n"," 'Quantifying gas inside dust cavities in transitional disks: mass, distribution and composition. Transitional disks with large inner dust cavities are thought to be the best laboratories for studying disk evolution during the planet-forming stage. Little is known about the gas inside dust cavities, yet this gas significantly affects planet formation through gas-grain dynamics and planetary migration whereas its chemistry controls the composition of gas-giant atmospheres. We propose here pioneering ALMA Band 7 observations of 13CO, C18O and CN 3-2 lines and the millimeter continuum to provide deep searches for molecular gas inside the dust cavities. The three proposed sources are part of only a handful of transitional disks with known CO IR emission and large enough dust cavities to be studied in Cycle 1. They span a range of spectral types and other disk parameters, allowing similarities and differences among the small sample to be studied. The huge leap in sensitivity provided by ALMA, in combination with new thermo-chemical models to interpret the data, allows a large range of gas masses inside the hole to be tested, down to about an Earth mass. This, in turn, allows the origin of the cavity in this disk to be determined: substellar or (multi-)planetary mass companions versus grain growth or photoevaporation. The CN/CO ratio provides initial insight into the chemical composition of the gas and its variations within and outside the cavity.',\n"," 'Accretion and Feedback of a Very Massive Protostar. Forming massive stars become so luminous that their ionizing feedback may stop the accretion and limit their further growth. In order to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in the formation of very massive stars, we propose ALMA Band 7 highest resolution observations of continuum and hydrogen recombination lines toward the massive young stellar object G45.47+0.05. Previous Band 6 observations reveal an hourglass-shape bipolar photoevaporative outflow in this source, which may also drive a strong jet with nonthermal emissions embedded inside the ionized outflow, suggesting on-going accretion. Here we aim to probe the dust component surrounding the ionized outflow and inner ionized disk to investigate the impact of the photoionization feedback on the accretion disk and surrounding material. We also aim to use hydrogen recombination lines to study the kinematics of the ionized gas, especially disk rotation and the outflow motions to test the disk accretion scenario and evaluate the strength of feedback. These observations will put strong constraints on how feedback and accretion processes interact with each other around a forming star of at least 40 solar masses.',\n"," 'Determination of the TW Hya Disk Mass. The main constituent of protoplanetary disks, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not emit from the disk mass reservoir and the most common technique to measure the disk gas mass in extra-solar systems is via dust thermal emission. However, this method generally assumes that we know how the grain properties and the gas-to-dust mass ratio evolve from their interstellar medium values which is highly model dependent and poorly constrained by actual observations. Thus even in TW Hya, the closest template object, there is a large discrepancy in the total disk mass. We propose here to use ALMA, combined with unique Herschel data, to determine the total disk gas mass in the TW Hya disk. Recently, using Herschel, we detected the ground-state transition of HD, an excellent probe of H2 gas, and therefore mass. This transition is however sensitive to the disk gas temperature structure deeper inside the disk than probed by CO. We request observations of 13CO (with C18O) J = 6 - 5 and J = 3 - 2 at an angular resolution of 0.5\", thereby resolving the region where 25 - 60% of the HD emission is predicted to arise. The ALMA and Herschel data will be used in tandem to to empirically determine the gas excitation deep in the TW Hya disk and its gas mass.This is a fundamental estimate of the primary quantity that controls planet formation.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas content of a ULIRG at z>7. While we have made great progress characterizing galaxy growth over the first billion years of the Universe, there is still a fundamental gap in our understanding. Stellar mass content studies as well as star formation rate estimates both coincide in showing that early galaxies grew very rapidly, but what sustains this growth? Are high-z galaxies particularly efficient at forming stars or do they have particularly large molecular gas reservoirs fueling their growth? Answering this question requires studying the molecular gas content of galaxies, and at z>7, high-J CO lines are our best bet. Recent samples of bright [CII] detected galaxies have opened the door to such studies but they still remain very challenging due to how faint CO lines are expected to be. Here we propose a first study of the molecular content of a galaxy at z>7 through the CO(7-6) line. Our source is a ULIRG, bright in [CII], with enhanced metallicity, and dust content (compared to galaxies at similar redshift). This combination implies a higher CO content, and dust shielding that prevents CO photodissociation. This is one of the best sources for a first study of the molecular gas content in a galaxy at z>7.',\n"," 'Trace the molecular gas reservoir in ULIRGs with co-existing extreme ionized outflows and vigorous starbursts. Ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) are thought to represent the rapidly growing phase of massive galaxies before quenching of their star formation by powerful AGN-driven outflows. In order to examine the statistical AGN and outflow properties of ULIRGs, we have constructed an AKARI 90 um flux limited complete catalog of 1028 ULIRGs at z=0.1-1.0. Five ULIRGs in the sample show extremely fast outflows (v > 1500 km/s), which are the most powerful outflows observed among ULIRGs and AGNs at z<1. However, the star formation activities in the five ULIRGs are highly intense with SFR of 300-2000 Msun/yr, comparable to the SFR of high-z ULIRGs. The co-existence of the extremely strong outflows and the intense SF activities is conflicting with the classical AGN feedback scenario. One possibility is that although the AGN-driven wind is powerful, it has only affected the hot, ionized gas, but not affected the cold, molecular clouds in which star formation occurs. In order to reveal the physical explanation behind the co-existence of the strong outflows and SF activities in these ULIRGs, it is crucial to determine the status of molecular clouds with sub-millimeter observations.',\n"," 'Irradiated Shocks and Ionisation Sources in the Central Parsec of the Milky Way. We propose to study the origin and nature of the irradiated shocks in the interstellar environment surrounding SgrA*, the very centre of the Milky Way. We will use ALMA to resolve the spatial structures and kinematical patterns associated with the high-velocity CO line emission at the interface between the circum-nuclear disk and the inner central cavity. This component is beam diluted in our single-dish Herschel observations of the complete CO rotational ladder but can be inferred from the line profiles. Our observations using all 3 instruments on board Herschel have also revealed the presence of overabundant H2O and OH, as well as unexpected hot CO in the vicinity of SgrA*. We wish to understand the origin of this high velocity gas, and its heating and ionisation sources, using ALMA to search for the key missing information and to determine both the spatial structure and the ionization fraction using well established molecular tracers (HCO+, HOC+ and SO+).',\n"," 'Turbulent Structure around the Very Low-Mass Class 0 Protostar IRAS 15398-3359. A principal goal of this proposal is to reveal the velocity structure and the angular momentum distribution of the protostellar core of the very young low-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398-3359 and characterize its turbulent eddies/elements. In this source, two past outflows have recently been identified in addition to the on-going outflow, whose directions are largely different from one another. Such a dramatic reorientation of the outflow is most likely caused by episodic accretion events of the turbulent gas elements with different angular momentum axes. To examine such complex structures of the protostellar core, we observe the H13CO+ and CO isotopologue lines in Band 3 and analyze them by using two kinds of autocorrelation functions (ACFs), from which we derive the coherent size of the spectrum feature and that of the velocity gradient. They are used to evaluate the size scale of the co-rotating fluid elements in the core. This observation is a novel attempt to study the turbulent structure of protostellar cores and will largely develop our understanding of its importance in the earliest stage of star formation.',\n"," 'Tending the Fire: A Survey of Molecular Gas Fueling in Powerful Nearby AGN.

Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at high redshift are thought to be dominantly highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies that represent extreme, short-lived starbursts. This picture is supported by studies of gas dynamics, but unfortunately, the resolution of past studies remained limited to 3-4 kpc even for the best handful of cases (with only a single exception), which is barely adequate to resolve the galaxies. Through a novel selection technique based on Herschel/SPIRE colors, we have identified a new sample of DSFGs at z=4.16-6.34. Using the new long baselines of ALMA, we propose to study the [CII] gas dynamics, OH and dust in 4 representative z=4.2-5.2 starbursts in our sample down to 500pc resolution. Based on dynamical models, we will investigate the occurence rate of major mergers vs. disks, measure dynamical masses, and constrain the physical properties of individual gas clumps down to physical scales not previously accessible outside the local universe. We will also search for faint, \"CO-dark\", perhaps low-metallicity companion galaxies within 100-150kpc of our massive, dusty starbursts. This comprehensive investigation will remain unrivaled for years to come.',\n"," 'SZ observations of 3 Cool-Core Clusters on the Sloshing Spectrum. Feedback processes have a profound influence on the physics of galaxy clusters, and are thought to be the main mechanism by which runaway cooling flows and star formation are suppressed in the cores of galaxy clusters. Feedback is also difficult to model in cosmological simulations, and is likely the main effect that can lead to a mismatch between simulations of large scale structure and observations. We propose to observe 3 cool-core clusters which are superficially similar, but contain key discrepancies in the level of gas sloshing that likely persists after past, small-scale merger events. This rich dataset will be used to probe 1) the pressure profiles in the core (thought to obey a universal form in cool-core clusters), 2) turbulence and the SZ power spectrum, 3) offsets in the SZ peak, which would challenge the X-ray and simulation-based interpretation of sloshing in clusters, and 4) bubbles from AGN feedback. These observations will also be used to probe the molecular gas in the cores of these 3 clusters, one of which (Abell 1835) already has a strong CO detection using ALMA Cycle 0 data.',\n"," 'Massive Planets and Debris Discs: How do Planetary Systems evolve in the presence of Multiple Massive Planets. We propose to image the debris disk of the ~nearby (30.1pc) >2.5Gyr-old sub-giant KIV star kCrB in band 6 to determine the disk structure at 1.5\" resolution, >7 times better than previous observations. This system hosts an Exo-Jupiter planet at 2.8au and a second massive planet (>2MJup) on a wide-orbit (a>15.8au), as well as dust disk. The proposed images will determine the architecture of the planetary belt and the radial distribution of material, which is likely being strongly influenced by the outer massive planet. Models are in place to interpret the observed structure in terms of unseen planets in the outer regions, their formation and evolution. Whilst no strong correlations have been found to exist between systems with Exo-Jupiters and those with debris belts, this has yet to be tested in detail for a system with a bright known dust belt with close-in and wide-orbit massive planets. The proximity, sub-mm brightness and mass of kCrB make it uniquely placed for studying planetary systems in the presence of multiple massive planets. Additionally, we will search for CO J=2-1 line emission within the disk, which if found would be the oldest CO Gas ever detected in a debris belt.',\n"," 'A Multicolor View of the Black Hole Environment in M87. Recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87 have revealed a ring-like structure near the event horizon at 230 GHz. This structure was interpreted as a photon ring surrounding a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and the photon capture at the event horizon. However, the origin of the ring needs to be better understood. Photons that are not entirely bound by black hole gravity, such as the emission from plasma located further away from the photon capture radius, may also contribute to the observed ring. The recent GMVA+ALMA observation of M87 in Cycle 5 at 86 GHz indicates that a ring-like structure may exist in the core of M87 at this frequency as well. Here we propose new GMVA+ALMA observations of M87 in Cycle 9, when EHT+ALMA observations at both 230 and 345 GHz are expected to be performed for the first time. These observations will provide a multicolor (3.5, 1.3, and 0.9 mm) view of the black hole environment in M87, allowing us to investigate the origin of the ring, the physical properties of plasma in the innermost accretion flows and jets, and the magnetic field structure and Faraday rotation of the ring.',\n"," 'The newly discovered G337.92 hot core: a chemical twin of Sagittarius B2(N)?. The star-forming region Sgr B2(N) is commonly seen as a key search site for new complex organic molecules (COMs). Recent analysis focusing on other star-forming regions with high degree of complexity in their chemical composition, arises questions: how widespread are these COMs? Is the molecular composition of Sgr B2(N) unique? Is there a unified view on the origin of COMs ? The recent discovery of the G337.92 hot core, which shows stricking similarities with Sgr B2(N), will allow a great step forward to address these questions. In chemically rich sources, the firm identification of (new) molecules often requires a detailed analysis of the emission lines of weakly-emitting complex molecules. We propose to use ALMA in Cycle 8 to perform a deep, unbiased imaging line survey of G337.92 at 3mm. The requested high sensitivity combined with the large frequency coverage, should allow the detection of several COMs already identified toward Sgr B2(N) but not yet in G337.92. Comparing observed abundance ratios will allow us to confirm (or not) the resemblance of the two sources and to constrain the chemical/physical processes that lead to this resemblance.',\n"," 'Tracing the Flow into Dense Cores in High-Mass Star Forming Filaments. High-mass star forming clouds often exhibit filamentary structures in which dense cores of ~<10 Msun are embedded. In order to form high-mass protostars, these dense cores must accrete gas from the environment. However direct evidence of accretion onto dense cores in filaments is rare. We have selected 8 massive filamentary clouds encompassing a variety of evolutionary phases, and obtained ALMA 12m array, VLA, and SMA data. Dense cores of ~<10 Msun are found in the filaments. Tentative signatures of accretion along (sub-)filaments and along the line of sight are found with ALMA 12m array data (using optically thick HCO+/HCN and optically thin H13CO+/NH2D lines), but missing flux (lack of short-spacing data) remains a major problem for quantitatively interpreting the accretion signatures. Here we propose to obtain the short-spacing data that are critical for solving the missing flux issue. Two critical questions will be quantitatively addressed: whether there is a correlation between accretion rates and core masses, and whether the ~<10 Msun cores will accrete enough mass to produce high-mass protostars.',\n"," 'The temperature-multiplicity relation with ALMA. Multiple protostellar systems are the most common form of star formation. Simulations suggest that heated gas hinders fragmentation, with only cold gas fragmenting. Once a protostar forms, the gas is quickly heated and further fragmentation is suppressed. Thus gas temperature has a direct impact on multiplicity. A recent survey of 12 Perseus embedded protostellar systems including single and multiple protostars, probed the cloud core gas temperature (~7000 AU) and found no correlation between gas temperature and multiplicity. However, the temperature structure can vary considerably on envelope scales (1000 AU). We therefore propose to observe the same sample of 12 embedded protostellar systems using the stand-alone ACA mode in Bands 6 and 7, targeting DCO+, H2CO and c-C3H2. These molecules trace cold, warm and UV-irradiated gas, respectively, and will produce gas temperature maps. We aim to determine if multiplicity is directly related to gas temperature on envelope scales, and its connection to the gas temperature on cloud core scales. We can determine whether the gas is warm (40K) or cold (<20K) at envelope scales, answering the relation of multiple star formation and temperature',\n"," 'What Stops Galactic Star Formation? An ALMA Study of Dense Molecular Gas in Post-Starburst Galaxies. We have identified a unique sample of post-starburst, post-merger galaxies, in transition between late- and early-types. Remarkably, we have discovered molecular gas in over half the sample, forcing these galaxies off the classical Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. In other words, they have significantly higher molecular gas surface densities than predicted by their star-formation rate (SFR) densities. Our cycle 3 ALMA observations have now constrained the CO (2-1) emission to be within only 1.5 kpc from the center in the post-starburst galaxies observed thus far. This discovery suggests a lower star formation efficiency than for normal star-forming galaxies with the same gas densities, making post-starburst galaxies a new laboratory for linking the physics of star formation on small scales to galaxy-wide trends. Only ALMA can measure the actual fuel for star formation, the denser gas traced by HCN, HCO+ and HNC, to determine what is preventing stars from forming. Here, we propose study the dense gas content of two post-starbursts with measured compact gas reservoirs.',\n"," 'Active Nuclei tori and outflows traced by CI. In recent years ALMA has revealed the presence of molecular tori of typical 10pc-scale radius in nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These molecular tori are kinematically decoupled from their galaxy disk, and are often accompanied by molecular outflows, triggered by the AGN. The tori are clumpy and may be tilted, warped and turbulent. Both tori and outflows could produce the obscuration required in type 2 AGN, but currently it is impossible to disentangle them near the AGN. To increase the spatial resolution, and follow the AGN fueling/feedback further in, other tracers must be probed. The CO molecules are progressively destroyed to the benefit of atomic carbon CI, in the X-ray dominated region close to the AGN. We propose to map in CI at higher resolution (0.05=4, 2, 14 pc) than before the gas and dust emission in three nearby AGN, which have high X-ray luminosity. Our goal is to better trace the morphology and kinematics of the torus, quantify the fueling and feedback processes. We will determine the origin of molecular outflows, better traced in CI, and confront the observations to models. The higher resolution will also permit a more precise and accurate black hole mass.',\n"," 'Unveiling the Nature of the Hot Inner Disks around Accretion Outburst YSOs. Young stellar objects (YSOs) which are undergoing accretion outbursts may be surrounded by high-density hot inner disks (HID) on a few AU scales, which are required to feed protostellar accretion at a high rate. Only very high angular resolution observations at frequencies lower than 200 GHz can probe the dust emission of HID without being significantly confused by disk structures exterior to the HID. Physical properties of the rather obscured HID can be diagnosed with SED analysis at millimeter bands, analogous to the widely applied fitting of the infrared SED to diagnose the more extended dust structures around YSOs. However, presently only ALMA long baseline observations at Band 3 and Band 4 towards nearer than 500 pc sources can provide the adequate S/N within a realistic observing time. We propose to perform a comprehensive survey towards 16 selected nearby accretion outburst YSOs. Our main goals are to characterize the mass, size, and temperature of the HIDs. The proposed observations will be of paramount importance for the understanding of the accretion outburts of YSOs, and can provide important constraints on the innermost protoplanetary disk structures in general.',\n"," 'First detection of Hydrogen recombination lines toward an ionized jet arising from a high-mass protostar. We propose to observe hydrogen recombination line (HRL) emission from the triple radio continuum source associated with IRAS 16532-3959, thought to correspond to a luminous (7.0 x 10^4 Lsun) young high-mass protostar. The triple source consists of a recently discovered central ionized jet and two outer lobes, which signpost shocks resulting from the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium. The capabilities provided by ALMA Early Science enable for the first time measurements of the kinematical and dynamical properties of jets and lobes and link their energetic properties with those of larger scale phenomena such as bipolar molecular outflows. IRAS 16532-3959 is the most massive protostar known to be associated with a collimated jet and is therefore an excellent first target to be included in the much-anticipated first round of ALMA studies of jets and outflows.',\n"," 'Molecular gas distributions in compact dusty star-forming galaxies at z=2. Recent ALMA observations of massive star-forming galaxies have revealed that the dust continuum emission is more compact than the optical continuum emission. This finding potentially suggests radially inward transport of gas (compaction), but the spatial distribution of molecular gas has been little investigated by CO observtions. We here propose to make deep 0.5\"-resolution observations of CO(3-2) emission line in six compact dusty star-forming galaxies at z=2 in JWST/NIRCam deep fields. The half-light radius of the 870 um continuum emission is less than 1 kpc. We will measure the CO sizes by the proposed observations, and threafter compare them with the 870 um and the rest-optical sizes to study the difference in the distributions of molecular gas, dust, and stars. If the CO sizes are smaller than the stellar mass sizes, it would support the compaction scenario holds, and massive galaxies will rapidly form a dense core via concentration of gas. Otherwise, the star formation efficiency would become higher, owing to dense gas in the galaxy center, thereby resulting in a compact starburst.',\n"," 'Unveiling molecular gas contents within normal star-forming galaxies at z~3.3. Star-forming galaxies at z=3-4 are expected to be in a phase of an accelerated growth towards z~2, which requires a gas inflow from the outside. Such a prominent gas inflow is also suggested from the observational results that star-forming galaxies at z>3 do not follow the same stellar mass-SFR-gas metallicity relation as galaxies at z=0-2. At z > 3, the cosmological gas inflow is likely to be dominant and hence cause the dilution of gas metallicity. In order to investigate how the inflow/outflow processes are involved in the star formation activities and interstellar medium conditions of young galaxies at z>3, it is essential to measure the molecular gas contents of these galaxies. We propose dust continuum observations at Band-6 of 12 star-forming galaxies at z~3.3, for which we have already measured gas metallicities from the Keck/MOSFIRE spectra. We estimate molecular gas masses from the dust continuum and derive gas mass fractions and star formation efficiencies by taking into account the gas metallicities. Moreover, by combining the gas metallicities, SFRs and gas mass fractions with chemical evolution models, we will constrain the inflow/outflow rates of galaxies at z~3.3.',\n"," 'Probing Accretion Flows from Filaments to Massive Star-Forming Cores. We propose to investigate filamentary accretion flows in the remarkable IRDC complexes, M17 SWex, where a delayed onset of massive star formation has been reported. Such delay may be explained by a longer accretion time for high-mass end of protostellar mass funciton. Indeed, the dense clumps in this IRDC are found to be at the convergence of multiple filaments of parsec length and display the morphology of hub-filament systems. These hubs are likely nurturing massive protostars and accrete mass through their connecting filaments. We plan to 1) determine the mass accretion rate through filaments to hubs by observing the inflow motions along filaments with N2H+ (1-0); 2) assess the fragmentation in the filaments by identifying dense cores with the N2H+ and continuum emissions; 3) estimate mass accretion onto filaments from the surroudnings by detecting infall collapse onto filaments with HNC (1-0). We will perform a mosaic of 57 fields in Band 3 to cover two hubs and their associated filaments.',\n"," 'The Atomic to Molecular Ratio and Shocks in the Circumnuclear Disk of Centaurus A. Centaurus A (NGC5128) is by far the nearest powerful radio galaxy and our best candidate for detailed studies of the ISM properties of the circumnuclear disk (CND), feeding mechanisms of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and feedback on the surrounding gas. In this proposal we aim to study the atomic and shocked gas of the CND by using the atomic [CI] fine structure line 3P1 - 3P0 (492GHz) and the shock tracers CH3OH (2K - 1K) (96 GHz) and HNCO (5 0,5 - 40,4) (109 GHz) at 10 pc resolution (~0.5), to be compared with our previous ALMA CO(3-2) and CO(6-5) maps towards the CND (Espada et al. 2017). Using APEX observations over the CND, Israel et al. (2014) found a considerably strong [CI] line compared to CO(5-4), being the ratio larger than in the majority of starburst/AGN nearby galaxies. With the observations here proposed we will: 1) investigate the properties of the atomic gas versus the molecular gas within the CND, 2) to confirm or refute the existence of an atomic outflow component that has been recently proposed (Israel et al. 2017), and 3) to study the location and properties of shocked gas as produced by non-circular motions.',\n"," 'Molecular gas streams around the intermediate-mass black hole candidates in the Galactic center. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are key objects to understand the origin of supermassive BHs (SMBHs). However, definitive evidence for IMBHs has not been obtained yet. Recently, the discovery of interesting molecular gas streams has been reported near the Galactic nucleus. These sub-pc scale streams show clear orbital motions around two invisible gravitational sources, which may be massive IMBHs or highly dense clusters mainly consisting of dark stellar remnants such as neutron stars and stellar-mass BHs. Here, we propose high-resolution (0.2 arcsec) molecular line and continuum observations toward the gas streams in ALMA band 6 and 7. The principal objective is to probe mass distribution of the putative gravitational sources and examine the IMBH hypothesis by investigating the detailed kinematics and physical conditions of the streams. We also aim to resolve mysterious ultra-compact (d<0.04 pc) clumps with extremely broad velocity widths (dV~50 km/s) located around the two IMBH candidates. This project would potentially fill the \"missing link\" between stellar mass BHs and SMBHs, contributing to further understanding of galactic evolution.',\n"," 'Probing Planet-Disk Interactions in the Fomalhaut System. The Fomalhaut system hosts both an iconic, eccentric debris disk and a hotly debated directly imaged companion, Fomalhaut b, whose orbit may pass through the disk in the future. The proximity of this system (7.7 pc) makes it a unique target to characterize dynamical interactions between a debris disk and its underlying planetary system at high spatial resolution. We propose high resolution Cycle 5 ALMA observations targeted at the pericenter and apocenter sides of the Fomalhaut debris disk to explore the nature of planet-disk interactions in the system. These new observations will allow us to (1) resolve azimuthal width variations, which will determine whether the disk is being shaped through secular perturbations by a planet, (2) identify any additional small-scale substructure in the disk, and (3) constrain whether the proposed planet, Fomalhaut b, is truly a planet or instead a dust cloud.',\n"," 'Close-up of a Globule in the Helix Nebula. High resolution imaging has shown that the Helix, one of the nearest planetary nebulae, is composed of a spectacular array of thousands of comet-like globules. Their origin is controversial, but they are known to consist of small, dense condensations of molecular gas with planet-like masses. We propose to make the first resolved observations of the molecular gas deep inside a globule of the Helix. Our observations in 12CO and 13CO (2-1) will probe the internal structure and kinematics of the core in unprecedented detail. The results will provide crucial information for evaluating theoretical models of the origin and evolution of these enigmatic objects.

Here we intend to use the advantages of ALMA in order to study one of the most readily available signatures of magnetic reconnection, microflares, in the chromosphere: the region through which the energy and plasma must flow to get into the corona. By observing the statistics of microflaring in two wavelengths, we will be able to better constrain the heights and dynamics of energy transfer in the chromosphere during magnetic reconnection.',\n"," 'When terrestrial planets collide: imaging the aftermath of an impact in the Solar neighbourhood. Terrestrial planet formation continues past the gas-rich protoplanetary phase, in 10-100 Myr-old planetary systems. This is the era of giant impacts, where embryos grow through collisions to form terrestrial planets. The HD172555 system is, to date, the only one with conclusive evidence of an impact in the Solar neighbourhood, amenable to characterization. Warm dust with the unique spectral fingerprint of an impact and the recent ALMA detection of CO gas from atmospheric stripping at 8 au inequivocably represent the leftovers of a planetary collision. We propose a deep, high-resolution (0.1\") ALMA Band 7 program to resolve the aftermath of this giant impact, measuring the spatial distribution of the debris and its molecular composition. These observables will constrain the progenitor mass, the timing since the collision and the post-impact gas chemistry of an extrasolar terrestrial impact for the first time. Through this program, we will exploit the only opportunity we have to image the aftermath of a giant impact in our Solar neighbourhood, and in doing so constrain models of planetary-scale collisions in unprecedented detail.',\n"," 'Properties of the interstellar medium around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the radio galaxy M87. The archetypal giant elliptical galaxy at the centre of the Virgo cluster, M87 (3C 274), is a unique object in which to study the origin and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in a radio galaxy located in a dense environment. CO J=1-0 emission from the molecular gas in the inner part of M87 has been detected with the IRAM-30m telescope, and the molecular gas likely resides in a circumnuclear disk-like structure. While a very well-known object across most of the electromagnetic spectrum, M87 still lacks a detailed study in the (sub)millimeter range, requiring an advance in both sensitivity and angular resolution. The unique ALMA Cycle 1 capabilities will allow us to make the first detailed investigation of the properties of the ISM around the supermassive black hole at the centre of M87. We wish to use bands 3 and 7 to map the CO J=1-0 and CO J=3-2 lines, respectively, to trace the bulk of the molecular gas and the warmer denser gas, and in addition image the continuum emission, at an angular resolution of 1 arcsecond (~80 pc). Such observations are not currently possible with any other facility and will dramatically improve our knowledge of this archetypal radio galaxy. With a small investment of ALMA time we will achieve the deepest and highest spatial resolution image yet of the molecular gas content and excitation of a giant elliptical galaxy.',\n"," 'Propagation of cosmic rays in molecular clouds interacting with a supernova remnant. Cosmic rays (CRs) are a major component of the Galaxy. Especially, since low-energy CRs lose their energy via ionization, they are believed to have a strong influence on the chemical evolution in molecular clouds and on star and planet formation. However, the influence of CRs has been discussed only hypothetically in theories because the propagation process of CRs in molecular clouds is highly unknown. A recent study noted that CR protons with E~0.01 MeV, ~10 MeV, ~GeV attribute to the ionization rate, Fe I Ka line, and Gamma-ray emission, and indicated that the relative spatial distributions among the the three observables are the key to reveal the propagation process. Actually, there are no samples where the three observables were measured in the same region. We focus on the southwestern edge of the supernova remnant W44, where both the Fe I Ka line and gamma-rays are detected. We propose DCO+ (J=2-1) and H13CO (J=1-0) observations at two positions in this region to measure the ionization rate and its spatial distribution. This observation will reveal the propagation of MeV CRs observationally for the first time.',\n"," 'SO and CCH Zeeman in IRAS 20126+4104: Measuring Magnetic Fields around a High-mass Protostar. Measuring magnetic field strengths around protostars is a crucial part of testing theories of magnetically-driven accretion. While polarization from magnetically-aligned dust grains or the Goldriech-Kylafis effect can trace the magnetic field morphology, the Zeeman effect offers a direct probe of line-of-sight magnetic field strengths. To date, ALMA has not successfully detected the Zeeman effect. To increase the chances of detecting the Zeeman effect, we propose to observe an object whose high accretion rate implies a strong magnetic field: the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126+4104. In addition to its high accretion rate, this protostar stands out as a target due to the presence of a Keplerian disk, a Zeeman-sensitive spectral line, and a previous magnetic field strength measurement with which to compare our magnetic field strengths. We plan to target eight Zeeman-sensitive SO and CCH transitions to measure magnetic field strengths in the disk, outflow cavity, and outflow of IRAS 20126+4104. These observations will test ALMAs capability to directly measure magnetic field strengths and improve our understanding of magnetic accretion in circumstellar disks.',\n"," 'Zooming into a Swift/BAT-selected buried AGN of NGC 7172 with a candidate dispersion-dominated thick gaseous disk.

Subsequent X-ray spectroscopy suggests the fractions of scattered soft X-rays w.r.t.the direct emission is only < 0.2%, an order of magnitude smaller than classical type-2 Seyferts (1 - 3%). Furthermore, our recent ~100-pc resolution ALMA observations of CO(2-1) reveal a drastic increase of the velocity dispersion to rotation velocity ratio, sigma/Vrot, a key indicator of the disk thickness, at r<100 pc of NGC 7172. These facts make NGC 7172 a promising target hosting a SMBH embedded by a geometrically thick torus with a very small opening angle. Our primary goal is to test if the CO(2-1) gas disk in NGC 7172 exhibits a high sigma/Vrot ratio beyond unity, which supports the presence of geometrically thick cold molecular material in the central ~10 pc region of a new-type AGN. We will also search for any signature of molecular outflows at r<100pc, to compare with the putative OH outflow by Herschel and ~kpc scale outflow uncovered in the previous ALMA data.',\n"," 'Shedding Light on Distant Starburst Galaxies Hosting Dust-Obscured gamma-ray Bursts. Studies of distant starburst galaxies hosting GRBs offer unique insights into extreme star-forming regions during early epochs. In particular, 25-40% of all GRBs show a suppressed optical to x-ray ratio in the afterglow. A likely explanation is that they originate in dusty galaxies, which are commonly missed in optical surveys. We have carried out a successful program in ALMA Cycle 0 to observe the galaxy hosting the dark GRB 080607 at z = 3.036. We obtained a marginal detection of its 345 GHZ continuum, placing it at the faintest end of the dusty galaxy population. This indicates that the large extinction (Av ~ 3) in the afterglow is confined along a dusty sight line, contrary to the expectation of the host galaxy itself being dusty. Here we propose to conduct a systematic study of nine galaxies hosting dust-obscured GRBs at z > 1.5 based on observations of their 345 GHz continuum. All nine galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts to confirm that the suppressed optical fluxes are indeed due to extinction, rather than IGM absorption. The proposed imaging will allow us to characterize the global dust content of the host galaxies in a broader context of the dusty galaxy population.',\n"," 'Weighing Supermassive Black Holes with ALMA. Ubiquitely present at the centres of galaxies, black holes are central to understanding galaxy evolution. However, the correlations driving most theoretical efforts (e.g. black hole mass-central velocity dispersion relation) are based on a relatively small number of measurements and only a handful of methods. Our recent work with CARMA has however shown that it is possible to dynamically estimate the mass of supermassive black holes, by simply probing the near-Keplerian rotation of molecular disks around them at high angular resolution. This is a highly promising method, and in the ALMA era it will make possible hundreds of measurements across galaxies of all morphological types. In Cycle 2, it is already possible to exploit extended array configurations to measure the black hole mass in carefully selected objects. We therefore request here high angular resolution CO(3-2) line imaging of three promising targets spanning much of the Hubble sequence: NGC4429 (SA0), NGC4861 (SAab), and NGC3351 (SBb). With these data, we will probe their molecular gas kinematics on nuclear scales, weigh their black holes, and test the reliability of our measurement method.',\n"," 'A Precision Test of Gamma-ray Burst Afterglow Models. GRBs are powered by extreme compact objects (e.g. black holes or magnetars) that eject matter at ultra-relativistic velocities (Lorentz factor >>100). This makes them ideal laboratories to study radiation processes in extreme conditions. Up to now the Swift satellite has detected >1000 GRB afterglows but only 20-30 were bright enough for extensive follow-up from radio to X-ray wavelengths to provide crucial constraints on the radiation processes. Swift has been in orbit for more than 11 years. Although all systems are still fully operational, the window to test the afterglow models gradually gets smaller. Those tests are fundamental and address key difficulties in understanding physics of cosmic particle-accelerators. Because of this, we propose a joint ALMA+JCMT+NOEMA proposal to study one GRB afterglow with a peak flux of >1 mJy from early (hours) to late times (months) for the first time. We propose to secure 5 epochs at 92 and 332 GHz separated by 7-14 days in each band. We will complement these observations with X-ray to radio data to model the broadband afterglow. This allows us to precisely test models and characterise non-standard radiation components.',\n"," 'Search for Submillimeter H2O Maser Towards Active Galactic Nuclei. We propose to search for submillimeter H2O masers towards active galactic nuclei (AGN). Galaxies in our sample are listed from known 22 GHz \"disk\" masers showing the presence of a sub-parsec scale disk or characteristic spectra. These sample galaxies show the strongest flux density of the 22 GHz H2O maser among about 150 H2O extragalactic masers known to date. Our primary aim of this program is 1) to study distribution of temperature and density in sub-parsec scale regions of AGN by detecting different transitions of submillimeter (submm) H2O masers at 22 GHz, 183 GHz, 321 GHz, and 325 GHz. First of all, we need to detect the 321/325 GHz transition in this Cycle 0 program. Since the pumping mechanism of these transitions is similar, we might be able to discover the new submm H2O maser in the largely same region and in the same galaxies as the 22 GHz maser exists, or new masers could be potentially detected in unexplored region of AGN, 2) by monitoring the line of sight velocity of the maser, we aim to detect systemic accelerations, assuming the submm maser lying on a rotating disk. Also, we aim the first detection of the accelerations of the maser on the back side of the disk. We have more chance to detect it since submm continuum emission obscuring the maser on the back side could become optically thin. This will confirm the generally accepted rotation disk model, and 3) to provide the line intensity ratio between the transitions, which will be critical for developing the numerical simulation, based on radiative transfer model.',\n"," 'Probing the star formation process and dark matter halos of superthin galaxies. We here propose to map the molecular gas in a complete sample of nearby massive superthin galaxies. Superthin galaxies are spiral galaxies that exhibit extraordinarily large disk axial ratios (>10) and no discernible bulge component. The formation of such object in the hierarchical LamdaCDM context is not well understood, and these observations will shed light on two of the biggest ongoing controversies. Firstly, we will determine the efficiency of star formation in such systems. They are predicted to form stars very efficiently thanks to the low dynamical stability of their gas discs (caused by the razor thin nature of their stellar discs), but yet have somehow retained their gas and low surface brightness stellar discs for a Hubble time. Secondly, we will dynamically determine the shape of the dark matter halo profile in the inner parts of these objects, which are expected to be extremely dark matter dominated. In summary, a short investment of ALMA time will allow us to probe the impact of stellar structure on star formation, and reveal the dark matter halo properties of these enigmatic objects.',\n"," 'What is Carving the Gaps in Young, Embedded Disks?. Protoplanetary disks with ages of 1-5 Myr are often found with large holes in their centers. These \"transition\" disks are hypothesized to be carved out by planets hiding in the inner regions of the disk, and indeed some evidence has been found for planets hiding in such gaps. In our ALMA Cycles 3 & 4 observations of young (<0.5 Myr) embedded disks, we found several cases of embedded protostars that have a large cavities in their disk as well. However, our existing observations are insufficient to determine the underlying cause of these holes, whether it be large bodies such as planets or protostars, dust grain growth, or photoevaporation. Here we propose to observe a sample of 7 Class 0/I \"transition disks\" in continuum and gas lines to determine the clearing mechanism. Planets, multiplicity, dust grain growth, and photoevaporation each leave a distinct imprint on the dust and gas, and our proposed observations will have the power to distinguish between each scenario. If planets could be shown to be carving this hole, it would place very strong constraints on the timescales on which planet formation begins.',\n"," 'After the Fall: Mapping the Molecular Fuel in Post-Starburst Galaxies. To explain the nature of present day galaxies, contemporary models of galaxy evolution require feedback to expel a substantial fraction of the gas and dust fueling stellar and black hole growth, driving galaxies into quiescence. Post-starburst galaxies are systems found precisely in this phase - shortly after star formation has been abruptly halted - but little is known about the dust and gas content of these systems. We have recently discovered surprisingly large reservoirs of dust and molecular gas in a sample of post-starbursts. Incredibly, they are producing stars at a pace more than 10x below what is expected. A critical question is why this gas is not forming stars in line with the well-studied SF law. To understand the fate of molecular fuel after quenching, we propose deep CO 2-1 mapping of 8 post-starbursts with well-measured molecular gas and dust masses, sampling a wide range of precisely determined post-burst ages from 0.3-1.5Gyr. Continuum measurements at 1.3mm will also provide powerful contraints on cold dust content. ALMA alone has the sensitivity and resolution needed to probe the state of the dusty molecular fuel left behind in galaxies After the Fall.',\n"," 'Establishing the Best Tracers of Molecular Outflows Across Redshift and Galaxy Properties. One of the most important realizations of the last fifteen years is the vital role that feedback must play in the evolution of galaxies. Large-scale galactic winds driven by supernovae and/or AGN are often invoked as the means by which feedback occurs. In Cycle 4, we detected massive molecular outflows in several z~4-5.5 dusty galaxies seen in blueshifted absorption of the OH 119um line, the \"gold standard\" tracer of molecular winds. Due to its high rest frequency, however, this line is difficult to observe at z<4. Here, we propose to establish the effectiveness of two alternative molecular outflow tracers which can be observed with ALMA across essentially all redshifts. Previous observations of these lines have shown a variety of outcomes, from non-detections to full P Cygni profiles, but it is unclear whether the wind non-detections are due to geometric effects or because the lines are not useful tracers. By targeting systems with known winds, we can determine which line is the most faithful tracer in comparison to OH 119um, the best available diagnostic. Finally, due to their formation pathways, the molecules we target will allow us to constrain the wind driving mechanism.',\n"," 'ColdSINS: an ALMA cold gas census of the deepest near-IR IFU+AO sample of z~2 star-forming galaxies. We propose a census of the cold gas content from sensitive ALMA 870um continuum observations of 35 z~2 galaxies from SINS/zC-SINF, the deepest and highest resolution near-IR IFU sample in existence. This sample, probing the star-forming galaxy population over two orders of magnitude in mass, has exquisite 0.15\" resolution AO-assisted SINFONI data of the Halpha+[NII] line emission and deep HST near-IR imaging, giving maps of the kinematics, star formation, metallicities, outflows, stellar light and mass on ~1kpc scales. These substantial campaigns (650 VLT hours + 126 HST orbits) led to several breakthroughs that helped shape our current understanding of galaxy evolution. For a modest 15.0 hrs investment, ColdSINS will obtain the first direct constraints on the mass and extent of the cold gas in these galaxies at high sensitivity (RMS=0.05mJy) and ~0.9\" resolution. This knowledge is also prerequisite to future high-resolution ALMA follow-ups. This is a resubmission of a Cycle 6 proposal ranked in the top quartile but not scheduled due to oversubscription. We will provide the community with the reduced ALMA data, complementing the already released reduced SINFONI+AO sets.',\n"," 'Testing the cold ISM removal mechanism in passive galaxies. One of the key issues lacking in our understanding of cosmic dust is how galaxies are getting rid of it. It is tricky to track dust removal, because usually dust is constantly replenished by consecutive generations of stars. In order to overcome this we selected dusty passive galaxies, which still have detectable dust content, but exhibit a low current supernova dust production (and destruction) rate due to the long time since the last major star formation event. Therefore any decline of dust content as a function of their age can be attributed to dust removal. We found that their dust and gas content declines rapidly at ages > 2 Gyr, allowing us to constrain the timescale of the ISM removal in these galaxies. However, an important aspect of the nature of this mechanism needs to be tested: is the removal of the ISM due to outflows or do we detect the effect of heating of gas, which destroys dust and molecular gas? Distinguishing this would allow us to understand how passive galaxies are getting rid of the ISM, and we plan to achieve this via high-resolution CO(1-0) observations to look for signatures of outflows.',\n"," 'Direct Measurement of Inner and Outer Disk Misalignment. Results from the Kepler mission suggest that exoplanetary systems are divided into two distinct populations - one with coplanar planets, and one with planets that have significant mutual inclinations (the \"Kepler Dichotomy\"). One explanation for this phenomenon is that dynamical processes may force planets into orbits with high mutual inclinations. These planets may interact with the disk and generate a misaligned disk structure, or vice-versa. Theory has long suggested the presence of dynamically generated disk misalignments, and recent scattered light observations with SPHERE provide indirect evidence for such systems via inner disk shadows. Recent ALMA observations show similar evidence for a misalignment in the AA Tau disk, with symmetric shadows visible in the innermost dust ring. Bright inner disk emission provides a unique opportunity to directly measure the inner and outer disk misalignment angle by observing the disk at high angular resolution and resolving its geometry. These observations will provide the first direct measurement of a disk misalignment, confirming the hypothesized phenomenon and providing a benchmark system for theoretical dynamical models.',\n"," 'Resolved, Spatially Complete Maps of Dense Gas Tracers in LMC Clouds. We request 11.1h of main array time to obtain sensitive (64mK) 12m+7m+tp maps of the emission from Band 3 dense gas tracers at 1pc+0.8km/s resolution across the full CO-emitting extent of five molecular clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our target clouds have existing ALMA maps of the CO isotopologues and span a range of star formation activity. We will use the data to study the spatial organization and velocity field of the dense gas within each cloud, the distributions of intensity, linewidth and line profile shape parameters for each tracer, and their relationship to the physical properties of CO-emitting structures. The proposed maps will build a bridge between highly resolved Galactic work and kpc-scale results from more distant systems, a key to understanding the physics that drives extragalactic scaling laws relating `dense gas and star formation.',\n"," 'Mapping out the Changing Dust Properties of High-redshift Galaxies. ALMA has by now firmly established the importance and ubiquity of dust at high redshift (z > 5). However, our understanding of the physical properties of the earliest dust in galaxies remains severely limited by the scarcity of multi-band follow-up, and the few existing multi-band studies focusing solely on observations near the peak of the dust SED. Crucially, this leaves the dust emissivity index (beta) fully unconstrained, preventing any insight into the composition and size distribution of high-z dust grains, as well as introducing major systematic uncertainties in our knowledge of dust temperatures (+/- 30 K), masses and luminosities (> 0.5 dex). We here propose for Band 4 + 9 observations of 5 normal star-forming galaxies at 5 < z < 7.5 with existing multi-band ALMA data in order to 1) robustly measure dust emissivity indices in the first Gyr of cosmic time, and 2) accurately constrain dust temperatures and masses of high-z galaxies free from systematic uncertainties. With these observations, we will elucidate if galaxy dust properties evolve across cosmic time, and shed new light on the rate and efficiency of dust build-up in the early Universe.',\n"," 'What drives the formation of super-Jeans cores?. Interstellar filaments represent a key stage towards the formation of stars. As they become gravitationally unstable, filaments fragment into cores, the direct progenitors of stars. The typical Jeans mass of such filaments is about a solar mass. This raises the question about the formation and support meachnism of super-Jeans cores, i.e. cores that are several time more massive than the Jeans mass. A local increase of the gas velocity dispersion (i.e. turbulence) is a commonly invoked physical mechanism to support such Super-Jeans cores against gravity and further fragmentation. We propose to use ALMA to observe apparently starless, super-Jeans cores of the SDC13 infrared dark cloud. We see local increases of the gas velocity dispersion for 20 out of the 32 detected cores. We aim to understand how these local peaks in velocity dispersion manifest, and what are the consequences on the formation of intermediate-/high-mass stars.',\n"," 'Mapping the Star Formation in SPT0311-58. We request a deep, sub-kpc resolution map of the OIII 88um line emission from a unique system of dusty galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). SPT0311-58 is a system of massive interacting galaxies at z=6.900 that was found via their millimeter-wavelength dust emission in the South Pole Telescope survey. In previous cycles we have shown these galaxies to reside in an extremely massive dark matter halo, reconstructed the spatial/velocity structure of the galaxy pair through a pixelated lens modeling technique, and measured their dust, gas, and stellar content. We now have <0.1\"-resolution images of this system in both continuum and the 158um CII line, which show the two main galaxies to be composed of clumpy high-velocity-dispersion regions of star formation. We propose to augment these maps with the high-ionization OIII line, which should emit only in regions of active star formation and around accreting black holes. With OIII, CII, and continuum information we will explore the distribution of star formation in z~7 galaxies, trace the assembly history of these objects, and better understand the utility of the OIII line for future observations of even higher redshift galaxies.',\n"," 'A Molecular ALMA Deep Field in the UDF. To date, our understanding of the molecular gas content in high-redshift galaxies is fundamentally limited by pre-selection of the galaxies at other wavelengths (optical/NIR/IR, sub-millimeter, radio). To overcome this, we propose an unbiased molecular deep field (CO spectral scan of band 3, covering all z>1) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We will reach a molecular mass limit that is an order of magnitude deeper than previously possible, below the expected knee of the CO luminosity function. We expect to detect >20 galaxies (both in line and continuum) and these detections will be compared to (1) our detailed SED modeling of all galaxies in the UDF (2) our analytic-empirical models that build on our current understanding of high-redshift molecular gas and (3) the latest adaptive moving mesh cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include molecular gas. Stacking (both 2D and 3D) will push the statistical detection of sources to unprecedented depths. In summary, we will put unbiased observational constraints on the redshift-dependent CO luminosity function and meaningfully constrain the cosmic evolution of the universal molecular gas density for the first time.',\n"," 'Large scale infall or local collapse forms massive clusters?. The origin of the distribution of stellar masses, in particular of massive stars, is one of the most fundamental open questions of modern astrophysics. Whether they form by a high-level of supersonic micro-turbulence, converging flows or large-scale global collapse is still not settled. We therefore aim here at an unprecedentedly complete view on the kinematics of star forming gas towards the recently discovered most pristine massive clump known to date, G23.21-0.38, based on the ATLASGAL 870 micron survey and its spectroscopic follow-ups. Using high density cold gas tracers (HNC, HCO+, HN13C) we want to look for signatures of global collapse initiated on large scale (>35), converging flows, and compare the kinematics with the location of dense cores on small scales (2). The targeted source is entirely dominated by cold gas on a 6 pc scale, and we have strong evidence for a deeply embedded high-mass protostar exhibiting class II methanol maser emission, broad outflow wings, and a particularly high mass infall rate towards its center. We aim to reveal whether local or global collapse sets in first for forming rich clusters.',\n"," 'Revealing planet migration via dust substructures in isolated outer disks. Planets are thought to migrate as they grow and evolve in their parent protoplanetary disk, due to the balance of gravitational and pressure torques. Migration is commonly invoked to explain the existence of hot Jupiters and the concentration of low-mass exoplanets at small orbital radii. In general, several processes can influence the rate of planet migration, and result in both inward or outward drifts. But there is little observational evidence of migration beyond the empirical motivation found in the Solar System. Using ALMA, we found signatures of planet migration via dust structures in the outer region of a gapped disk. HD169142 has a system of three fine rings with asymmetric mutual separations. A single low mass planet can account for the triple ring structure, while its inward migration naturally explains the rings mutual separations. Here, we aim to explore whether the observation in HD169142 is a rare anecdote, or if it reflects a universal phenomenon in gapped disks outer regions. We will test for low-mass planet signatures in HD97048, whose outer region shows hints of a tripple-ring that can be used to inform on the radial migration of the embedded perturber.',\n"," 'Spatially resolving the CO excitation in a lensed, normal star-forming galaxy at z=1.7. CO observations are widely used to assess the molecular gas content of galaxies. At high-redshift, only the higher CO transitions are accessible at submillimeter wavelengths. The CO excitation ladder needed to convert such measurements to a molecular gas mass is very poorly understood, with up to an order of magnitude uncertainty in the conversion factor for high-J lines. Recent observations and numerical simulations are finding a correlation between CO excitation and star formation surface density, with much higher excitations for massive star-forming clumps with high SF surface densities. We propose observations of the CO(3-2), CO(6-5) and CO(8-7) transition for an exceptionally bright lensed galaxy at z=1.7. Together with proposed CO(1-0) observations from the eVLA, the extreme magnification and extent of the arc will allow us to spatially resolve the excitation ladder over multiple clumps and interclump regions, even at moderate resolution of 1.5\". This will be the first spatially resolved observation of CO excitation in a normal star-forming galaxy at high redshift and a direct test of current theoretical models',\n"," 'Velocity and density power spectra along the Musca filament: Hints to the origin of the star formation properties. There is a growing evidence of the key role of molecular filaments in the star formation process. Important questions are to understand the physical processes 1) leading to the fragmentation of these filaments into bound cores and 2) governing the properties of these cores (e.g., mass distribution and angular momentum). Recent theoretical studies suggest that the fragmentation of a self-gravitating filament characterized by a velocity power spectrum with a slope of -5/3 (i.e., a Kolmogorov spectrum) may be at the origin of the observed mass distribution of cores and their angular momentum. Here we propose ACA band 3 and 6 observations to trace the molecular emission of C18O(1-0) and (2-1) along Musca, a low-mass filament at the verge of gravitational fragmentation, to derive for the first time its velocity power spectrum and test the theoretical models. Thanks to the two C18O transitions we will also have the required data to constrain the density and temperature of Musca and derive an accurate estimate of the line-of-sight depth to constrain the 3D structure of the Musca cloud: cylindrical filament or sheet-like.',\n"," 'Unveiling the population of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies with ALMA 1.2 mm imaging. Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are dusty star-forming galaxies at high-z that directly trace the most intense episodes of stellar mass build-up in massive galaxies. Despite the large progress in understanding their properties, all we currently know about SMGs is severely affected by the biases imposed by the traditional radio/IR counterpart identification methods. We propose to perform ALMA 1.2 mm continuum imaging of a complete, flux-limited sample of 129 SMGs in the COSMOS field. These observations will allow us to find unambiguous counterparts and thus perform a critical, unbiased analysis of the SMG properties. Taking advantage of the unprecedented multi-wavelength and photometric redshift coverage of the COSMOS field, this will provide a legacy sample to study the cosmic evolution, dust properties, masses and environments of SMGs. Most importantly, we will quantify the intrinsic redshift distribution, providing a conclusive measurement to the abundance of SMGs at z>4. Finally, this study will illuminate the homogeneity or diversity of the SMG population, possibly changing our view of their evolution and role in the formation of massive ellipticals.',\n"," 'Characterizing the volcanic contribution in Ios atmosphere. Jupiters moon Io possesses a tenuous SO2-dominated atmosphere that feeds the plasma torus in orbit around Jupiter, hence requiring a continuous replenishment mechanism. While the primary origin of the gas is volcanic, it is unclear whether the bulk atmosphere is directly supplied by the volcanic plumes, or if it is mainly sustained by sublimation of SO2 frosts. The volcanic gas composition itself, that depends on the magma composition and the volcanic conduit conditions, is not known. The purpose of this proposal is to bring new constraints on the contribution of volcanism to Ios atmosphere. A chemical search for expected yet undetected volcanic species such as SiO, KCl, S2O and CO is proposed, with an unprecedented sensitivity, aiming at constraing the ionian volcanic regimes. Maps of the main atmospheric species (SO2, SO and NaCl) will be obtained with the best resolution ever achieved at this wavelength (0.3\"), in order to correlate the gas distribution with potential sources (volcanic centers, frost patches), as well as to verify the presence of SO2 in cold, polar regions where sublimation is neglectable. In addition, a map of the wind-field will be obtained by measuring Doppler-shifts on the strongest SO2 lines. This will allow to verify if the wind circulation follows a day-to-night pattern, that would be expected in the case of a sublimation sustained atmosphere, or if the circulation is zonal, as was observed by our team on IRAM observations of much lesser quality.',\n"," 'Into the Mystic: testing the role of ionizing feedback in regulating star formation. Feedback plays a critical but poorly understood role in regulating star formation. Momentum injected by photoionization of fresh material off of cloud surfaces has recently been recognized to play an important role in the evolution and eventual destruction of molecular clouds. This may compress the gas, fostering star formation or drive turbulence, preventing collapse. Theoretical models predict measurable differences in the kinematics and star formation efficiencies in feedback-altered gas. We propose to map the Mystic Mountains, a heavily irradiated complex of dust pillars in the Carina Nebula to measure the kinematics of gas subject to intense stellar feedback. Using the ACA in stand-alone mode, we will measure the distribution of (1) turbulence as a function of distance from the ionization front and (2) protostars forming within the cloud complex. These observations also allow us to constrain pillar formation models and estimate the cloud destruction timescale. Together with observations of the cold gas kinematics in less extreme regions, these data allow us to constrain the role of ionizing feedback in regulating star formation.',\n"," 'Testing the SFE bimodality: measuring the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in ULIRGs using 13CO. Local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are gas and dust-rich major mergers hosting strong starbursts. They have star-formation efficiencies (SFE) much higher than main-sequence galaxies and indeed the existence of a SFE bimodality has been suggested based on these differences. The SFE of ULIRGs relies on the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (alpha_CO) assumed for ULIRGs, ~4 times lower than the standard Galactic alpha_CO. Warmer, denser, and more turbulent ISM in ULIRGs could justify a reduced CO optical depth and, hence, a reduced alpha_CO. However, the nuclear gas column densities in ULIRGs are very high and recent spatially resolved ALMA data suggest highly suppressed 12CO emission in, at least, some ULIRGs, which would be at odds with a reduced alpha_CO. We propose to observe the optically thinner 13CO isotopologue in a representative sample, in terms of interaction stage and nuclear 12CO emission suppression (from flat-top to Gaussian-like line profiles), of ULIRGs (10 new + 2 archive). We will determine the nuclear optical depths using radiative transfer models and estimate their alpha_CO, which is key to establish their SFE and the existence (or not) of a bimodal SFE.',\n"," 'Molecules in supernova 1987A - chemistry, nucleosynthesis and gas dynamics. Supernovae (SNe) are the main source of chemical enrichment in galaxies. SN 1987A was the nearest SN explosion detected in 400 years. Since its discovery, SN 1987A has given us remarkable insights into the physics and chemistry of SNe. Our ALMA Cycle-0 detected molecular line emission in the SN ejecta, thus opened up an exciting new avenue of observational research, molecular astronomy in SNe. In this cycle-2 programme we propose an unbiased line survey of SN 1987A from 210 to 350 GHz. We aim to detect new species of molecules that have been predicted to form in SN ejecta, and to measure the emission from the isotopologues of these molecules, as well as their velocity profiles, densities and temperatures. Measurements of molecular isotopologue ratios will allow us to measure isotope ratios of C, O, S, Si. This will provide direct constraints on stellar yields from SN nuclosynthesis. These measurements of abundances for species other than CO and SiO will constrain not only chemical models. We will also measure the line profiles from different molecular species, tracing turbulent structure that resulted from the hydrodynamical instabilities caused by the SN explosion.',\n"," 'The Chemistry of Planet Formation. Planets form and obtain their compositions in dust and gas-rich disks around young stars. The planet forming process is intimately linked to the disk chemical structure. First, chemistry shapes the outcome of planet formation, including planetary hospitality to life. Second, the chemistry is sensitive to the distribution of dust and pebbles in disks, and as planets open up disk gaps they may change the chemical environment within which they form. Third, molecular emission is often the only tool we have to explore disk ionization levels, kinematics and mass distribution, all key ingredients of planet formation models. We propose a Large Program to map out the radial and vertical disk chemical structures at 10 au scales, in five disks where dust sub-structure is detected and planet formation appears to be ongoing. The resulting data will give us access to the chemistry in the planet forming zone of disks, explore how ongoing planet formation shape the disk chemistry environment, and constrain the disk gas properties in the previously unexplored inner disk midplane.',\n"," 'Chemical Composition of Molecular Clouds in the Nearby Metal-Poor Galaxy NGC6822. In metal-poor environments, chemical compositions of molecular clouds are different from that in our Galaxy. Based on our recent observations of the three low-metallicity galaxies, the LMC, IC10, and NGC6822, with the single dish telescopes, we found characteristic features of chemical compositions in metal-poor environments. Those are enhancement of CCH and deficiency of CH3OH, both of which originate from the low abundance of dust grains. This result would constitute an important base for studying chemical compositions of low-metallicity galaxies including distant galaxies, and hence, detailed verifications are necessary. In the above observations, the distances to IC10 and NGC6822 are much different from that of the LMC. For fair comparison of the molecular-cloud scale chemical compositions among these galaxies, we need to observe IC10 and NGC6822 at a high angular resolution. In this program, we observe NGC6822 in various molecular lines in Band 3 to derive the 10 pc scale chemical composition, which can be compared directly with the LMC result. Considering the growing importance of astrochemistry in extragalactic studies, our program is of fundamental importance.',\n"," 'Massive molecular outflows and negative feedback in active galaxies. We have recently found unambiguous evidence for massive molecular outflows in the Herschel-PACS OH spectra of a large number of nearby active galaxies. These outflows may represent the long sought evidence for the strong QSO mode feedback onto the host galaxy required by galaxy evolution models. Here we propose to use ALMA to study the same molecular outflows in 4 of our best Herschel targets by detecting and resolving the associated broad wings in CO(1-0). These observations will provide the necessary information on the geometry and size of the outflows to calibrate and test the assumptions made in the modeling of the Herschel OH spectra, which are of low spatial resolution. Combined, these data will allow us to determine the outflow rate and kinetic energy of these massive molecular winds and to derive the dominant mechanism driving them. They will also be extremely useful for the interpretation of future ALMA OH observations in the high redshift Universe.',\n"," 'Resolving molecular outflows in nearby luminous AGN from the CARS survey. We propose deep ALMA CO(1-0) line mapping at a resolution of 0.6\" for a sub-sample of 6 luminous nearby AGN from the spatially-resolved multi-wavelength Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). Recent wide-field optical IFU spectroscopy with MUSE revealed the presence of ionized outflows on kpc scales around those AGN, given the presence of broad line wings with 300-900km/s FWHM. The ionized gas outflow rates are about one solar mass per year, close to the total star formation rate of these systems. Single-dish mm observations indicate a large overall cold gas content, but the integrated CO(1-0) spectra are dominated by quiescent, galaxy-spanning gas. ALMA observations are needed to 1) resolve the corresponding molecular outflows, thereby properly constraining the total outflowing gas mass and 2) study the spatially resolved star formation efficiency to test whether star formation is suppressed or enhanced due to the AGN, relative to control samples of galaxies drawn from CALIFA survey. Understanding the properties of AGN-driven outflows in these intermediate luminosity AGN is essential to link the closest low-luminosity AGN studied in detail and the powerful QSOs at higher redshift.',\n"," 'Probing photoevaporation in protoplanetary disks: the primordial to debris disk transition. Understanding the evolution of circumstellar disks around young stellar objects is crucial for theories of star and planet formation. Most young stellar objects are either accreting classical T Tauri stars with \"full\" disks or non-accreting weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTSs) with bare stellar photospheres, which implies that the transition phase between the two states must be very short. Currently, the only mechanism able to consistently explain the rapidly vanishing disks is photoevaporation by EUV/FUV or X-ray radiation. The photoevaporation of circumstellar gas is expected to mark the transition from the primordial to the debris disk stage. The objects most likely to be caught in this crucial disk evolution phase are WTTSs with weak levels of IR excesses. Such objects represent 20% of the WTTSs population, but the dust and gas content in their disks remain unknown. Here we propose to obtain deep continuum and CO line observations of 22 WTTS in 3 nearby (d ~ 160 pc) star-forming regions (Taurus, Lupus-Scorpius, and Chameleonis) in order to: 1) Conclusively distinguish between primordial photoevaporating disks from young debris disks for the first time in a sample of WTTSs, 2) Constrain disk photoevaporation rates by measuring the mass of primordial disks with photoevaporation-induced inner holes, which is key to test the predictions of different photoevaporation models (e.g., EUV, FUV, and X-ray photoevaporation), and 3) Constrain models of the early evolution of debris disks and the onset of the debris disk phenomenon.',\n"," 'Mapping Zeeman sensitive moleculaes in the Orion Filament with the ACA. Magnetic fields have been recognized to be of increading dynamical importance in molecular clouds, particularly in star forming regions. However, the only way to measure the magnetic field strength is through the Zeeman effect, which is challenging given the large sensitivity required. Thus, a first step is to find the strongest compact spots of emission from Zeeman sensitive molecules. Here we propose to map the SO and CN Zeeman sensitive molecules, along with continuum, with the ACA in selected regions of the Orion Filament.',\n"," 'Resolving atomic gas in the accretion flow surrounding Sgr A*. The Galactic center uniquely provides the opportunity to resolve the accretion flow onto the supermassive black hole on scales less than 5 pc. Our previous GBT-100m and SMA observations of molecular lines have revealed that the well-known 2-4 pc Galactic circumnuclear disk (CND) may consist of a convergence of several >2 pc scale molecular gas streams. The ionized mini-spiral arms in the inner ~1 pc radius further indicate that a portion of these molecular gas streams may penetrate inside the CND. However, the previous 22\" resolution OI line observations suggested that the ionized mini-spiral arms may be merely the ionized rim of the ~10 times more massive atomic gas streams. With this proposal, we seek to take advantage of the new CI observation capability of ALMA Band 8, to resolve these atomic gas streams at subarcsecond resolution. The aim of this proposal is to unveil detailed morphology and kinematics of the atomic accretion flows for the first time, and by using both the spatial distribution and the observed velocity field of the atomic gas, we will diagnose how it survives the ionizing flux when approaching the central OB cluster and the black hole.',\n"," 'Mapping the hot atmospheres of evolved stars. Shocks, convection and stellar activity have a major impact on the circumstellar chemistry and mass loss of evolved AGB stars. Surface and extended atmosphere studies of these stars have so far been limited to the visual to near-infrared wavelength ranges, with limited imaging capabilities, or the marginal resolving power offered at radio wavelengths. Using ALMA long baselines, we have resolved exquisit details of the stellar atmosphere of W Hya and Mira. For W Hya we show numerous hotspots close to the actual stellar photosphere, and a hot gas layer with temperature >5000 K. This firmly proves the existence of a (likely shock-heated) chromosphere that shows stellar activity. Only ALMA can image this activity, as at other wavelengths opacity sources limit our view on the stellar surface. Here we propose to map the stellar disk structure of W Hya and R Leo across three ALMA bands. Such observations are crucial for modeling the structure of AGB atmospheres, as our current results challenge almost all available models that underlie our understanding of AGB mass loss.',\n"," 'Investigating a bottleneck in the phosporous cycle, and a search for active volcanism on Venus. Venus hosts an extremely dense, dry, CO2 and sulphur-rich atmosphere, believed to be influenced by volcanic outgassing, yet evidence for present-day (active) volcanism on Venus is scarce. We propose to use the ACA to perform two related studies of Venuss atmosphere, to address its origin, evolution, composition and habitability. Our first objective is to observe the chloride salts NaCl and KCl as direct probes of active volcanic outgassing. Our second objective is to detect the PO and PS molecules to quantify the phosphorous budget in the upper atmosphere, thereby elucidating possible chemical pathways to phosphine (PH3) - a theorized biomarker.',\n"," 'The Origin of [C II] and [N II] Emission in High-z Dusty Starbursts. Far-IR [C II] 158 micron line and the [N II] 122 & 205 micron lines are important ISM cooling transitions that are becoming popular probes for studying high redshift galaxies as a result of the advent of ALMA high frequency performance (Bands 8, 9, & 10). While they are commonly used as tracers of cold gas and SFR, they both arise in relative low density ionized gas in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies and are subject o complications due to variations in radiation field, metallicity, ionization, and gas accretion/ejection. The physical properties gas emitting these FIR lines are even less well understood. We propose to a high resolution, deep imaging study of 3 strongly lensed dusty star forming galaxies at z=2-3 with the requisite spatial information and probe the physical and kinematic properies of the gas emitting the bulk of the [C II] and [N II] lines.',\n"," 'Testing the high-z main-sequence paradigm with ALMA : from disk instability to clumps, bulge formation and quenching. Evidence has emerged that galaxy-internal processes such as disk instabilities in gas-rich star-forming galaxies play an important role in the early evolution of massive galaxies. We propose to constrain these processes with deep, spatially resolved ALMA CO and [CI] observations of BX610, a \"normal\" massive (~1e11 Msun) main-sequence z=2.21 disk galaxy with prominent star-forming clumps and a massive stellar bulge. We will study the cold gas distribution and kinematics for BX610, whose stellar and ionized gas structure/kinematics have been well determined from 0.2\" resolution VLT and HST data. The deep CO (4-3) and [CI](1-0) observations will explore the relation between the gas mass and star formation activity on 1-kpc scales across the disk to investigate the star formation process at z~2 on clump scales. Kinematic analysis of the resolved structures will help to constrain the origin of the clumps, and test the disk instability paradigm that may explain the observed disk galaxies at high-z and the formation of bulges that could transform galaxies into quiescence.',\n"," 'Dust Polarization in Young Protostellar Disks: Constraints on Dust Grain Growth. We propose a multi-wavelength dust polarization study of three young protostellar systems in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. These protostars have large, bright disks that show signatures of dust scattering from previous Cycle 3 polarization observations in Band 6. We will observe the disks at resolutions of ~ 0.25 arcsec (~30 au) in dust polarization in each of Band 7, Band 5, and Band 4. With these observations, we will resolve the polarization structure of each disk over multiple beams. The multiple wavelengths are key to trace different dust grain sizes in the disk and different optical depths. We will use models of dust scattering and grain alignment to characterize the polarization signatures and to constrain the dust grain sizes in these young disks. Grain growth in disks is an important question for disk evolution and planet formation, but it is not well understood. Dust scattering offers an unique opportunity to constrain grain sizes robustly. We will apply this method to a sample of young disks and compare these results to previous techniques.',\n"," 'The Eris-Dysnomia system: the key to understanding planet formation. The classical theory of slow pairwise accretion has been used for more than 40 years to explain the formation of planetesimals.Recent developments, however, have suggested that large bodies instead form directly from gravitational collapse after concentration in turbulent eddies or in streaming instabilities. Unfortunately,observational tests for distinguishing these possibilities have been ambiguous. Here we propose observations which could directly show that Eris, the most massive known dwarf planet, formed promptly through gravitational collapse. The key to this observation is measuring the density of Eris satellite Dysnomia. Measuring the size of Dysnomia is now a straightforward ALMA observation. Measuring the mass is possible through a carefully designed program to make precise measurements of the reflex motion of Eris as Dysnomia orbits it. ALMA is uniquely capable of the providing the measurements required. With these quick observations we have the potential to answer one of the most fundamental modern questions about the early stages of planet formation, with applicability to planetary systems throughout the universe.',\n"," 'A Complete Continuum Imaging Survey of Strongly-Lensed, High-Redshift Starbursts. From the South Pole Telescopes 2500 sq. degree survey of the southern sky, we have constructed a catalog of 81 strongly lensed high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). These sources were selected at 1.4 mm and have complete APEX/LABOCA, Herschel/SPIRE, PACS, and Spitzer/IRAC imaging, and ALMA 3mm spectroscopy. ALMA has already measured the spectroscopic redshifts for nearly all of these sources. ALMA high resolution 870 micron images have allowed the creation of reliable lens models for slightly over half of the sample. These lens models provide a wealth of information about the background source, including the magnifications and intrinsic source properties. This proposal represents the completion of this source catalog by requesting 870 micron imaging for the final 16 sources. In order to decrease the overhead fractions, we include an additional 23 sources as fillers, which will benefit from higher resolution imaging. This adds 40 min of on-source time without additional overheads, bringing the total request time to 3.58 hours. The completion of this catalog will provide a window into the nature of DSFGs and be an invaluable source for the broader ALMA community.',\n"," 'Understanding disk substructures: relating the inner and outer parts of protoplanetary disks. We propose to observe 33 protoplanetary disks around nearby (<200 pc) young stars that have been fully characterized with high-resolution spectroscopy, from the ultraviolet to the infrared, as part of the HST/ULLYSES and VLT/PENELLOPE large programs. Our primary goal is to detect disk structures in the ALMA continuum in order to unveil their origin by comparing their morphology with the properties of the inner disk (mass accretion rates, winds/outflows) estimated from their spectra, critically testing different disk evolution models. The addition of ALMA to this multi-wavelength, multi-technique observational effort will provide a holistic view of the inner and outer disk in order to obtain, for the first time, observational evidence that links dust structures to inner disk properties for a significantly large well-characterized sample of young stars in different star-forming regions. This comprehensive dataset can then be used as a benchmark sample in population studies. The data obtained from this proposal will be immediable available to the community.',\n"," 'The Molecular Gas Content in the NGC 5044 Group. The NGC 5044 group is the best candidate for studying star formation in an AGN-perturbed cooling flow due to its proximity and extensive multi-frequency coverage. Our ALMA cycle 0 observation of N5044 in CO(2-1) detected 24 molecular structures. Based on the molecular masses and CO linewidths, these structures are probably giant molecular associations and not individual GMCs. In cycle 4, we successfully proposed for higher spatial resolution observations with the primary goal of resolving these structures into individual GMCs and obtaining the first statistical sample of GMCs that condensed out of a cooling flow. While our previous ALMA observations have been very informative regarding the properties of compact molecular structures in cooling flows, the majority of the molecular gas (~70%), as measured by an IRAM 30m obervation, remains unaccounted for in the ALMA 12m array data. We therefore propose for a 7m array observation in CO(2-1) to probe the more extended and diffuse component of molecular gas. The distribution and kinematics of this dominant molecular component is essential for a full understanding of the formation of molecular gas in cooling flows.',\n"," 'Mapping the ISM in absorption-selected galaxies at high resolution. A key priority of absorption-line research has been to identify and study the galaxies presumed to host the gas dissected in absorption. Despite decades of sustained effort, only a very small fraction of damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs; defined by HI column densities representative of galactic discs) have been connected to visible galaxies. And, until recently, none have had observations of their molecular gas recorded in emission. In previous Cycles, we have made the first detections of the CO emission from six DLAs at redshifts z=0.1 to 0.8. These data imply remarkably large molecular gas masses (MH2~4x10^9 to 8x10^10) and high molecular gas fraction (f=0.3 to 0.9). The spatial resolution of these data is however very low (20kpc). Here, we request time to map the CO (4-3) emission from 3 of our most gas-rich DLA galaxies at ~kpc resolution to properly dissect the galaxies gas dynamics and study whether the bulk of the gas is in ordered disks or in extended haloes. Furthermore, the comparison between the flux in different CO transitions will allow us test whether the ISM conditions are comparable to that of MW-type galaxies, or whether the CO lines are closer to being thermalised.',\n"," 'A Comprehensive [CII] Survey of Herschel-Selected Starbursts at z=3-6. Based on a survey of the most luminous massive starburst galaxies found in >1000deg2 observed with Herschel, we have obtained a comprehensive sample of nearly 100 sources with secure, CO/CI-based spectroscopic redshifts. Here we propose to detect [CII] 158um emission from the star-forming ISM at z=3-6 in all 33 galaxies in our sample that are observable with the ACA, i.e., twice as many as in the largest massive starburst samples currently available. In combination with the rich suite of diagnostics already available, this study will provide critical insight into the physical properties of the ISM that set the conditions for star formation for a statistically significant sample, including a study of feedback based on the line profiles. Based on 9 systems in our sample for which we have already obtained <=1kpc resolution [CII] imaging with the ALMA 12m array, the ACA data will also provide a critical test for the potential presence of low surface brightness emission on >5-10kpc scales due to an enriched cold circum-galactic medium missed by high-resolution studies, as has been suggested to be present in star-forming galaxies in the early universe by some recent theoretical work.',\n"," 'Validating the L850-MH2 calibration with Herschel-ATLAS galaxies up to z~0.4 (resubmission). Disentangling the physical processes contributing to the decline in the cosmic star formation rate requires the measurement of the interstellar gas content of galaxies out to high redshift, but CO line observations are difficult and time-consuming. The development of a calibration between the dust continuum luminosity at 350 GHz (lambda = 850um) and the molecular gas content provides a more efficient method to infer the gas mass of high redshift galaxies, yet current measurements of the Lv850/MH2 ratio rely on small galaxy samples. How this ratio varies with other galaxy properties remains unknown. We thus propose to use 3.9 hrs of ALMA Band-6 and Band-7 to observe the dust continuum at 350 GHz to an rms of 0.2 mJy/beam, simultaneously tracing the CO(J=3-2) line at 346 GHz, for 34 galaxies selected from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS). With this large sample, we will (i) confirm the Lv850/MH2 ratio found in previous studies, (ii) identify any physical properties affecting the shape or scatter in the calibration, and (iii) provide to the community a robust calibration to apply to higher redshift observations.

Detecting galaxies from the local to the highest redshift Universe, including the epoch of cosmic reionization at z >6, and characterizing their star formation activities and physical properties are obviously a key issue to understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies as well as disentangling the relationship between the diverse populations of galaxies. While star formation and dynamics of low-z galaxies have been well studied using the CO lines as a tracer, those of high-z galaxies have not due to their faintness.Meanwhile, the ionized carbon 158 micron [CII]line can be a powerful alternative to detect high-z galaxies, because it is the strongest cooling line of interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies and observable at submm/mm when redshifted to z >6. The ALMA can detect high-z [CII]line only in a few hours and resolve galaxies in this line emission on a few kpc scales, enabling to probe obscured star formation and constrain sizes, dynamical masses and physical properties of ISM in early star-forming galaxies at the epoch of reionization for the first time.Here, we propose the ALMA [CII]line observation of star-forming galaxies at z >6. We particularly propose to target three galaxies at z=6.96, 7.109 and 7.215 discovered to date, because they are spectroscopically confirmed highest-class redshift objects in the epoch of reionization and we have a lot of information about these galaxies that can be compared with the ALMA observations. Using them as probes, we will (1) reveal the relation between high-z and local star-forming galaxies, (2) estimate obscured SFRs and state of reionization at z~7-7.2, (3) investigate the morphology, dynamics and physical properties of z~7-7.2 galaxies, and (4) to constrain the physical states of ISM in z~7-7.2 galaxies.',\n"," 'CO excitation and star-formation in gas-selected galaxies from z=0.5 to z=2.6. Damped Lyman alpha galaxies trace the dominant reservoirs of neutral hydrogen gas throughout cosmic history. Studies from UV, optical and near-IR emission have revealed rather low levels of star-formation activity at the respective redshifts. Surprisingly, targeting DLA systems with ALMA, we have found that a high fraction of the DLA-selected galaxies also have significant amounts of molecular gas similar to their stellar masses. Current understanding of the role of these absorption selected galaxies in the context of galaxy evolution is severely limited, and we need to determine the physical nature of the molecular gas, and its connection to the star-formation activity in these systems. In order to constrain the state of the molecular gas we here propose to target 6 DLA galaxies with high CO luminosities. With the proposed observatons, we will measure CO in a range of spectral-line transitions from CO(J=2-1) through to CO(J=7-6), with which we will determine the excitation state, density and temperature of the gas. Individual CO lines and their ratios are needed to measure hidden star-formation, and star-formation surface densities.',\n"," 'G0.253+0.016: A dense Galactic Center Cloud with low Star Formation Potential. We wish to study the temperature structure and the reservoir of dense gas in the Galactic Center molecular cloud G0.253+0.016. This is a cloud with unique physical properties: single-dish dust emission data indicates an enormous density (2x10^5 M_sun within 3 pc radius), but the cloud is essentially devoid of signposts for star formation (i.e., IR sources, Hii regions, masers). SMA and CARMA data (submitted to ApJ) reveal that very few cores of very dense gas exist in the cloud. The requested ALMA data form part of a long-term systematic study of the Central Molecular Zone. The main aim of the current proposal is to probe the clouds temperature structure. Line ratios indicate gas temperatures ~80K, but dust emission suggests values <30K. This difference is surprising, since the coupling of dust and gas temperatures should be efficient at the high observed densities. The high gas temperature may suppress fragmentation and therefore star formation. Given cooling times of a few 10^4 yr, the dust-gas temperature difference may hint at heating in a cloud-cloud collision. A secondary goal is to detect dense cores in dust emission. Despite relatively high sensitivity, the SMA was so far unable to detect such cores. The requested ALMA data will be more sensitive by a factor 20, and will thus help to constrain the density structure very well.',\n"," 'Disk Masses and Dust Grain Growth in Class I Protostars in Ophiuchus. Recent studies suggest that protoplanetary disks around 1-5 Myr old pre-main sequence stars contain insufficient mass to form giant planets. This may be because by this stage much of the material in the disk has already grown into larger bodies, hiding the material from sight. To test this hypothesis, we propose to observe a diverse sample of protostars in Ophiuchus younger than 1 Myr, whose disks are more likely to represent the initial mass budget of protoplanetary disks for forming planets. We will measure the mass of the disks around these protostars, constrain the maximum dust grain sizes in the disks, determine the geometry of the circumstellar material of these systems, and trace Keplerian rotation in the disks to measure the masses of the central protostars. By comparing the disk mass distribution and maximum dust grain sizes we derive for our sample with the existing 1-5 Myr old disk sample we will constrain the initial mass budget for forming planets in protoplanetary disks. We submitted a complementary proposal to repeat the experiment in Taurus but kept the proposals separate as they explore different star forming regions and are each self contained.',\n"," 'Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE). We have initiated the largest ever survey of red giant SiO masers in the Galactic bulge and inner Galaxy. At the 43 GHz and 86 GHz frequencies of the SiO maser we are not hindered by extinction, and accurate stellar velocities (<1 km/s) and positions are obtained with minimal observing time. The detection of up to ~35,000 red giant SiO maser sources will yield numbers comparable to optical surveys, but with the additional strength of a much more thorough coverage of the highly obscured inner Galaxy. The number of sources will be large enough to trace complex structures and minority populations. The velocity structure of these tracers is to be compared with the kinematic structures seen in gas, complex orbit structure in the bar, or stellar streams resulting from infallen systems. Modeling of the bar and bulge dynamics will be done using the new kinematic information in the inner Galaxy region. Our survey will also yield luminous SiO masers suitable for orbit and parallax determination using VLBI. We are successfully observing with our calibration scheme using the VLA at 43 GHz; we here propose to demonstrate its feasibility with ALMA in the southern sky at 86 GHz.',\n"," 'The role of the environment in shaping the CMF in the L1641 Molecular Clouds. We propose to use the C40-1 12-m array configuration in band 3 to observe 12 pre-stellar cores across the L1641 molecular clouds to derive their physical properties with regards to their local environment. Specifically we want to determine whether their formation and subsequent evolution on a filament or in the field affects the ongoing star formation process therein in any way. We will use the HCO and H13CO+ J=1-0 emission line to detect the infall motions within the cores as well as those from the local environment onto the cores and study any variations in the infall rate. We will further use the SiO (J=2-1) emission line to look for outflows towards these cores, indicative of very young proto-stellar sources and to fully characterise along with the infall motions the internal structure and dynamics the cores. We will further use the NH2D to trace the denset regions of the cores and derive their temperature and column density while the continuum emission will allow us to study the fragmentation level of the cores.',\n"," 'To launch or not: A study of magnetic fields in post-AGB objects with and without massive outflows. The study of magnetic fields in evolved stars is crucial for understanding the extreme departures from spherical symmetry that occur in the late stages of stellar evolution. Indeed the fields ability to launch and collimate the bipolar jets believed to be involved in the shaping of the envelopes of post-AGB (pAGB) objects is a matter of intense debate. But the observational study of magnetic fields so far is very limited. We therefore propose to use ALMA and its new full continuum polarization capability to study magnetic fields through observations of linear polarization of dust grain emission, in two well-studied pAGB objects. These are OH231.8+4.2 and the Red Rectangle, with the former showing a massive outflow and the latter a very weak one. The high-resolution ALMA data will allow us to detect and map the field at small scales and test the outflow-launching mechanism in each object.',\n"," 'Molecular budget of AGN discs and outflows. We propose to map with ACA 7m array the CO emission in a sample of local AGN host galaxies in order to obtain a reliable overview of the molecular gas distribution and kinematics on kpc-scales. The sample is drawn from a parent sample of 60 hard X-ray selected local AGN from the INTEGRAL IBIS AGN catalog. The 8 selected targets have ALMA 12m array data probing low J CO in the central few kpc, and MUSE/SINFONI@VLT data probing the ionised and warm molecular phase in their discs and NLR. With this proposal we aim at investigating specifically the cold molecular gas distribution over the kpc-scales that were filtered-out by the 12m array. We aim at a) deriving the total mass in the discs and outflows, and assess the cold gas kinematics out to 10-15 kpc scales, a region comparable to the MUSE field of view; and (b) deriving the spatial distribution of the gas fraction, joining ACA and ALMA 12m CO data and the stellar mass distribution derived from optical and NIR imaging. This we will allow us to obtain a comprehensive overview of the cold gas phase, its distribution and kinematics, to probe the AGN-galaxy interaction and scaling relations over different physical scales.',\n"," 'Unravelling the dust formation process in oxygen-rich AGB stars. As of today, the mechanism triggering the onset of the stellar wind and mass-loss rate in O-rich AGB stars is not yet understood: (1) We still do not know which are the first little dust seeds formed. (2) Launching a wind seems only possible when the grains are already quite large close to the star. (3) It has been hypothesized that the primary dust species in low and high mass-loss rate AGB stars are different. With ALMA, it is possible for the first time to get decisive information on the chemical processes, dynamics, and geometrical structure in the dust forming region of O-rich AGB stars. With ALMA band 7 in extended configuration, we can spatially resolve the dust forming region in 2 cornerstone O-rich AGB stars, being the best representatives for low and high mass-loss rate AGB stars: R Dor and IK Tau. By observing key molecular species contributing to the formation of dust grains (MgO, MgOH, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2, SiO, H2O, CaOH, NaCl, FeO, and MgS), we will be able to answer key questions on the efficiency of gas depletion by condensing onto dust grains, the dynamical structure in the dust forming region and the spatial correlation between the gas and dust species.',\n"," 'Forming giant planets: the initial conditions. We propose a comprehensive program to determine the structure of the outer region (> 20 AU) of protoplanetary disks around young A-type stars.

This information is fundamental to understand the initial conditions of gas giant planet formation and make the link with directly imaged exoplanets around A-type stars. Despite its importance, we still do not know the total amount of the gas reservoir available to form planets in disks. Thanks to ALMA we can now use the faint, optically thin, emission of the rare CO isotopologues to address the gas reservoir and its radial distribution. We have selected a sample of nearby, isolated disks for which we have collected a large multi-wavelength data set that will complement the ALMA images.

Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are Natures best particle acceleration laboratories. Young pulsars and young PWNe are very dynamic and can show evolutionary effects on timescales of a few years. Most young PWNe have been discovered and studied in X-rays, where the fluxes and spectral parameters of distinct jet and torus structures constrain the properties of the highly-relativistic pulsar wind particles, the acceleration mechanisms, and the geometry of the pulsar. Mm observations of PWNe can provide additional constraints, e.g., on the energy spectrum of the injected pulsar wind particles. The PWN in the supernova remnant Kes 75 was recently confirmed to be the youngest PWN in the Galaxy (380-520 years, Reynolds et al 2018). This PWN provides an unique opportunity to study the early evolution of a PWN and its powering pulsar. The PWN shows distinct small-scale (<10 arcsec) features in X-rays, e.g., jets. Different PWN regions have different X-ray spectral properties. We propose ALMA observations at a similar spatial resolution as the existing X-ray data in order to study the small-scale PWN morphology in the mm, and to constrain and compare their spectral properties in X-rays and mm.',\n"," 'Measuring an Emprical Temperature Structure for the HD 163296 Disk. Gas surface density and temperature profiles are among the most fundamental properties of a protoplanetary disk. These profiles regulate almost all observable characteristics of the disk, and therefore their accurate characterization has long been a goal of both disk observations and theory. In particular, poorly constrained parametric temperature structures are currently proving to be insufficient for interpretation of ALMA data, limiting progress on constraining disk properties such as turbulence. Observations of optically thick lines can break the degeneracies of parametric temperature structures, directly yielding the radial temperature profile of their emission surface layer. Furthermore, in an inclined disk these observations can be used to probe in the vertical direction, with a directly observable opening angle for each emission surface. We propose to exploit these properties and constrain the 2-D (radial and vertical) temperature structure of the HD 163296 disk by observing multiple transitions of optically thick CO isotopologues. Our results will provide the first fully empirical temperature structure for a protoplanetary disk.',\n"," 'Zooming in on the parsec-scale structure of CO gas at low metallicity and its relation to star formation. The star formation rate is proportional to the surface density of molecular gas, for a wide range of metallicities. Models predict that the structure of CO-emitting gas should change with metallicity and radiation field: extended CO emission and CO \"clumps\" should shrink as metallicity decreases or radiation field strength increases. This effect has never been directly observed before, and models of CO formation have not been put to a test. Additionally, the effects of those changes on the star formation process, which occurs in dense, CO-emitting gas, are unknown. We propose to obtain deep maps of two transitions (1-0 and 2-1) of three CO isotopes (12CO, 13CO, and C18O) in 6 regions of two low-metallicity galaxies, the LMC and the SMC. These observations will allow us to test CO photo-chemical models by providing deep maps of the pc-scale structure, column density, thermal, and chemical state of the CO-emitting gas at two low metallicities and a range of radiation fields. By comparing the CO maps to pc-resolution tracers of star formation, specifically 24 micron emission and young stellar objects, we will bridge the gap between Galactic and extragalactic star formation studies',\n"," 'Diffuse cold atomic gas in Seyfert galaxies: to reveal multi-phase nature of AGN obscuration. Recent high resolution observations of both dense molecular and diffuse atomic gas in the Circinus galaxy showed consistent physical/dynamical properties to what expected in the multi-phase fountain torus model, which may explain the physical origin of AGN tori. As an international collaboration of AGN researchers (GATOS), we here propose high resolution (0.1\" ~ 10 pc) [CI](1-0) observations toward 2 nearby Seyfert galaxies to test the fountain model in a wider parameter space. Importantly, we already have the same resolution CO(3-2) data of these objects, allowing us to study the multi-phase nature of the tori straightforwardly. With this short time program, we will investigate the density structure of the tori, as well as the existence of atomic outflows (a key process to maintain the fountain torus structure): our dedicated simulations will be useful for these purposes. We can also study the intriguing dependence of the toruss geometrical structure on an Eddington ratio, which was suggested by recent hard X-ray surveys.',\n"," 'ACA Monitoring of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) targets during the April 2020 EHT Campaign. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration (EHTC) is requesting observations of several sources in Cycle 7, with the aim of resolving black hole shadows and jet launching regions in AGN. These are expected to be observed over a 2-week window in April 2020, using several ~5-15 hr observing runs, triggered based on weather and telescope readiness, i.e. individual sources will be observed over several days with unpredictable gaps in daily coverage. Here we propose daily ACA monitoring of four key EHTC-proposed sources: SgrA*, M87, 3C279, and OJ287 - during the EHT campaign. The primary goals of this proposal are to obtain: (a) better than 10% absolute flux calibration (per daily epoch) for all sources in the EHT observing runs (via bootstrapping); (b) constrain the origin of variability (e.g., proper motions vs relative brightening of individual components, or hot-spot orbits in Sgr A*) seen in EHT images on individual days; (c) a better comparison with the multi-wavelength (cm to X-ray) campaign. Overall, these observations will lead to a significantly better, and perhaps crucial, understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to variability on event horizon scales.',\n"," 'Cometary out-gassing or icy planetesimal collision in a young debris disk?. There is a pivotal point in the lifetime of circumstellar disks at the 5-10 Myr mark: the transition between gas-rich proto-planetary disks towards gas-poor debris disks. It is thought that planets must be formed before (giant planets) or shortly after (rocky planets) this critical phase, and yet the details of how this transition proceeds is poorly constrained. A key observable to better understand this short-lived phase is the detection and characterization of gas in young debris disks, as we can learn about the formation and evolution of icy planetesimals and cometary bodies. We detected the CO 6-5 emission line in the 10 Myr old debris disk around HR4796, using APEX. This unique high transition detection for a debris disk is even more interesting as the line appears blue-shifted without a red counter-part, suggesting an asymmetric distribution of the gas. We propose ALMA Band 9 observations (C40-3), as the unmatched spatial resolution will enable us to constrain the kinematics of the gas. With these new observations, we could reveal on-going cometary out-gassing in the inner regions of the disk, or collisions of icy planetesimals in the debris disk at about 1\".',\n"," 'Characterizing the Atmosphere and Surface of Triton with ALMA. Triton possesses one of two known micro-bar class atmospheres in our Solar System, with the other belonging to Pluto. Both atmospheres are dominated by N2 in vapor equilibrium with surface ices, with trace amounts of CH4 and CO. Our Cycle 2 ALMA observations of Plutos atmosphere were quite successful: we detected strong CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3), allowing characterization of the atmosphere in ways that the New Horizons mission could not (neither species was observable by NH). We now propose to obtain comparitive data for Triton, by conducting a sensitive search for CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) in its atmosphere. From our observations we will i) determine the column abundance of CO to 20%, a factor of 15 better than determined in the near-IR, providing insight into the nature of atmosphere-surface interaction and the maintenance of the atmosphere over time ii) search for HCN, which if detected provides a crucial constraint for understanding Tritons atmospheric photochemistry and microphysics, thermal balance, and volatile escape rates. ALMA is the only facility that can perform the observations necessary to characterize the atmosphere of Triton.',\n"," 'Hidden in plain sight: dynamical mass estimates for a newly-discovered red monster at zspec~5.6 in the GOODS-S field. A surprising result of early JWST observations was the discovery of several extremely massive galaxies up to z~8 challenging the standard LCDM model. However, the lack of spectroscopic redshifts and inherent uncertainties of SED fitting sparked a debate about a possible overestimation of stellar masses. The only way to resolve this tension is dynamical masses. Here, we propose to do exactly this for an even more extreme galaxy at zspec=5.58 discovered in deep JWST images and spectra. It is extremely red and massive - almost Milky Way mass already at 1Gyr after the Big Bang - and has a very extended dust distribution (ALMA 1.1mm size ~6 kpc). This monster was hiding in plain sight in the GOODS-S field. Despite 30 years of observations, it was only now revealed thanks to ALMA and JWST. We propose partially resolved [CII]158um emission line observations: the most efficient approach to obtain its dynamical mass, total star formation rate, and gas distribution. This is the only way to test its overly massive nature within LCDM, study the formation of such extended dust (and/or gas) distributions, and understand the formation of extreme sources in the first 1Gyr of the Universe.',\n"," 'Molecular gas content of massive star-forming galaxies in a galaxy cluster at z=1.46. We propose Band-3 observations targeting CO(2-1) emissions from [OII]-selected massive star-forming galaxies in a z=1.46 galaxy cluster to investigate molecular gas content of the galaxies. The location where our targets inhabit implies that they are probably progenitors of the present-day massive galaxies in galaxy clusters. Interestingly, the galaxies are growing with star formation activity and still in intense evolutionary phase. Thus, the galaxies are one of the best targets to discuss how the cluster galaxies evolved and acquired the characteristic properties such as less star-formation activity and bulge-dominated morphology. We focus on gas reservoir, depletion timescale of molecular gas and efficiency of star formation. We compare the gas properties in the cluster galaxies with those in the field galaxies, and identify what is a key process governing the evolution of cluster galaxies. Note that even if CO emission lines are not detected from our targets, the proposed observations are deep enough for us to conclude that the cluster galaxies at z=1.46 contain less amount of molecular gas at a given stellar mass compared to field galaxies at similar redshifts.',\n"," 'Directly measuring the progression of infall from the envelope to the disk-forming region of BHR 71. Infall transforms dense cores into protostars. During the embedded phase of star formation, the evolution of infall determines the final mass of the central protostar as well as the initial condition of the disk and planet formation. Theoretical studies still debate about the types of infall, the \"inside-out\" or \"outside-in\" fashions, and the effects of rotation and magnetic fields; only few direct observation of infall exists to constrain the infall process. Previously, we have detected an unambiguous signature of infall, toward an embedded protostar, BHR 71, and modeled the infall kinematics. To trace the progression of infall, we propose here to measure the radial variation of infall toward BHR 71 via multiple transitions of HCO+, empirically probing the infall at different radii, and the resolved emission of complex organic molecules (COMs), tracing the kinematics close to the disk. We will trace the kinematics from the envelope (~1000 au) to the disk-forming region (~30 au), identifying the type of infall and probing the transition from infall to rotation. Furthermore, we will survey the high frequency emission of COMs to complement the previous discovery of COMs.',\n"," 'Resolving dust continuum in intrinsically-faint H-dropout ALMA galaxies behind lensing clusters. We propose to obtain ~0.2 arcsec resolution 1.2 mm dust-continuum images of five lensed (intrinsically faint) NIR-dark ALMA galaxies at z = 2 5. Recent ALMA deep observations uncover faint (sub)mm-selected galaxies and a fraction of them are known to be invisible even in the deepest HST/WFC3 (and even JWST/NIRCam) near-infrared images (i.e., H-band dropouts), but their nature remains elusive partly because their faintness hampers any further spectroscopic and high-resolution follow-up observations. The proposed sources are apparently bright thanks to significant magnification (mu = 5 9) and therefore provide ideal laboratory to investigate physical properties of intrinsically-faint dust-obscured galaxies. We will directly measure the sizes of dust emission to test the proposed scenarios on the origin(s) of near-infrared darkness, i.e., the compactness of dust and stellar distributions or disk inclination (i.e., galaxies seen in edge-on). Preliminary dust source size measurements of reconstructed source plane images using ~1 arcsec images already suggest a diversity of physical cause. Confirming it by ~0.2 arcsec resolution observations of more sources will be a logical step.',\n"," 'Revealing the Physical Properties of Molecular Gas Associated with the Magellanic SNR N132D. In supernova remnants (SNRs), the interaction between the shock waves and the ambient interstellar gas is an essential process which affects evolution, high-energy emission, and relativistic particle acceleration. Therefore, it is important to study the detailed physical properties of the interaction between SNRs and interstellar gas, in order to understand the underlying processes. N132D is the brightest SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and is thought to be associated with the molecular clouds. Most recently, we found the interacting molecular gas by using the Mopra 12CO(J=1-0) dataset. However, we could not reveal the detailed structures and the physical conditions. We propose to observe N132D and its surroundings with 12CO(J=1-0) line emission by ALMA and to determine the physical properties of molecular clouds interacting with the shock waves. ALMAs sensitivity and spatial resolution will allow us to study in detail the CO gas interacting with the \"extragalactic SNR\" for the first time.',\n"," 'Probing the magnetic field towards a massive dense core in the potential well of a hub-filament system. There is a growing evidence of the role of hub-filament systems in the formation of high-mass stars. These systems are believed to provide the fast accretion rates and the internal turbulent support needed for the massive dense prestellar cores to accrete a large fraction of their mass before the feedback from the central protostars disperse the surrounding material. However, the formation and evolution of these systems at the early prestellar phase are still unexplored. Especially the strength of the magnetic field in dense cores (densities >10^7cm-3) is not constrained observationally. We propose ALMA (cycle 7) 3mm full polarization observations to measure the Zeeman splitting of the hyperfine transitions of the CN(1-0) to derive the magnetic field intensity of one of the most extreme massive dense prestellar core sitting in the centre of a hub threaded by multiple filaments. With these observations we seek to measure the Zeeman effect to derive the magnetic field strength and study the role of the magnetic field and its interplay with turbulence and gravity in the formation and evolution of such massive, cold, and dense prestellar cores, the progenitors of high-mass stars.',\n"," 'Imaging a unique massive binary BH candidate in OJ287 with the EHT+ALMA. We propose 1 mm EHT+ALMA observations of the BL Lac object OJ287, one of the best candidates for hosting a binary SMBH and to study jet formation in magnetically dominated AGN. The improvement in the north-south resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA and the comparison with quasi-simultaneous, resolution-matched 3 mm GMVA+ALMA and 1.3 cm space-VLBI RadioAstron images will allow us to perform Faraday rotation synthesis and opacity analysis approaching linear scales of 26 Rs. Comparison with a similar campaign performed in spring 2017 will allow us, for the first time, to study the time evolution of the innermost jet structure, magnetic field strength and 3D structure, accretion flow, and non-thermal particle population at scales not probed before in an AGN jet. This information will be used to test jet formation models and the uniqueness of the binary SMBH interpretation by comparing to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion disks that might provide a competing model to OJ287. The proposed EHT+ALMA observations promise for the first time to directly reveal the nature of such elusive binary systems.',\n"," 'High resolution ALMA imaging of gas and dust in low-z gas rich galaxies (resubmission). One of the most striking differences between the nearby and high-z star-formation activity is the presence of giant molecular clumps in gas-rich disk-galaxies which can be as 100-1000x more massive than those seen locally. Is it therefore crucial to understand the dynamical processes that give birth to those high-z gas-rich and highly turbulent disks. From our previous experiments, we have identified three gas-rich galaxies, f_gas=MH2/(MH2+Mstar)>0.3 at z~0.1-0.2, which could be perfect laboratories to understand the star-forming physics seen in gas rich galaxies at z>1. As a follow-up campaign, we propose to target these three bright, gas-rich galaxies to resolve at 0.2\" resolution (sub-kpc-scale rest-frame) the detailed spatial distribution of the 850 micron dust continuum and 12CO(3-2) line, in order to examine the dynamics of these recently discovered galaxies at z~0.1-0.2. At the exquisite signal-to-noise provided by their nearby nature, we can put tight constraints on the internal properties of these galaxies, including Larsons relations, the Kennicutt-Schimdt law and the L850-MH2 calibration for the different molecular gas regions.

We propose to follow-up our Cycle 1 (delivered in Cycle 2) observations to fully trace the 3D velocity field of the material accreting onto a newly forming O-star. Our target, W33A, a proto-O-star, is nearby (2.4 kpc) and well studied, already having a rare combination of high resolution observations at near-IR (Gemini-AO- 0.13\") and mid-IR (VLTI-MIDI - 0.04\") plus our Cycle 1 data (~0.3\"). Our ALMA data show a spiral filament feeding material to the central region, where the velocity profile show signs of rotation, suggesting the O-star is forming via a disk. This `disk appears disrupted by infalling streams (we find at one on 1000au scales - Maud et al. 2017 MNRAS 472 120), fragmentation due to gravitational instability, or interaction with companions. However, we have not yet resolved the disk scales <500au of the system to determine which is the case. Our 3D radiative transfer models (dust & gas) including infall from the outer rotating envelope onto a compact system best matches the binary scenario (disk radii <250au). ALMA will reveal the answer, as it is the only instrument that can zoom in and image the sub-100au scales, allowing us to test massive star formation theories.',\n"," 'Imaging Gravitational Instability in the most massive FU Ori object. One of the surprising findings of ALMAs HL Tau observations is the lack of spiral arms and/or clumps, which are the ubiquitous features of gravitational instability (GI). Considering HL Tau is one of the most massive disks, it cast doubts on whether GI ever operates in protoplanetary disks. We propose to look for the signatures of GI in disks which are even more massive than HL Tau. FU Orionis/Exor objects are great candidates to search for GI as most theoretical models imply thay their disks should be unstable. Our ALMA Cycle-2 program has targeted several FU Orionis/EXor objects and we choose the most massive disk, V883 Ori (~0.6 Msun), to obtain high angular resolution data to search for the spiral arms and/or clumps caused by GI. Imaging GI would be a ground-breaking discovery. However, if we not find any signatures of GI in this extremely massive disk, it will put stringent constraints on all current disk outburst models. Whatever the case, our program will be a major contribution to the understanding of the FU Ori phenomenon. At 450 pc, V883 Ori is so bright (360 mJy in band-6) that it can be imaged at 0.034\" (15 AU) resolution in only 1.2 hs.',\n"," 'Further observations of R Aqr. This is a continuation of a successfull project, 2017.1.00363.S, devoted to study the line and continuum emission in the symbiotic stellar system (SS) R Aqr. R Aqr is a prototypical SS, a binary with an AGB star and a white dwarf that show a strong interaction. Our cycle 5 observations show for the first time the flow of material between both stars and the gravitational effects of the secondary on the wind from the AGB: the mass loss is strongly focused in the orbital plane and a double spiral appears. The data are strikingly in agreement with predictions from our preliminary hydrodynamical models. We also detected the birth of the bipolar jets (at scales of some AU!), which extend several arcmin at other wavelengths. However, the attained resolution, 30x40 mas, is hardly enough to detect the crucial phenomena, since the stars are separated by 30-40 mas. Particularly, the flow between both stars requires confirmation from maps with the highest resolution. In addition, a good analysis of the data, both in lines and continuum, requires observations at several wavelengths. We propose to observe also in bands 7 and 9, including data of the continuum and the CO J=2-1 and 6-5 lines.',\n"," 'The cold ISM in nearby analogs of cosmic reionization sources. We propose to measure the molecular gas content in a sample of z~0.3 Lyman continuum emitting galaxies we have recently discovered with the HST. These galaxies are compact, highly star-forming galaxies with strong optical emission lines, which resemble «green peas» and luminous compact galaxies. These rare at low-z galaxies are currently the best nearby analogs of the sources of cosmic reionization. The proposed CO(3-2) observations will inform us for the first time about the molecular gas properties of these unique and extremely interesting sources. We will determine the total molecular gas mass and column density, gas fraction, molecular gas depletion time scales, and aim at constraining kinematics of the cold gas. This will allow us to address key questions on their ISM properties, the gas consumption times, and the feedback processes allowing the escape of ionizing radiation. The properties of the Lyman continuum emitting galaxies will also be compared to those of normal and dwarf galaxies at z~0-3. Our observations will provide important insights for the ISM in these galaxies, and pave the way for understanding how similar galaxies can reionize the Universe at early epochs.',\n"," 'A search for the missing cold dark matter subhalos. We propose to observe three strongly lensed dusty, star forming galaxies (DSFGs) in band 7 to detect low-mass dark matter subhalos by measuring the minute distortions they cause in the lensed images of the background sources. The abundance of low-mass subhalos is a key discriminating prediction of the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, and strong lensing is a unique tool that can test this prediction. We have already made the first detection of a subhalo in ALMA observations of a strong lensing system (SDP.81) and have shown that this dataset is very sensitive to the presence of subhalos down to ~ 2X10^7 M_sun. This uniquely positions ALMA to measure the mass function of dark matter subhalos with unprecedented precision and thereby resolve one of the most important puzzles in modern cosmology.',\n"," 'Molecular abundances in the low-metallicity environment of the Far-Outer Galaxy. The metallicity Z of gas in galaxies increases steadily with time, as stars evolve and progressively release heavy elements into the interstellar medium. Low metallicities characterise the outer regions of our own Galaxy, which can in turn modify the abundances of molecules in the clouds formed here. Very few studies have, however, been dedicated to the investigation of the molecular content of clouds in the outer Galaxy, especially for molecules other than CO. The significant difference in metallicity between the inner and outer Galaxy makes a comparative study of abundances in these two regions of the galactic disk the most promising way of assessing the influence of Z on the chemistry, and will allow to test the predictions of the models for these conditions. Because low metallicities are also typical of dwarf irregulars and higher-redshift galaxies, this will be a first step towards a characterisation of the chemistry in molecular clouds in external galaxies and in the early Universe.',\n"," 'A galaxy on fire: witnessing the initial phase of starburst in the core of a distant cluster?. Being unparalleled in terms of imaging quality and depth compared to competing projects, the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey is the only existing large-scale extragalactic survey capable of delivering large galaxy cluster samples out to z=1.4. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign of the HSC cluster sample at z>1, we have fortuitously discovered a blue ring encircling a red galaxy, located at the center of a low mass cluster. Using archival and our own optical spectroscopic data, we have established that both the ring, its central galaxy, and two neighboring galaxies are all at the same redshift, z=1.06. Furthermore, the galaxy trio is strongly detected in archival Spitzer and Herschel data, indicating a star formation rate of 200 Msun/yr. It appears that the cluster center is experiencing an intense episode of star formation. We propose to conduct CO(2-1) transition observation of the cluster, to (1) measure the gas kinematics of the ring system, and (2) measure the total molecular gas content in the cluster center. The data will allow us to uncover the origin of the star forming ring, and the star formation activity in the core of this cluster.',\n"," 'The role of cosmic rays regulating star formation in AGN. The giant radio-galaxy 3C326N is perhaps one of the best examples of negative AGN feedback. With 2e9 Msun of molecular gas, its SFR is only <0.07 Msun/yr, 20 times lower than what is expected from the Kennicutt law. Why is star formation suppressed? Outflows and turbulence are possible culprits, but the role of cosmic rays (CR) has been neglected, because we lack constraints on the CR flux. However, they could play a major role by heating the molecular gas, controlling its ionization state, and driving outflows, which could regulate star formation. To test those hypothesis, we propose to map with ALMA the CO(1-0) and [CI]609um lines in 3C326N. Our models show that the CO/[CI] line ratio is a sensitive diagnostic of the CR ionization rate. We will search for a CR-driven outflow by looking at spatial variations of the CO/[CI] ratio. If CRs turn out to be an important source of ionization and heating of the H2 gas, they could provide a universal, and so far ignored, mechanism for AGN feedback. The AGN physics explored here will greatly enhance our understanding of why 3C326N, and massive early-type galaxies in general, have large masses of molecular gas but yet weak star formation.',\n"," 'Detecting the Full Range of z~4 Galaxies Associated with Damped Ly-alpha Systems. As a continuation of our extremely successful cycle 3, 4 and 5 programs to detect the z~4 galaxies associated with high metallicity damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in [CII] emission, we propose to observe ALL known DLAs between z~4.1 and z~4.5 with an accurate metallcity determination. This will constitute the first such sample at any redshift whereby we will cover a full sample of metallicity unbiased DLAs in order to search for the associated galaxy. This will allow us to: 1) determine the star formation rate (SFR), dust content, and size of the full range of DLAs at a given redshift slice. 2) establish the extent of the HI absorption around z~4 star-forming galaxies. The current sample of galaxies associated with high-metallicity DLAs suggest that they are massive dusty, star-forming galaxies with large extended halos of HI gas. The proposed observations will determine if these statements are valid for the general DLA population as well.',\n"," 'The origin of Argonium (ArH+). ABSTRACT: Among the many hydrides detected in the interstellar medium, the molecular ion ArH+ is uniquely expected to reach observable abundances only in nearly pure atomic hydrogen regions with less than 0.1% H2. Previous observations of ArH+ emission associated with the supernova remnant Cas A and ArH+ absorption along Galactic sightlines toward distant star-forming regions have allowed the identification of ArH+ and the evaluation of its column densities. However, due to the complexity of the velocity structure and the presence of large amounts of H2-bearing gas, information on the intrinsic ArH+ line profile and the in situ abundance of ArH+ cannot be extracted from the data. We propose to observe the ground state ArH+ transition at 617.5 GHz toward the radio loud quasar and bright ALMA calibrator 3C454.3 where there are exceptionally complete observations including optical NaI, KI, CaII absorption along with HI, OH HCO+, CO and many other molecules, tracing the cold and warm gas phases. The proposed observation will allow us to identify in a unique way the conditions under which ArH+ exists in the ISM and which phases of the atomic gas are traced by ArH+.',\n"," 'Resolving the Radio Core of Eta Carinae. Eta Carinae is an LBV star forming part of a high mass binary system. The objective of this project is to map the region that emits at submillimeter wavelengths, in the continuum and in the H30 alpha recombination line, using band 6. The region was observed with ALMA in Cycle 0 but was not resolved, even at the highest frequency (630 GHz, resolution 0.45x0.32 arc sec). The integrated continuum spectrum (between 100 and 630 GHz) is characteristic of a compact HII region that becomes optically thin around 250 GHz and H and He recombination lines showed signatures of departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium. From these observations and assuming a spherical expanding shell with constant electron density and temperature, we were able to determine univocally the radius, shell width, density, temperature, and expansion velocity. The radius of the shell is about 0.2 arc sec, and its width a tenth of this value, which makes it possible to resolve with ALMA in its extended Cycle 4 configuration. Depending of the image of the ionized emitting matter, its origin can be attributed to an LBV ejection episode or to the concentration of shocked matter produced in the wind-wind collision.',\n"," 'A first determination of HC14N/HC15N on Neptune: filling a nitrogen isotopic ratio gap in the middle of our solar system. We propose to observe Neptunes HC15N(J=4-3) emission line along with HCN(J=4-3) and H13CN(J=4-3 simultaneously for the first determination of 14N/15N isotopic ratio in Neptunes atmosphere to constrain the formation and evolution scenario and/or the origin of the stratospheric volatiles. In our solar system, measured 14N/15N values can be grouped as Sun/Jupiter (~440) and comet (~150) group. Since Neptune is located in the middle of Jupiter and the outer solar system, a new measurement of its nitrogen isotopic ratio value will not only fill the gap in our knowledge on the radial variations of isotopic ratio slope but also to constrain the formation process scenario and/or the origin of the stratospheric volatiles.',\n"," 'From the main sequence to the red cloud: linking the molecular cloud lifecycle to galaxy evolution. The molecular cloud lifecycle, the efficiency of star formation and the coupling of feedback to the ISM depend both on local and global conditions, and strongly affect the global evolution of galaxies, from the main sequence to the red cloud. Mapping the molecular gas on the cloud scale across a broad range of environments is a key step to measure these quantities and understand how the local physical processes contribute to regulating star-formation and feedback in galaxies on large scales. We propose to apply the high sensitivity and high angular resolution of ALMA to map the molecular gas disc down to cloud scales in a sample of early-type galaxies, which are in (or have completed) the transition from the main sequence to the red cloud, and study the interplay between small-scale physics and galactic structure. Combined with our previous results on ~20 star-forming main sequence galaxies, we will thus cover the complete evolutionary track of galaxies. This will provide strong constraints on whether galaxy quenching is driven by a cloud-scale inefficiency of star formation or by galaxy-scale processes.',\n"," 'Investigating the evolution of the dwarf disk in XZ Tau B in real time. Using ALMA LBC SV data we imaged, on the edge of the field-of-view, a dwarf transitional disk around the young star XZ Tau B (Osorio et al. 2016). The disk has an outer radius of only 3.4 au and a central cavity of radius 1.3 au. Because of its small size, orbital periods are short and rapid changes are expected in the disk azimuthal structure that could be observable on timescales of just a few months. We requested Cycle 4 observing time to obtain a first-epoch high-quality image of the disk centered on the source. These Cycle 4 observations are scheduled in June 2017. Here we are requesting a second-epoch image in Cycle 5, to be observed in October-November 2017. The two images will be obtained with a difference of 4-5 months, allowing to observe changes in the azimuthal structure of the disk during this time interval. Extrapolation of these results, together with additional monitoring, will provide a robust basis for characterizing the slower evolution of larger disks.',\n"," 'Unveiling the nature of the reddest submillimeter sources in lensing cluster fields. We propose to unveil the nature of very red submm sources discovered in four out of 10 Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) clusters followed up at 870microns with LABOCA. Undetected in the Herschel bands, these sources may be the first submm selected galaxies with moderate intrinsic luminosities (LFIR<10^12 Lsol) at very high redshifts (z>5) or low luminosity cold dusty galaxies with Td<25K. Measuring their luminosities and redshifts will put important constraints on the density of normal dusty star forming galaxies beyond z=4 and on the fraction of dusty star formation occuring in cold galaxies at lower redshift. Mapping at 1.1mm with a sensitivity of 0.1mJy will allow us to detect these sources with S/N>10 as well as any other lensed galaxy with an intrinsic LFIR>10^11 Lsol up to z=10, and enable us to unambiguously identify their counterparts, estimate their redshift, and constrain their FIR luminosity and dust temperature.

We propose to obtain, using ALMA in both extended and compact configurations, high angular resolution and high imaging quality maps of the CO J=6-5 line emission (rest-frame 691.473 GHz) and the 450 micron continuum of two nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; having LIR>10^11 Lsun): NGC34 (Sy2, D=84 Mpc, 1=407 pc) and NGC1614 (starburst, D=68 Mpc, 1=331 pc). These observations will exploit the best angular resolution (0.23\") that ALMA can achieve in its shortest wavelength band (Band-9) available for the Early Science Call, and will resolve for the first time distributions of warm molecular gas (T>50K) and sub-millimeter dust radiation in LIRGs with spatial resolutions better than 100 pc. NGC34 and NGC1614 have recently been observed by Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) for the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) from J=4-3 to J=13-12. Among 125 LIRGs in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) that are being observed by Herschel, they are (1) the closest, (2) the brightest in CO(6-5) line flux, (3) with the best Band-9 transmission during the transit, and (4) showing strong nuclear activity. The high spatial and velocity resolutions of our proposed ALMA observations (5.02 hr in total) are crucial in distinguishing different nuclear gas configurations, e.g., outflow or inclined circum-nuclear disks. The ALMA data will allow us to address such important questions as: (i) Is the outflow strong enough to power the warm CO emission now and quench the star formation in future in both LIRGs (one starburst and one AGN)? (ii) Can the hard X-ray irradiation dominate the excitation of the warm CO around an AGN? And how large are the X-ray dominated regions (XDRs)?',\n"," 'High Velocity Masers in the Galactic Center: A New Probe of General Relativity. We propose to conduct a search for high-velocity circumstellar SiO masers close to the Galactic central black hole (Sgr A*). Position and velocity tracking of maser-emitting stars within 0.1 pc of Sgr A* will provide multiple direct probes of the metric (stellar motion plus light propagation) and will enable numerous tests of general relativity not possible with binary pulsars. If SiO maser-emitting stars are identified close to Sgr A*, then the exceptional spatial and spectral resolution of the complete ALMA can test the equivalence principle, the \"no-hair\" theorem of black holes, and frame-dragging. While previous surveys for low-velocity masers have been done, the proposed survey will be 10 times more sensitive and will have 100 times the bandwidth to detect high velocity stars deep in the gravitational potential of the central black hole. Our maser survey requires a single pointing and tuning and only 38 minutes of on-source integration (1.21 hours total). The proposed observations will resolve stellar positions down to 0.01 pc from the central black hole and identify high-velocity stars at distances as small as 0.001 pc.',\n"," 'The home stretch: Completing the redshift catalogue of a large flux-limited high-redshift Herschel sample. We propose to measure with the ACA redshifts of 23 galaxies from the brightest (S500um > 80 mJy) sub-millimeter (submm) galaxies from the Herschel surveys, that will complete our catalogue of robust redshifts for 270 high-redshift Herschel sources, as measured by on-going projects using NOEMA and ALMA and previous ACA programs. These remaining sources are observed most efficiently with the ACA. A complete coverage of this 500um flux-limited sample of 270 bright submm galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts is crucial to draw statistical conclusions, enabling us to determine the role of hyper-luminous (Lfir > 10^13 Lsun) galaxies in cosmic stellar mass assembly, increase the number of known lensed sources at the peak of cosmic evolution (z ~ 2.5), and identify other types of rare objects. Together with existing and ongoing ancillary data in the optical and near-infrared (SALT, NTT, VLT, Keck, Spitzer and HST), this comprehensive sample will provide the baseline for future detailed studies of the brightest galaxies at the peak of cosmic evolution, and will be unique until the next generation of (submm) space telescopes.',\n"," 'Spectral line survey in the rest-frame 350 GHz band toward a lensed sub-mm galaxy at z=2.3. Over the past decade, some unbiased spectral line surveys toward nearby galaxies have been conducted. The target galaxies cover a wide range in star formation activity, nucleus activity, and metallicity. Indeed, these surveys have revealed how chemical composition is sensitive to a specific geature of a galaxy. For instance, our recent line surveys toward the two dwarf galaxies, the LMC and IC10, have revealed characteristic chemical compositionin low-metallicity environments: less abundant nitrogen-bearing species, enhancement of CCH, and deficiency of CH3OH. Such chemical diagnostics of the local galaxies are now developing. However, high-redshift galaxies are still left unexplored from an astrochemical perspective. To overcome situation, we propose a spectral line survey in the rest-frame 350 GHz band toward a lensed sub-millimeter galaxy SMM J2135-0102 (the Cosmic Eyelash) at z=2.326. In our frequency settings, the lines of CCH, CH3OH, HCN, and HCO+ are included. These species are sensitive to UV radiation, cosic ray, and metallicity. We will obtain chemical template of high-redshift starburst galaxy and compare it with that of nearby galaxies and high-redshifr quasar.',\n"," 'High Resolution Imaging of the Diffuse and Dense Gas in the Early Stage Merging Galaxy NGC 5331. Under the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario, galaxy-galaxy interaction is believed to play an important role in galaxy evolution, changing the galaxy morphology and triggering star-burst and/or AGN. Recent high spatial resolution (tens of pc scale) numerical simulations have found that tidal interaction is responsible for both merger induced gas inflow (nuclear star-burst) and high dispersion gas of dense gas clump surrounded by diffuse gas cloud (widespread star-burst) in the early stage of the interaction. An observational test of the gas response requires mapping both the diffuse and dense gas tracers at high spatial resolution, especially at early stage interaction. Here we propose ALMA Band 3 observation of the CO, HCN, and HCO+ toward the brightest galaxy in our previous OVRO survey catalog of early stage mergers, NGC5331, at 0.4 arcsec (~ 280 pc) resolution. The primary aim of this study is to observationally confirm the gas inflow toward nuclear regions and the clumpy molecular gas structure with high dense gas fraction in the outer disks. In addition, we will investigate how the distribution of molecular gas evolves along merger stage by using ALMA archival CO image.',\n"," 'Captured in Action: the Evolution of Core Mass Function from Prestellar to UCHII Stages in a Linear Filament. The central question of star formation is how mass is converted from dense cores into stars, or, how the core mass function (CMF) evolves to reproduce the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Lack of robust observational constraints on high-mass star-forming CMF has led to diverse theoretical views. With our recent ALMA project as a proof of concept, we propose mosaic imaging of a massive (1500 Msun/pc) linear filament harbouring a sequence of three evolutionary stages in a roll (prestellar->protostellar->UCHII region). The proposed ALMA 1.3mm image will resolve the entire cloud down to 1000 AU with a mass sensitivity of 0.04Msun, allowing a full sampling of individual cores down to 0.2 Msun completeness. We will (1) construct the CMF of the cloud as a whole and the three stages individually, to study CMF evolution; (2) quantify the clustering Q-parameter and study its evolution; (3) quantify the virial state of the cores using N2D+ and other lines, to distinguish theoretical models; (4) search for flow motions with a linear resolution better than the studies of nearby filaments. The results will provide stringent constraints to inform theoretical works.',\n"," 'Most active on-going star formation in the Local Group: Resolving filaments and cloud cores in the LMC. High-mass star forming regions are relatively few in the solar neighborhood. Much more active and extensive high-mass star formation is found outside the Milky Way. Studies of such regions are important since they provide a link to distant active starbursst. Our target here is the giant molecular cloud (GMC) in N159, an HII region located in the nearest external galaxy Large Magellanic Cloud having lower metalicity than the Milky Way. N159 is the most intense and concentrated molecular cloud as shown by the brightest 12CO J=3-2 source in the LMC, and thus ideal to study the current most-massive cluster formation in the Local Group. Nearby HII region, 30Dor, is not forming massive clusters anymore and is not a suitable witness to cluster formation. Theories predict that cluster-forming regions consist of pre-stellar cores of sub-pc/pc scale and filaments connecting these cores. Such a picture finds increasing support from recent Herschel observation etc. In ALMA cycle1 operation we propose to observe the most active on-going star formation sites in J=2-1 and 1-0 transitions of 12CO and 13CO, J=2-1 transition of CS and dust continuum in band 3 and 6. These observations should provide a powerful tool to probe molecular cores and their connecting filaments for a large density range, 10^2cm^-3 to 10^4cm^-3, relevant to quantify their physical parameters at sub-pc scales. We request 4.92hrs ALMA cycle1 observing time in total in order to achieve this goal.',\n"," 'Probing Star Formation in Quasar Host Galaxies at z~2. Feedback from black hole (BH) growth in the quasar phase plays a crucial role in massive galaxy evolution. We propose to obtain ALMA band 6 continuum and CO (6-5) observations of a sample of 10 quasars at z~2 with existing high-resolution HST imaging. This unique sample will allow the first simultaneous study of BH growth in high-redshift quasars together with stellar population, molecular gas and star formation in their host galaxies: ALMA observations is the only way to directly probe the total star formation rate, gas mass and gas kinematics, while HST imaging and ground-based spectroscopy measure the host galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, as well as mass and accretion rate of the central BH. We will study whether quasar host galaxies follow the same star formation vs. stellar mass main sequence as star forming galaxies, whether their star formation process is enhanced by mergers or suppressed by BH activity. We will also determine the galaxy gas content and gas fraction in the quasar phase. Our observations will provide direct constraints on the mode of star formation and feedback during the peak epoch of BH growth, shedding light on the origin of BH/galaxy mass correlation.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas in Debris Disks: Resolving the Disk around 49 Ceti. The dispersal of primordial gas and dust from debris disks sets the timescale for planet formation and is closely intertwined with our understanding of the physical processes that shape planetary systems. While it is generally assumed that molecular gas dissipates before the debris disk stage, the nearby A star 49 Ceti is one of only three systems known to host a tenuous, second-generation debris disk while still retaining a substantial molecular gas reservoir. As the oldest, closest, and best-studied of the three, it is the best target for detailed follow up to elucidate the excitation, chemistry, and kinematics of the gas and dust, as well as to determine whether the gas is primordial or released from evaporating comets. SMA observations in the CO(2-1) line hinted at a surprisingly complex and extended gas disk, but were not sensitive enough to detect continuum emission from the dust. Here we propose to spatially resolve the dust disk for the first time and improve upon the molecular gas observations by an order of magnitude in both sensitivity and spectral resolution. Our objectives are the following: (1) By spatially resolving the dust disk, we will determine whether the gas traces the dust, providing unique insight into the relative dispersal rates and processes of the gas and dust components. (2) By observing CO(3-2) emission at high spectral and spatial resolution we will measure the temperature and density structure of the gas disk and the gas-to-dust ratio. We will also examine the disk kinematics in exquisite detail, following up on the deviations from Keplerian rotation hinted at by the SMA observations. (3) HCN observations in combination with thermo-chemical disk models will allow us to investigate the anomalous C/O ratio hinted at by Herschel observations, and to determine whether the molecular gas is primordial or second-generation (cometary). ALMAs unprecedented sensitivity and resolution will allow us to address basic questions in a field that is starved for information about the enigmatic liminal stage between protoplanetary and debris disks.',\n"," 'Putting kinematic planetary detection techniques to the test in HD 97048. The velocity \"kink\" kinematic signature has gained standing as a promising method for discovering embedded planets. The gravitational influence of a planetary perturber is predicted to drive spiral wakes that disturb the surrounding gas velocity, generating distinct \"kinks\" along the spiral arms in observed velocity channel maps of gas emission. The understanding that velocity kinks are due to spiral arms enables us to make a robust prediction: Every instance of velocity kinks should be concurrent with spiral density waves in other tracers. We propose to search the Band 3 continuum for the spiral wake responsible for the observed velocity kink in the HD 97048 disk. The perturber, HD 97048 b, has already been listed in NASAs exoplanet archive as a confirmed ~2 Jupiter-mass planet. Our observing setup has been carefully designed such that we will be able to draw definitive conclusions as to whether a continuum spiral is present, in the case of a non-detection. Our program will provide an independent verification for the existence of the predicted planet, and more importantly, test the validity of velocity \"kinks\" as signposts of planets in disks.',\n"," 'The ALMA-SPT Redshift Survey. Recent ground and space-based multiwavength (sub)millimeter surveys covering hundreds of square degrees have discovered a large number of strongly lensed, ultra-bright submm galaxies (SMGs). The largest of these, by nearly an order of magnitude at present, is the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, which covers 1300 square degrees. The unparalleled SPT sky area makes it the survey most adept at locating the brightest of the brightest of this new population. Its 1.4mm detection wavelength ensures a uniform source selection function across z=1-8. Both aspects make SPT the ideal survey to uncover substantial numbers of the elusive z>4 SMG population. We are carrying out a major multi-wavelength (optical to mm) observating campaign aimed at characterizing the SPT sources in terms dust/gas content, star-formation rates and stellar masses. The most urgently missing information are the redshifts. With the advent of ALMA, even in the early science configuration, unbiased redshift searches for these bright high-z sources are possible in a revolutionary small amount time (3-4 redshifts per hour even in moderate observing conditions). We propose to observe the 26 brightest SMGs selected from the SPT survey. Our proposed observations are designed to obtain unambiguous and unbiased redshifts out to z=6, and as such will sample the high redshift tail of SMGs for the first time.',\n"," 'Mapping the Magnetic Field in the Circumstellar Disk in IRAS 16293-2422 B. Theoretical studies of magnetized cores show that the process of magnetic braking makes it very difficult to form a circumstellar disk in the earliest stages of the collapse. It is therefore important to detect, measure and map the magnetic field structure in the disk around a young stellar object. The SMA observations reported recently by us (Rao et al. 2013) of IRAS 16293-2422 B at 345 GHz are the first such measurements of the field structure in a disk. The field structure appears to be following a pattern which is approximately toroidal in geometry. However the SMA observations are affected by inadequate angular resolution (0.6 arcseconds) and sensitivity (relative position angle error of >7 degrees). We propose to image the magnetic field in the circumstellar disk around IRAS 16293-2422 B using ALMA in Band 6 with an angular resolution of 0.2 arcseconds',\n"," 'Probing the earliest stage of protostellar evolution using the CH3OH lines. We propose to observe the first core candidates B1-bN and B1-bS, and a class 0 protostar B1-c using the ground-state CH3OH 5_k--4_k lines at 241.8 GHz. The goal of this project is to search for the compact CH3OH emission from the first core itself. The chemical model of the first core predicts that CH3OH lines can be the suitable tracer for the first core, because its gas-phase abundance jumps up by three orders of magnitude in the first core. In order to detect the compact emission from the first core, we would like to achieve the angular resolution of 0.2\", which is comparable to the size of the first core. The ALMA band-6 receiver allow us to observe the CH3OH lines in the torsionally excited state at 241 GHz at the same time. The CH3OH lines at two different states would be helpful in studying the physical and chemical conditions of the first core candidates. In addition, we plan to observe the H2CO 3_1,2--2_1,1, HDO 3_1,2--2_2,1 and C17O 2--1 lines in the image sideband. These lines would be helpful in understanding the physical and chemical conditions of the first cores,',\n"," 'Dissecting the magnetic-field morphology at 1000AU of an O-type YSO - Combining the VLBI and ALMA scales. The importance of B-fields for the formation of massive young stellar objects (YSOs) is still uncertain. Observationally, we have gained considerable knowledge on the large scale B-field properties (0.1pc), but we still lack information about the inner few 1000AU. We have recently obtained the first detailed picture of the gas dynamics and B-field configuration within 1000AU of a massive YSO with VLBI maser observations. Our results show a significant correlation between the velocity and B-field vectors for maser spots of a few AU in size (1mas). Towards this YSO, we also conducted SMA observations at a resolution >0.7\" (or 3000AU). We propose ALMA observations, with a resolution of a few 100AU, to bridge the gap between the VLBI and SMA scales. We want to measure the B-field configuration in the inner few 1000AU, through dust polarization, and relate it to the gas dynamics at both the small and large scales from a massive YSO. An ordered B-field morphology aligned across 3 orders of magnitude in spatial scales, down to a massive dusty disk rotating about a massive star, will provide the best possible evidence for a dynamically important role of B-fields in massive star formation.',\n"," 'Investigation of Gas-to-Dust Mass Ratio in the Asymmetric Disk around HD 142527 in Band 3. We propose Band 3 observations of the asymmetrically gapped disk around the Herbig Fe star HD142527 in 13CO/C18O J=1-0 and dust continuum at 100 GHz. Our group made Band 7 observations of the disk in Cycle 0. The continuum emission shows strong asymmetry and is extremely bright (Tb=24 K at 156 AU from the star). There are two possible situations that account for these results: (1) the disk is in gravitationally unstable state to form a gaseous planet, or (2) dust grains are highly accumulated to form a rocky planetary core. The key parameter to judge which is the case is gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d). Our analyses of g/d with disk modeling suggests that g/d in the regions of lowest surface densities may change significantly in radial direction. However, g/d in most regions of the disk cannot be determined solely from Band 7 observations, because J=3-2 lines of 13CO and C18O are optically thick. The disk should be much more transparent to the J=1-0 lines of CO and dust continuum emission in Band 3, allowing us to better estimate g/d and size distribution of dust particles in the entire regions of the disk.',\n"," 'A search for the elusive sub-mm polarisation in protostellar disks. We propose to use ALMA in its narrow-field polarimetry mode to detect sub-mm polarized emission for the first time in a protoplanetary disk. ALMAs high resolution will avoid smearing out of the polarized signal, giving a 5x improvement in beam size and a factor of 100 improvement on the polarised flux over previous studies. The well-studied nearby disk HD163296 is ideal for this work, and we will image the polarisation out to a radius of 145AU to 0.3% rms, giving 60 vectors over the map and 12-15 vectors at the ALMA polarisation sensitivity limit of 0.1% (out to 100AU radius). The orientation and structure of polarisation vectors will allow us to pinpoint the grain alignment mechanism and the degree of alignment and grain non-sphericity. Even a non-detection will provide stringent limit on the shape of mm-sized grains, turbulent mechanisms hampering grain alignment and upper limits to alignment mechanisms.',\n"," 'Exploring quick line and continuum variations in IRC+10216. Millimeter line variation is a new direction of evolved star research. The stable array configuration of ALMA ACA makes it the best millimeter interferomter capable of long term high angular resolution monitoring of AGB stars. Based on ALMA archive data analysis of the archetypal carbon star IRC +10216, we have found possible non-sinusoidal variation patterns, secular trends, and short time oscillations of 1.1mm continuum and line fluxes. The short time variation could be the signature of shock activities in the AGB wind launching region. We propose to perform in Cycle 8 a combination of low (once per month) and high (once per week) cadence ACA-alone monitoring of the star in the same 1.1mm wavelength ranges as in the archival ACA data. We aim at determining the periodicity of these temporal behaviors and characterizing the short term variations. The data will provide unique constraints on complex excitation conditions in the AGB extended atmosphere and inform time dependent AGB wind models.',\n"," 'Measuring the radial profile of the maximum grain size in the 4-planet CI Tau system. CI Tau is the only example of a young hot Jupiter in a disc bearing system and our Cycle 4 high resolution data has demonstrated the presence of three annular gaps in the Band 6 images suggesting the presence of three further giant planets at orbital radii of 13, 39 and 100 au. It thus represents the most fully fledged protoplanetary system ever detected with its planets spanning a record factor 1000 in orbital radius. Interpretation of this spectacular image however requires a knowledge of the radial profile of maximum grain size in the disc to (i) estimate the dust opacity (thus the dust surface density) and (ii) to assess the level of coupling between dust and gas across the disc. The requested Band 3 observations at a resolution of 7 au will allow us to readily distinguish two scenarios: one in which the grains are small and well coupled to the gas (and thus where the dust to gas ratio does not vary radially) and the commonly adopted scenario where the grains have grown to mm sizes. Distinguishing these scenarios is essential in order to characterise this system, to quantify the discs budget of dust and gas and to refine estimates of the planetary masses involved.',\n"," 'Architecture and disk structure in a high-mass protobinary system. High-mass stars exhibit a significantly higher multiplicity frequency than low-mass stars, likely reflecting differences in their formation mechanism. Theoretical work suggests that the high-mass binaries might form via the fragmentation of self-gravitational disks or alternative scenarios such as disk-assisted capture. Intriguingly, in recent VLTI/AMBER near-infrared interferometric observations we detected a close high-mass protobinary with a 57mas (approx. 170AU) separation. Around the individual stars we resolve near-infrared excess emission that is likely associated with hot dust in circumstellar disks. We characterised the system with SMA sub-mm interferometry and identified a suite of outflow- and disk/envelope-tracing lines that we would like to resolve now with ALMA 40mas-resolution imaging. Our aim is to resolve the circumbinary disk/envelope, to study the signatures of binary-disk interaction, and to search for the accretion streamers that feed the circumstellar disks. We will image the outflow-launching region and determine the dynamical mass of the central objects, providing a first glimpse into the evolution of high-mass multiple systems during the accretion phase.',\n"," 'The Large-Scale Environment of the First Quasars. Virtually all models of early black hole growth postulate that they must evolve from massive seeds and accrete at (super-)Eddington rate most of their life. Consequently, quasars that host billion solar mass black holes should form in the largest overdensities in the early Universe. Despite substantial campaigns in the optical and near-infrared, the predicted overdensities of galaxies around high-redshift quasars have never been detected conclusively, leading the current paradigm into crisis. ALMA observations of z>6 quasars have revealed numerous close (few kpc) companions detected via their redshifted [CII] line. However, these detections only probe the small-scale clustering of quasars and galaxies, leaving the question of whether or not quasars inhabit the first large-scale unanswered.

We propose an ACA+TP (5.5\" resolution) outflow survey of 29 protostars in the Orion clouds observed in high-J CO with Herschel/PACS. The high-J CO line luminosity is a measure of the instantaneous mass outflow rate. In contrast, low-J CO emission is a measure of the time averaged mass outflow rate. For our sample, we have shown that the high-J CO emission exhibits a strong correlation with the protostellar L_bol, demonstrating a linkage between instantaneous mass outflow and mass accretion rates. Analyses of other samples of protostars in low-J CO lines show the time averaged mass outflow rate correlates with L_bol, but surprisingly there is also a steady decline in time averaged mass outflow rate with protostellar age. These observations will directly address the difference between instantaneous and time averaged mass outflow rates using uniform observations of a well-characterized sample of protostars. We will: 1. measure the momentum flux and mechanical luminosity of the outflows; 2. establish their dependence on Lbol and protostellar evolutionary class; and 3. place high- and low-J CO informed constraints on the time evolutionary history of mass accretion in protostars.',\n"," 'Unveiling the nature of a strong H2O absorption in a dusty galaxy at z=4.1. Recently, a strong ortho-H2O absorption in a z=6.4 galaxy was interpreted as an impact of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) by Riechers et al. 2022, and was used to constrain the CMB temperature at z=6.4. Notably, Riecher et al. 2022 concluded that the absorption against the CMB is not detectable at z<5. Nevertheless, we have found a similarly strong H2O absorption in a z=4.1 galaxy with an absorption peak penetrating to negative, which the negative flux is lower than the prediction of Riecher et al. models by 4 orders of magnitude. It is unclear where the huge discrepancy comes from. Outflow+CMB impact is a possible solution to the strong H2O absorption at z=4.1, but this is highly unsure due to the noisy line profile. We propose deep ALMA observation to solidly confirm this absorption with high quality line profile, unveiling the physical structure of the ISM and the possible CMB impact.',\n"," 'Unifying Stars and Gas in Quasar Hosts at z~3 and the Co-Evolution Picture. The physical mechanism of the black hole (BH)-host galaxy co-evolution is one of the most important questions in astrophysics. We propose to extend and complete observations of a unique sample of quasars at z~3, the peak epoch of the active galactic nucleus accretion history. Their host galaxies differ by ~1 dex in their stellar masses M* compared to the BH mass and show significantly different narrow-line region properties traced by their OIII luminosity. These quasars are drawn from 70 quasars whose hosts are studied with Subaru AO-assisted imaging. We detected stellar hosts for 4 and estimated upper limits for the other 3 targets proposed here. By extending our sample to much lower BH masses, these systems can serve as a testbed for the co-evolution mechanism. We will test whether a larger amount of gas is present in the more evolved hosts and hence the expected extreme CO luminosities that will allow spatially and dynamically resolved CO line observations similar to our Cycle 3/4 programs. Together with our M* estimates/limits, we will use the gas and dynamical mass estimates to trace their past and possible future evolution onto the established local BH-host scaling relations.',\n"," 'Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby Galaxies: The Local Galaxy Inventory. We propose to utilize the ACA (7m+TP) to map the full star forming disks of three nearby, large-on-the-sky galaxies (NGC 300, NGC 253, Circinus) in CO(2-1) in order to assess their molecular ISM at scales of individual molecular clouds (50-100 pc). These data will provide key insight into the interplay between galactic environment and cloud-scale molecular gas. These galaxies harbor a range of physical environments, from AGN to nuclear starburst to flocculent spiral, and thus provide a crucial link between the Local Group (where high resolution permits study of sub-cloud scale physics) and the broader galaxy population (which includes a wider range of environments). With these data we will measure GMC properties and scaling relations, cloud lifetimes, and star formation efficiency as a function of the diverse environments found in these galaxies. The resolution, sensitivity, and spatial coverage match those of our ongoing Large Program to map the disks of more distant targets with the 12m array, and so these additional galaxies will both fold into and inform the larger sample while providing context for ongoing and future zoom-in studies.',\n"," 'Forming hub-filament systems: An unbiased study of the gas kinematics of increasingly complex filamentary structures. Converging network of filaments, also known as hub-filament systems (HFSs), are known to host the formation of some of the most massive stars in the Milky Way. However, the physics that link the formation and evolution of HFSs with the formation of massive stars remains unclear. It has recently been proposed that HFSs could come together as the result of clump collapse, while other scenarios, invoke turbulence-driven filament-filament collisions, or cloud-cloud collisions as a formation mechanism. Here, we propose to unveil the time evolution of filamentary structures towards the formation of HFSs. For that purpose, we propose to follow-up with ALMA a complete sample of clumps of varying stages of evolution, with varying filament complexities and masses. In combination with dedicated numerical simulations of cloud evolution, we will use ALMA to map the dense gas kinematics of all clumps to produce time-dependent gas dynamics estimators. With both numerical and observational data in hand, we will in a position to determine what evolutionary path(s) HFSs follow.',\n"," 'Using absorption to constrain the 3D structure of the Galactic center ISM. Our current knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of gas in the center of our Galaxy is significantly incomplete. Uncertainties in the distribution of Galactic center gas are a fundamental limitation to understanding the mass flows responsible for transporting gas from hundreds of parsecs to the scale of the black hole. We propose to make observations of CO absorption toward two dozen HII regions that will directly constrain the distribution of the dense and diffuse CMZ gas in the line of sight direction. These data will break the near/far distance degeneracy for orbital models of the dense CMZ gas and resolve long-standing disagreements about the gas within 20 pc of the central black hole. Quadrupling the number of absorption lines of sight for studying the diffuse molecular gas will also significantly improve our understanding of the extent and geometry of the poorly studied low-density molecular gas, which may be the dominant mass component in this region. The positional information from this study will significantly improve our understanding of gas dynamics in the Galactic center, informing evolutionary models and facilitating comparison with other galaxy nuclei.',\n"," 'The ISM at z~7: Deploying a successfully piloted technique to find the brightest [CII] emitters at z>6.5. Astronomers have long anticipated using [CII] to pursue a physical study of galaxies in the epoch of reionization. Yet current probes with ALMA have had a low yield in identifying bright [CII] emission at z>6. Perhaps this could be due to the almost exclusive targeting of galaxies with spec-zs from Lyman alpha? Seeking a different approach, we recently executed a pilot program pursuing efficient line scans on two luminous galaxies at z~7. Amazingly, with just 1 hour of observations, 2 >=6 sigma [CII] lines were found, exceeding the luminosity of all prior detections in z>6.1 galaxies. The surprising success of our pilot suggests that luminous [CII] galaxies do exist at z>6, but perhaps not in those galaxies showing Lyman-alpha emission. Here we propose to extend our pilot program to target 6 more extremely luminous galaxies at z~7 with precise photometric redshift constraints (leveraging 2 sharp spectral features). Our program would measure redshifts for sources, constrain the masses of the brightest galaxies at z~7, and allow for an extensive suite of follow-up activities.',\n"," 'The sequential star formation towards the IR bright rim of an HII bubble. Despite that optical and infrared (IR) surveys have found active formation of young stellar objects around extended IR bubbles, the details of how the impulse-driven molecular clouds form and how they subsequently fragment and form dense star-forming clumps/cores are not yet clear. IR bright bubble rim N2 is an ideal region for a pilot study on the star formation correlation with the feedback from a morphologically associated OB cluster. Our recent single-dish observations indicate chemical evolutionary sequence towards the dense molecular clumps along this expanding shell of the HII bubble. Aiming at improving our understanding of the star-forming scenario towards these clumps, we are proposing for (1) characterising the multi-scale physical structure and searching for the proof of dynamically evolutionary sequence, by resolving the clumps with the dense gas tracers and the continuum emission at 2 and 3 mm; (2) giving the constraints on the evolutionary status of each clump, by tracing the warm/cold gas and the outflow(s).

We propose 0.2\"-resolution CO[3-2] and 870 um continuum observations of a remarkably dense structure with extended X-ray emission at z = 2.506 recently discovered in COSMOS (Wang+2016, submitted), which is arguably the most distant X-ray detected cluster known to date. This structure is also unique in its high concentration of massive galaxies and enhanced star formation activities, containing 11 massive galaxies (3 AGNs) within a 10\" radius with a combined star formation rate of 3400 Msun/yr. These properties suggest that we are witnessing the rapid formation phase of a dense cluster core, the missing link to understand the build-up of cluster ellipticals. With a single pointing, the proposed observation will spatially resolve the molecular gas and dust distribution for 6 cluster members that were already detected in CO[1-0] with JVLA. This will enable the most comprehensive study of star formation and ISM properties in a dense environment at the key formation epoch of a massive cluster. The extent of gas and dust distribution, the gas kinematics and resolved star formation efficiency will provide crucial constraints on the formation mechanisms of cluster ellipticals.',\n"," 'Mapping molecular gas exposed to strong X-rays, cosmic-rays and shocks of the supernova remnant. Supernova (SN) feedback plays a key role in regulating galaxy evolution and star forming rate.

As the most luminous Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) in the X-ray band and energetic CR accelerator, W49B is an ideal laboratory to study SN feedback in detail. Recently, HCO+ emission and HCO+/CO have been proposed as a potentially useful probe of multi-channel feedback of SNRs onto molecular clouds (MCs). We propose ALMA HCO+ 1-0 and 3-2, and CO 3-2 observations toward W49B, aiming 1) to unveil how MC properties are controlled by X-rays, CRs, and shocks, and 2) to quantify the SNR energy transferred to the MCs.

We propose to obtain deep line spectroscopy and continuum imaging towards the densest protocluster system discovered so far, SPT2349-56 at z=4.3. This system has been recently confirmed, using ALMA in cycle-4, having 13 ULIRGs/SMGs detected in dust-continuum and 9 detected in CO emission within 20\" (integrated SFR of ~10^4 Msun/yr). Since it was found in a blind 1.4-mm survey of 2500 deg^2, it is unlikely there are many other systems like these in the entire sky. The proposed observations are thus essential to obtain an unbiased, coherent census of galaxy population in this truly unique protocluster field. Our main goals are to (i) characterize the environment, by identifying all line emitters down to 0.2mJy over the full LABOCA-detected structure. Given the high density of ULIRGs already detected, we expect to detect a plethora of fainter CO emitting galaxies at z=4.3. Along with our rich complimentary data, this proposal will enable a full characterization of the protocluster galaxy properties (gas, dynamical and stellar masses; multi-line diagnostics of the ISM).',\n"," 'Water emission from the T Tauri star DG Tau: disk or outflow ?. The quest for the water reservoir in protoplanetary disks is crucial to understand the origin of oceans on terrestrial planets. We detected with Herschel/HIFI the fundamental lines of ortho- and para-H2O at 557 GHz and 1113 GHz towards a young T Tauri star, DG Tau. Both lines show a double-peaked profile consistent with emission from the warm disk surface out to ~90 AU. Surprisingly, the emission is ~20 times brighter than in the other T Tauri disk detected so far in these lines (TW Hya). However, the interpretation is limited by the low angular resolution of Herschel (beam ~19\"-38\") which does not allow to rule out possible contamination from a molecular outflow. We propose to obtain observations of DG Tau with ALMA in the H218O line at 203.4 GHz at ~0.3\"-1.8\". This will allow us to detect water emission down to a sensitivity of 0.5 mJy and to recover the line profile, hence to understand if the emission originates from the disk (compact emission showing double-peaked profile with ~14 km/s peak separation) or from the outflow (possibly extended emission showing high-velocity blue-/red-shifted wings) and to quantify the amount of water in the disk/outflow.',\n"," 'Recovering the flux lost toward VY CMa. VY CMa is the best studied Red Supergiant stars. Its study is shedding light to the mass loss processes which drive the mass ejection in this phase of the massive star evolution, and its ejecta allow us to understand the dust formation in O-rich environments with elemental abundances dominated by the hot-bottom burning and the third dredge up. However, to obtain an accurate view of both the shaping and chemical processes taking place in this star we must recover the flux lost in previous ALMA observations. The aim of this proposal is to complement these ALMA data with short-spacing visibilities to recover the emission from the most extended components and to be able to obtain the most complete understanding of the aforementioned processes.',\n"," 'Disentangling the fibers of L1495/B213. Filamentary structures dominate the large-scale images of clouds made with Spitzer and Herschel, and suggest that star formation is associated to the process of filamentary fragmentation. Spitzer and Herschel images, however, only trace the distribution of dust, and therefore lack information on the gas velocity field. When this information is added, using molecular line observations, many filaments are found to be in fact complex networks of smaller structures often called fibers. These fibers seem to be the true parent structures of the dense cores and protostars, and therefore the ultimate place of star formation. In this proposal we request ALMA time to observe the most nearby group of fibers, located in the L1495/B213 region of Taurus. Our C18O(1--0) observations will aim to disentangle a surprisingly complex network of fibers that seem to be at a very early evolutionary state. With these observations we aim to characterize the internal properties of the fibers, and to shed some light on their not-yet-understood process of formation.',\n"," 'Masses of Low Mass T Tauri Stars. We propose to measure the masses of young (<10 MY old) low-mass (<0.5 solar masses) stars by the rotation of their circumstellar disks. The improvements in the understanding of the evolution of young stars that result from the proposed research will enable astronomers to obtain a more reliable understanding of the mass spectra of the stars produced in star forming regions and of the chronology of their formation.',\n"," 'A Possible Source of 15N: Observations of Planetary Nebulae with Potential J-Type Progenitors. Isotopic ratios provide a window into the nucleosynthetic processes which have molded the chemical composition of evolved stars. Recent measurements of 12C/13C ratios in several planetary nebulae (PNe) are indicative of J-type stars, whose low 12C/13C ratios are difficult to reconcile with existing nucleosynthetic models. One suggested alternative is a helium flash which results in a flash production and ejection of 13C and 15N. The recent discovery of an extremely 15N-enriched PN showing signatures of a J-type progenitor by Schmidt et al. lends credence to this idea, and suggests that these objects could be important sources of 15N in the Galaxy. In order to explore this idea, we propose to image several PNe with potential J-type progenitors in transitions of HCN, H13CN, and HC15N at Band 6. By comparing the distributions of 12C and 13C across the nebulae and exploring the kinematic structure of the outflows, we may elucidate the nucleosynthetic processes resulting in such ratios. Further, the detection or non-detection of HC15N may allow us to analyze the viability of the helium flash as a model which explains the observed properties of J-type stars.',\n"," 'B3 observation of a super-deep field in HDF-S. The HDF-S field has many orbits of HST data as well as optical/NIR followup, but almost no coverage from ALMA. Observing a blank field inside HDF-S that goes deeper than any existing sub-mm observations in the more subscribed fields could motivate the community to apply in the future for observations in this range of hour angles (HDF-S is located at 22:32:56.22, -60:33:02.69), and will add value to existing optical and NIR observations. This RA is the least subscribed range in long-baseline configurations. Having a sub-mm flux measurement or even flux upper limit could help studies of galaxy number counts, spectral energy distribution fitting, or simply providing high redshift galaxy targets to followup which are located in a field not yet extensively observed at these frequencies, and having a lower observational pressure at the telescope.',\n"," 'ALMA Observations of Dusty AGNs in Dwarf Galaxies. While AGNs have now been found in hundreds of dwarf galaxies, very little is known about the molecular gas and dust that can fuel and obscure the black holes in these objects. Here we propose sensitive, high-resolution (~0.1 arcsecond) ALMA Band 6 observations of 3 dwarf galaxies hosting dusty AGNs identified by their mid-IR colors, optical emission line ratios, and X-ray luminosities. We aim to directly detect the CO (2-1) line and dust continuum in the immediate vicinity of the AGNs and disentangle this emission from that of the host galaxies on larger scales. With the proposed observations, we will 1) determine the mass, morphology, and kinematics of the cold molecular gas in our target dwarf galaxies hosting AGNs, and 2) measure emission from the dusty tori at mm wavelengths and construct the AGN SEDs in combination with existing observations at infrared to X-ray wavelengths from WISE, HST, and Chandra. Ultimately, this project will provide valuable information on black hole feeding and feedback, as well as the panchromatic energy output of AGNs in the relatively unexplored low-mass regime.',\n"," 'Spatially resolved deep submm follow-up of z > 6 low-luminosity quasars with approved JWSTs stellar light observations. In this program, we will measure [CII] and FIR continuum emission of a sample of 8 low-luminosity quasars at z > 6. All of our sample will be observed by JWST to robustly measure the stellar light of their host galaxies. Combined with the stellar mass data, we will discuss the location of these quasars relative to the star-forming main sequence. Our high resoliution (0.3\") observations will also provide a spatially resolved picture of specific star formation rate. These will tell if the quasar feedback (quenching) is in action particularly around the nucleus. As these quasars are likely to be hosted by lower mass galaxies, we can perform a fair comparison of the host galaxy properties with non-AGN normal galaxies (such as provided by ALPINE and REBELS programs studying at comparable cosmic times): we will identify the distinctive properties of quasar hosts, which is crucial to understand the triggering mechanism of quasar activity. Owing to the high resolution, we will also perform dynamical modelings of the host galaxies to obtain their dynamical masses. With these, we will test the usual assumption in z > 6 quasar studies, dynamical mass ~ stellar mass.',\n"," 'High-Resolution Mapping of Titans Atmospheric Composition, Dynamics and Temperature Near Southern Winter Solstice in Synergy with Cassini. We propose to conduct a detailed characterization of the thermal, chemical, and dynamical state of Titans atmosphere near southern winter solstice. Using three Band 7 tunings at 0.14\" resolution we propose to: * determine vertical and latitudinal distributions of all known compounds detected at submm wavelengths * constrain overall dynamics using distributions of trace species while directly measuring zonal+meridional wind components from 300 to 900 km altitude * determine thermospheric temperatures at 600-900 km altitude using HCN hyperfine components and independently using CO and HC3N * determine precise isotopic ratios in CO, HCN and other nitriles * investigate changes occurring in the south polar region, including dramatic enrichments in many constituents and potential detection of new molecules, isomers, and isotopologues. These observations will come towards the end of the Cassini Solstice Mission and will provide important and unique cross-calibration checks between Cassini and ALMA measurements. Ultimately this will allow ALMA to expand, improve upon, and extend the rich legacy of Titan atmospheric studies through an entire Titan year.',\n"," 'Revealing overdensities and early-stage mergers in the Submillimeter Galaxy population. Early theoretical works predict a population of early-stage mergers in overdense environments within the Submillimeter Galaxy (SMG) population. Nevertheless, the observational evidence for these interactions has been scarce, and the influence of the environment on their star formation process is still not fully understood. Combining large-area surveys carried out with Herschel with new ALMA and AzTEC imaging we have built a sample of 5 galaxy-pair SMGs candidates, which are likely early-stage mergers. Here, we request band 3 and band 4 observations to perform a blind spectral scan in order to: (1) confirm the nature of these systems and find new associated sources; (2) test the predictions of various theoretical works on the nature of the SMG population; and (3) characterize the star formation process during the earliest stages of galaxy interactions. This project will provide the first confirmed sample of early-stage mergers and reveal high-redshift protocluster structures rich in extreme star-forming galaxies, ultimately shedding light on the influence of the environment on the star formation process.',\n"," 'Map molecular cloud chemistry and turbulence across a spiral arm of M83. Both molecular cloud (MC) chemistry and interstellar turbulence are tightly related to the dynamics of spiral arms. Our gas-grain chemical modeling of MC evolution through a spiral arm has already predicted significant chemical differences between upstream/downstream clouds. However, the chemical differences of MCs and distribution of turbulence between spiral arms and upstream/downstream interarm regions are difficult to investigate in the Milky Way due to our location in the Galactic plane. We use ALMA to map CO, SO, H2CO and CH3OH lines around the the eastern arm of the face-on southern spiral galaxy M83 to investigate the environment dependent cloud chemistry and turbulence properties and to test our chemical models. The results shall be also instructive to the study back in Milky Way.',\n"," 'Molecular shocks in the nucelar region of NGC 4038 (Antennae galaxies). Numerical simulations of galaxy mergers have predicted the ubiquitous presence of gas inflows into the nuclear region. The inflowing gas could collide with gas component associated with the nuclear region, causing molecular shocks, and the gas density increases rapidly. From our previous observations with ALMA, we find a signature of gas inflow and molecular shocks in the nuclear region of NGC 4038. We suggest that the molecular shocks may be caused by collisions between the inflowing gas and the central massive molecular complex. The main purpose of this proposal is to quantify the density of molecular gas in the shock region. We thus propose to image the nuclear region of NGC 4038 in the three dense/shocked gas at 50 pc scale. We will compare the density of molecular gas in the shock regions with the other regions to confirm, observationally, the scenario that the density of molecular gas increases in the shock region created by merger-induced gas inflows. Furthermore, we found that the distributions of CH3OH and HNCO are slightly different in the nuclear region of NGC 4038. We also aim to investigate the origin of the different distributions of these two shock tracers.',\n"," 'Searching for feedback with 3D multi-phase interstellar medium study in z~2 quasar host galaxies. Luminous quasars are a thousand times more prevalent at z=2 than present day. This rapid period of super-massive black hole accretion coincides with the peak period of galaxy growth. Yet the effects of quasar activity on their host galaxies are still poorly constrained by observations. We are conducting a distant quasar host galaxy survey using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) and adaptive optics (AO) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The advent of near-infrared IFS with AO allows studying morphology and dynamics of the ionized gas in quasar host galaxies. For cycle 5 we are proposing to observe the cold molecular gas reservoir of five z = 1.5 - 2.3 quasar host galaxies through CO J=3-2 or J=4-3 emission redshifted into band 4. Our sample contains quasars that have rich multi-wavelength data sets and have shown evidence of powerful extended ionized outflows. These outflows coincide with regions of low star formation. Critical high-resolution ALMA observations will allow us to investigate if molecular gas is absent in these outflow regions. Together with the lack of detected star formation, this will suggest for quenching of star formation due to negative quasar feedback.',\n"," 'Characterizing the accretion structures around the HMYSOs in W51. The formation process of the most massive O-type stars is one of the main open issues in star formation. There has not yet been a clear detection of a Keplerian accretion disk reported around an O-type forming star. We recently observed accretion structures on ~1000 AU (0.15\", resolution 0.04\") scales at 1.1 mm, but these structures are far more disordered than the disks seen around low-mass stars. The presence of outflows indicates that the structures are linked to disks on small scales (<500 AU). However, with existing 1 mm data, ths innermost region is obscured by optically thick dust. We propose to image the accretion structures in three well-known high-mass (>20 solar masses) forming stars massive star-forming complex W51 and address the following questions: (1) What are the kinematics on scales <500 AU, where the dust is optically thick at 1 mm but thin at 3 mm? (2) How much of the continuum emission seen on 300 AU scales is free-free emission from ionized gas? What fraction, if any, of the disk is ionized? Are the outflows from these high-mass protostars ionized? (3) Are there large grains in the accretion flow or around the disk?',\n"," 'Ice Desorption Illuminating Hidden Planetary Companions. In the early phases of planet formation, young gas-giants still embedded in their parent disks are luminous, ~(1-10) x 10^-4 Lsun, both during the accretion phase and immediately after (within a few Myr). Using 3D chemical models, we found that these planets provide more than enough heat to locally sublimate ices, thereby creating a unique gas phase signature surrounding the planet itself, spanning ~5 AU for a Jupiter-mass protoplanet. Furthermore, the relevant chemical processes (freeze-out and thermal desorption) are rapid compared to disk rotation, and thus the signature follows the planet in its orbit. We propose to apply this chemical imaging technique to search for young, Jupiter-mass planets in the TW Hya protoplanetary disk, where fine-scale ringed structure was recently discovered with ALMA (Andrews et al. 2016), perhaps indicative of the early stages of planet growth. By looking for the youngest planets (i.e., ones that are either just beginning to form gaps or have not yet cleared their orbits), we can put unique constraints on the driving mechanisms of planet formation in disks around solar-type stars.',\n"," 'Water as a tracer of the ISM conditions in high-z active galaxies: A pilot study on hot dust obscured galaxies.. Water is the third most abundant molecule in galaxies, after CO, and in recent years it has proved to be a valuable tracer of the ISM conditions in low redshift galaxies. Up to now the high redshift detections have been few and limited to lensed sub-mm galaxies, but in our recent ALMA observations of two hot dust obscured galaxies (HotDOGs) we serendipitously detected water transitions. Here we propose a follow up on these sources, targeting three different water transitions, the combination of which will help identify the different components of the ISM. HotDOGs are ideal for such a study, as they are going through intence star-formation and BH growth, with high levels of obscuration. They have been proposed to represent the transitional phase between the starburst and quasar phases of popular galaxy evolution models. This pilot study will allow us to demonstrate the power of using water as a molecular gas tracer at high-z, and will allow for the design of representative future studies.',\n"," 'Resolving kinematics of a giant gas disk at a z=3 protocluster core using [CII]. Submillimeter-bright galaxies (SMGs) are dusty, gas-rich, high-z galaxies that show intense starburst activity. SMGs are possible progenitor of early type galaxies in the center of the cluster in the local Universe, and thus SMGs in a proto-cluster in the early Universe can play a key role in understanding the formation and evolution of the most massive galaxies across cosmic time. Here we propose a deep [CII] imaging of a bright SMG located at the z=3.1 SSA22 proto-cluster core. The CO(3-2) emission reveals a giant gas disk on more than 30 kpc scale, and the suggested rotation velocity is about 600 km/s. These characteristics, together with the proto-cluster environment, make the SMG an important target. Using the bright [CII] line as a reliable tracer, we will uncover gas kinematics of the gigantic gas disk at z=3, and how the proto-cluster environment influences the growth of galaxies and SMBHs in the early epoch.',\n"," 'Adjusting the Reception of The Antennae: A Clear Look at GMCs in a Major Merger. We propose to map the nearest major merger, the Antennae, in CO (1-0) and (2-1) at giant molecular clouds scales (~40 pc). This iconic system was targeted during ALMA commissioning, but does not yet have a high fidelity, high resolution map of the entire system in a CO line. With active star formation spread out across a range of environments, the Antennae is an excellent proxy for star-forming galaxies and galaxy mergers at moderate redshifts (z=1-2). Using the proposed observations, we will build a catalogue of GMCs with measured properties (radius, linewidth, luminosity), determine the factors driving the formation of super-giant molecular clouds, study the CO(2-1)/(1-0) line ratio and its variations from cloud to galaxy scales, and measure the CO-to-H2 conversion factor for both CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines. These observations provide the first high fidelity maps of the molecular gas in the Antenna from the cloud scale up to the full extent of the interacting galaxy disks.',\n"," 'High resolution characterization of early bulge structure and feedback in a z = 7.07 low-luminosity quasar. Recent ALMA observations of [CII] emission toward the z=7.07 low-luminosity quasar, J1243+0100, have shown following outstanding features: (1) massive host galaxy likely associated with a massive, compact bulge, and (2) fast AGN-driven [CII] outflow. However, due to the limited resolution of the previous work (0.7\"), it was difficult to provide firm evidence of the bulge, as well as to investigate detailed properties of the [CII] outflow. In this program (0.23\" resolution), we will spatially resolve these intriguing structures at [CII]. We will deliver the following. (1) Detailed gas dynamics: we will measure the rotation curve at r < 2 kpc of this quasar. By firmly capturing a steep rise in this curve, we can characterize the massive bulge even at z ~7. (2) Mapping the [CII] outflow: we will estimate various outflow properties as a function of the distance from the nucleus, providing a more faithful view on the nature of this AGN feedback. (3) Detailed gas distribution: We can compare the gas distribution of J1243+0100 with those of luminous quasars to study what is critically different between luminous and low-luminosity quasars on scales of kpc.',\n"," 'Detection of a circumbinary disk around the high-mass protostar G 014.23-00.50 showing periodic flux variability. We propose continuum and CH3CN/SiO thermal line observations in band 3 to detect a circumbinary disk around the high-mass protostar (HMP) G 014.23-00.50, which has shown flaring flux variations with the period of 23.9 days (the shortest so far). The evolutionary sequence of HMPs is still under debate because the mass accretion rate onto the stellar surface, where is directly unreachable tiny area even with ALMA, is the most significant factor to define evolutionary tracks. To understand the accretion rate in such a tiny area, periodic flux variability observed mainly in CH3OH masers around HMPs is the most powerful probe in terms of its time-scales from a few tens to a few hundreds days, corresponding to the spatial scales of 0.1-1 au (e.g., under the condition of Keplerian rotation). The periodic flares in the target source G 014.23 might be explained by a variation of the dust temperature at the maser emitting region on a circumbinary disk. As the first step in series to challenge flux monitor observations with ALMA in the next cycle, here we would like to detect a compact and spatially resolved object with evidence of a binary, which could be interpreted as a circumbinary disk.',\n"," 'Structural Evolution of Molecular Clouds Triggered by Supergiant Shells in LMC. We propose 12CO J=1-0 mapping observations of twenty molecular clouds along the \"molecular ridge\" in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our aim is to illustrate the evolution of molecular clouds in the viewpoint of development of internal compact structures (which are directly relevant to star/cluster formation) and investigate the mechanisms that underlie the evolution -- in the LMC, the most likely trigger is interactions with supergiant shells (SGSs). The northern part of the ridge is a site of ongoing interaction between the gas and expanding (east to west) SGS, while its southern part is not associated with any known SGS. Therefore the ridge is an ideal target to test the SGS-induced evolution of the clouds. We expect that the proposed high-resolution (0.5 pc) high-fidelity images, obtained by combining the 12-m, 7-m, and TP Arrays, reveal the north-to-south (and potentially east-to-west) transition of internal structures of the clouds.',\n"," 'The early evolution of super star clusters in the nuclear starburst of NGC 4945. We propose to use the unparalleled capabilities of ALMA to perform Band 7 imaging and spectroscopy of NGC4945, the nearest archetypal example of a starburst and AGN (Sy 2) nucleus. ALMA Band 3 imaging and recombination line observations have revealed the presence of super star clusters (SSCs) in the central starburst, which are highly obscured at NIR wavelengths. However, the Band 3 observations lack the sensitivity to identify the full cluster population and lack molecular spectroscopy probing the very-dense, cluster environment. Band 7 spectroscopy at 1.8 pc resolution of CS 7-6 and H13CN 4-3 from highly-excited dense gas will allow us to determine the kinematics, virial mass, and radial momentum associated with each cluster. We will also obtain Band 7 continuum imaging to trace the dust, a mass-dominant component of SSCs, and its spectral index, an indicator of the dust opacity and therefore feedback from dust-processed radiation pressure. The proposed observations enable the next steps in our understanding of the formation and evolution of young, massive clusters.',\n"," 'Studies of disk+outflow systems in high-mass star formation with KaVA and ALMA. We propose a survey of high-mass young stellar objects (HM-YSOs) associated with the 22 GHz H2O masers to investigate physical properties of their disk+outflow systems. We have been conducting monitoring observations of the 22 GHz H2O masers toward 17 HM-YSOs to investigate 3D velocity structures of outflows in the KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) Large Program. In the proposed ALMA Band 6 observations, we will identify powering sources of outflows traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers and obtain their physical properties using dust continuum. In addition, we will observe molecular lines to reveal spatial and velocity structures. Thermal lines of CH3OH and HCOOCH3, and 213 GHz class II CH3OH maser trace disks, while thermal SiO and 229 GHz class I CH3OH masers probe outflows. They will be used to fill the gap between central HM-YSOs and maser distributions emitted in the outflows. We can derive physical parameters such as dynamical time scale, mass loss rate, mass accretion rate, etc, by combining the KaVA proper motion measurements. These comprehensive studies will be compared with theoretical models to understand mass accretion through disks, mass ejection, and feedback to the ambient gas.',\n"," 'The cold debris disk in the unique multi-planetary system around HR 8799. HR 8799 is the only multi-planet system with direct imaging available, and its debris disk is a prime ALMA target to understand how planetary systems form and evolve. We propose to observe continuum emission of the cold debris disk of HR 8799 at 230 GHz (Band 6) in order to (1) determine the disk structure probing for signatures of resonant structures, asymmetries and spiral structure; (2) constrain the unknown disk inclination; and (3) determine accurately the inner disk edge. We will determine the disk structure with unpredecented accuracy and will compare the observed structure with the predictions of models. The data will be combined with matched resolution data at 345 GHz (Band 7) from a Cycle 0 progam if it gets completed. The two datasets will allow to contrast the disk at two different wavelengths, allowing tighter constraints on the nature of any observed structure. Finally, our program will provide a first epoch at 230 GHz for the exploration of orbital motion of any observed structures.',\n"," 'Filamentary streamers, accretion flows, multiplicity and disks in the proto-O star W33A. We propose to follow-up our Cycle 1 (delivered in Cycle 2) observations to fully trace the 3D velocity field of the material accreting onto a newly forming O-star. Our target, W33A, a proto-O-star, is nearby (2.4 kpc) and well studied, already having a rare combination of high resolution observations at near-IR (Gemini-AO- 0.13\") and mid-IR (VLTI-MIDI - 0.04\") plus our Cycle 1 data (~0.3\"). Our ALMA data show a spiral filament feeding material to the central region, where the velocity profile show signs of rotation, suggesting the O-star is forming via a disk. This `disk appears disrupted by infalling streams (we find at one on 1000au scales - Maud et al. 2017 MNRAS 472 120), fragmentation due to gravitational instability, or interaction with companions. However, we have not yet resolved the disk scales <500au of the system to determine which is the case. Our 3D radiative transfer models (dust & gas) including infall from the outer rotating envelope onto a compact system best matches the binary scenario (disk radii <250au). ALMA will reveal the answer, as it is the only instrument that can zoom in and image the sub-100au scales, allowing us to test massive star formation theories.',\n"," 'Redshifts of bright Herschel gravitational lenses. We propose to continue our successful ACA CO redshift measurements of 30 of the brightest (S500m > 0.1 Jy) strongly gravitationally lensed submm galaxies from the Herschel ATLAS, plus 3 bright ACT mm-wave sources. These simple observations, ideal for the ACA, will double the sample size of H-ATLAS background source redshifts, complementing our long-term 8m-class foreground lens redshift campaigns. Our pioneering lens selection (Negrello et al. 2010 Science) has an astonishing ~100% efficiency and the gravitational amplification makes CO line detection up to ~100× faster than in unlensed surveys. We will provide spectroscopic confirmation of gravitational lensing, by finding submm redshifts that are clearly higher than the redshifts of the lensing masses. This on its own is already enough to make statistical constraints on the dark matter halo profiles. Combined with our ongoing multi-wavelength campaigns, we will start placing direct constraints on the evolving dark matter distribution of the lenses. The joint lens\\xadsource redshift distribution is a key discriminator of cosmological parameters and the evolution of dark matter haloes.',\n"," 'A heavy-element radio recombination line towards a post-AGB object?. We have detected a line at 232.024 GHz towards the post-AGB object HD101584 in previous ALMA observations. The only reasonable identification is a 30alpha recombination line of Mg, Si, S, or Fe (or a combination of them). In this proposal we aim to confirm this identification by searching for the 26alpha line at 353.807 GHz in the same object. We support these observations by a radiative transfer model of recombination lines that shows that under certain conditions (reasonable in this context) heavy-element recombination lines can be much stronger than e.g. the corresponding lines of H. If successful, this will be the first detection ever of a radio recombination line towards such a cool object, and it suggests that recombination lines can be used as important tools for studying highly evolved stars (such as post-AGB objects and yellow hypergiants), e.g., magnetic field estimates, spectroscopy of chromospheres, and studies of the atomic envelopes of these objects using ALMA.',\n"," 'Mapping the [NII] 122 micron line in high-z galaxies.. We propose to greatly improve our study of the high-z galaxies SMMJ02399-0136 and H1413-117 (the Cloverleaf QSO) at z=2.81 and z=2.56 respectively, by adding high spatial resolution observations of the redshifted [NII] 122 µm line that only ALMA can provide. We have previously detected this line in these two sources using our instrument ZEUS on the CSO. Both sources reside at the epoch of peak star formation in the Universe and have been extensively studied at other wavelengths. Taking advantage of the resolving power and sensitivity of ALMA ES, we will identify the sources of the [NII] (star formation or AGN), characterize the starburst within each source, and probe the star formation rate/molecular mass relationship.',\n"," 'Resolving the Star-Forming Gas of a Main-Sequence Galaxy at Cosmic Noon. In terms of resolution, observations of molecular gas still lag significantly behind those of the stellar emission at z~2. Thus, crucial questions remain open, e.g.: What were the main sites of star formation at Cosmic Noon? What was the temperature, density and kinetic energy content of the star-forming gas? We propose to start answering these by resolving the CO(2-1) and CO(5-4) emission of a typical z=1.6 main-sequence galaxy, down to a physical resolution of 1kpc. With the proposed CO(2-1) observations, we will identify whether the molecular gas is distributed in a large central reservoir, kpc-size clumps or structures more typical of local galaxies. We will measure the gas velocity dispersion down to 20 km/s allowing us to distinguish between thin and thick disks for the first time at z>1. Additionally, by resolving the CO(5-4) emission we will model radial variations in the temperature and density of the molecular gas, thereby identifying the sites of ongoing star formation. Selected from the HUDF, our target is one of the best-studied main-sequence galaxies at Cosmic Noon and presents the ideal opportunity to connect deep high-resolution multi-wavelength observations.',\n"," 'Hot Water in HL Tau. Low mass protostar HL Tau is the topic of intensive study, in particular since ALMA Long Baseline Campaign observations revealed signs of planet formation in a protoplanetary system < 1 Myr. Here, we seek to followup on a recently-reported detection of hot water towards HL Tau. Water is believed to play a key role in star and planet formation, so understanding the nature of this emission is important. Previously interpreted as due to thermal emission, we believe the observations show indications of maser emission, and request ALMA high angular resolution observations at 321 GHz to confirm this, plus observations at 183, 325 and 658 GHz to enable constrained radiative transfer modeling. The observations will locate the masers in the system - are they associated with shocks in a jet or also in the disk - and can enable mapping of source structures on angular scales much smaller than the beam size. Radiative transfer modeling will provide physical conditions in the jet/disk. It can also measure the ortho:para ratio of water that may have been sputtered off cold dust grains. Detection of water masers towards HL Tau provides a new avenue for the study of low mass protoplanetary systems.',\n"," '[C II]158 micron Emision from Absorption-Selected Galaxies at z ~ 4. A primary science driver of the ALMA observatory is to \"Detect the spectral line emission from CO or CII in a normal galaxy like the Milky Way at $z$=3...\". With this goal in mind, our group has systematically surveyed galaxies in absorption to pursue this objective. Specifically, we have identified damped Lya systems (DLAs), HI-selected galaxies linked to Milky Way progenitors, with strong CII* 1335 absorption at redshifts optimal for 158 micron observations with ALMA. Our Cycle 2 program is an ongoing project targeting z~2 DLAs. With Cycle 3, we transition to z>4 where ALMA observations are far more sensitive. The proposed observations target 3 DLAs drawn from a sample of 35 systems confirmed to have very strong CII* absorption. Together with high metallicity and large kinematic profiles make these systems the ideal candidates for detection with ALMA in the strongest atomic line seen in Milky Way-type galaxies.',\n"," 'Mapping the Interstellar Medium of HI-Rich Galaxies at z~4. We propose to map the [CII] emission of two z~4 star-forming galaxies previously detected in cycle 3. These galaxies were originally targeted due to the presence of a damped Lyman alpha system (DLA) in the spectrum of a nearby quasar. This makes these galaxies unique for several reasons. First, their selection based on absorption means they represent a more typical galaxy at these redshifts. Second, their observed properties can be used to learn more about the difficult-to-observe DLA-galaxy connection. Finally, the kinematics of the DLA can be compared to the kinematics of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy, allowing insight into the interplay between the ISM and HI gas at high redshift. The proposed observations will have resolutions of ~1kpc and ~2kpc allowing us to spatially resolve the emission in both galaxies, and determine: 1) the dynamical mass, and 2) the velocity structure of the ISM of the galaxy. With this data we will -for the first time- provide a direct mass estimate of a galaxy associated with a high redshift DLA, and determine if the HI gas around these high redshift galaxies is inflowing, outflowing or tracing the passive circumgalactic medium.',\n"," 'Feebdack or mergers? Detailed characterisation of an exceptional molecular gas ejection at z=1.4. We propose deep ALMA Band 3 follow-up of ID2299, a massive starburst galaxy at z=1.4 that is expelling a large quantity of molecular gas at ~25000 solar masses per year, as revealed by a broad component detected at 2-6 sigma in CO and [CI] ALMA observations. This object may represent the long-sought observational confirmation of outflow-driven quenching at high-z. However, the triggering mechanism of the ejection is still debated, as a result of the short integration and low resolution of pre-existent data available from ALMA. We thus request a combination of deep medium- (0.8\") and high- (0.2\") resolution observations in CO(2-1), where the ejection is detected with the highest significance, to rule out a two-galaxy merger, measure the ejection parameters (gas mass, spatial centroid, size, kinematics), and rule out whether the broad component traces a merger-driven tidal tail or a feedback-driven wind. The observations requested for this unique target caught in a critical stage of its evolution will shed light on the mechanisms halting star formation in galaxies of the distant Universe.',\n"," 'Protoplanetary Disk Masses and Grain Properties in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Rich clusters are the typical sites of star and planet formation in the Galaxy. Thus, a complete understanding of planet formation requires measuring protoplanetary disk masses in a rich cluster environment. The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the most readily-observable rich cluster. Our team has recently completed an analysis of approximately 100 protoplanetary disks with ALMA at 850 microns (Band 7) from a 1.5 x 1.5 arcminute mosaic of the inner region of the ONC. However, accurate determination of disk masses requires knowledge of the dust grain sizes, which are unconstrained with detections at only one wavelength. We will rectify this by measuring the brightness of these disks at longer wavelengths and computing their spectral indices. Thus, we propose follow-up observations at 3.1 mm (ALMA Band 3) of the same 1.5 x 1.5 arcminute region. Additionally, these longer wavelength flux measurements will more accurately reflect the total dust mass of compact disks that may be partially optically thick at 850 microns. Our observations can also reveal radial variations in grain sizes within these disks, furthering our understanding of dust growth and evolution.',\n"," 'Hot or Cold? Characterizing the temperature structure of young disks in Perseus. In contrast to protoplanetary disks, the physical and chemical conditions of young disks still embedded in their envelopes remain largely uncharacterized. An important unknown is the temperature structure since this strongly affects the disks chemical composition, and therefore the composition of planet-forming material. The more evolved protoplanetary disks have been shown to contain large cold regions where CO is frozen out onto the dust grains, but embedded disks are predicted to be too warm for CO freeze-out. Our recent analysis of the Class 0 disk L1527 suggests that this disk is indeed warm enough to prevent CO freeze-out (van t Hoff et al. 2018). We propose to investigate the temperature structure of six disk candidates in Perseus using observations of DCO+, N2D+ and DCN. Determining whether these young disks are warm or cold will show whether the onset of planet formation happens in a cold environment with CO frozen out, as observed for protoplanetary disks, or in a warm CO gas-rich environment.',\n"," 'Imaging Vibrationally-Excited Molecules in Galaxy Nuclei. We propose very high-resolution (4-11 pc) imaging of lines from vibrationally excited molecules (vib-lines) toward three prototypes of the Compact Obscured Nuclei (CON) of galaxies. A CON hides behind an enormous column of obscuring dust either a heavily Compton-thick AGN of high Eddington ratio or an extreme young, compact starburst, or both. Being radiatively excited by IR photons from hot dust, the vib-lines selectively trace the hot centers of CONs that are hardly visible in usual mm/submm lines because of (self)absorption. We aim to uncover in our targets 1) the distribution of luminosity-tracing vib-lines, 2) gas kinematics in the centers of the CONs, 3) the shapes and sizes of the continuum cores at <10 pc scale. We will then 4) constrain the nature of the CON luminosity sources using the L/M parameter measured with our observations. We use a vib-line that is strongest known, and observe galaxies that are the strongest emitters of the vib-line.',\n"," 'MOLECULAR CLOUDS AND STAR FORMATION IN BAR OF NGC1300. This proposal challenges the long-standing problem in barred galaxies that is why star formation efficiency is much smaller in bar regions than spiral arm regions. Recent high resolution numerical simulations suggest that star formation is suppressed by high velocity cloud-cloud collisions in the bar regions. Cloud collision makes cloud cores, but the high velocity collision causes too short duration for the cores to grow large enough for massive star formation via gas accretion. We detected CO(1-0) emission towards bar and arm regions of the prototype strongly barred galaxy NGC 1300 for the first time with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The observed emission line profiles in the bar and arm are very similar to those of the high resolution simulations, supporting this new scenario. Now we need ALMA observations to test the new scenario by identifying individual molecular cloud and deriving relative velocity distribution of the clouds. We stress that the understanding of physical cause for star formation by cloud collision is also very important to unveil galaxy evolution and formation at high redshifts.',\n"," 'Molecular clumps in a star-forming galaxy at z~1.4. We propose CO(2-1) observations of a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z~1.4, which has several molecular gas clumps in CO(5-4) emission line. Size, molecular gas mass, and velocity width of each clump are estimated to be ~4 kpc or less, ~ 50 km/s, and ~5 x 10^9 Msun, respectively, though the clump sizes are not well constrained. The clumps are considered to be important blocks to build a disk galaxy, particularly bulge. Nevertheless, presence and nature of the molecular gas clumps is not yet well known at high redshifts. Thus unveiling properties of the molecular clumps is inevitable to understand disk galaxy evolution. Since we have CO(5-4) data taken with ALMA, by combining the data, we can derive gas density and size of each clump and test whether the clumps formed via gravitational disk instability. Since CO observations of molecular clumps in a wide range of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is still hard with ALMA, our case study will give us useful insights on formation and evolution of molecular clumps and relation to the clumps seen in other wavelengths.',\n"," 'Time Filler: Feedback Scaling Relations for Gas Infall and Outflows in Massive Starburst Galaxies at Redshifts 1.5-6. ALMA has recently demonstrated that the ground-state OH+ transitions are an ideal tracer of stellar feedback in massive starburst galaxies back to the first billion years of cosmic time based on detections in ~20 systems at redshifts 2-6. Most detections were obtained with the ACA, revealing a mix of red- and blueshifted absorption, emission, P-Cygni, and inverse P-Cygni line profiles, which are characteristic of gas infall and outflows - revealing the gas supply for the starbursts, and the feedback terminating them. These modest samples revealed relationships between the dust temperature and OH+ optical depth, and the OH+ emission strength and far-IR luminosity/star formation rate, but with substantial scatter. Here, we aim to significantly improve the statistical significance of these relations, and to identify the best cases suitable for high-resolution follow-up with the 12m array by targeting 70 of the brightest lensed starbursts across the sky from the SPT, ACT and Planck surveys, with a particular focus on less subscribed LST ranges. Given the simple selection on apparent brightness, sample completion is not essential, making this an ideal time filler project.',\n"," 'Gaia 17bpi: the circumstellar environment of a new FU Ori-type object. FU Orionis-type objects (FUors) are low-mass PMS with outbursts detected at optical and infrared wavelengths. The outbursts are caused by a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate from the circumstellar disk to the star, significantly influencing the final stellar mass. FUors can be Class I or Class II type of objects and, because the eruptions cause significant changes in their environments, it is thought that they play an important role in the transition between Classes. Only a few tens of these objects are known and our target, Gaia 17bpi, is the most recently discovered FUor. This object has not been observed at millimeter wavelengths yet, so we propose the first millimeter wavelength observations of Gaia 17bpi. We request 1.3 mm continuum observations to detect the dust in the disk and the envelope. We also request 12CO, 13CO and C18O observations which will provide information regarding the density of the envelope and can provide a detection of outflows, a common feature FUors. We will also cover a number of more complex molecules to study the chemistry in the circumstellar material.',\n"," 'Tracing the evolution of massive protostars. Recent surveys of the Galactic plane have identified large populations of candidate young massive protostars. However we have a very poor understanding of the actual evolutionary status of these sources. The SED based classification schemes used for nearby low mass objects are, alone, inadequate at the large distances of these high mass objects which are embedded in inhomogeneous environments. Here we propose the first comprehensive, systematic, high angular resolution survey of the chemical (and physical) properties of a well selected sample of 39 young high mass embedded sources. This survey will use a single frequency setting to study a range of organic molecular species which trace the evolution of the circumstellar material as a protostar initially heats its environment. The column density and excitation temperature of these species, together with the dust continuum emission, will be used to study how the properties of the circumstellar molecular gas change with source luminosity, spectral energy distribution and other properties with the goal of identifying evolutionary trends.',\n"," 'Probing the inner-most region of the relativistic jet in extreme TeV blazars. We propose to observe continuum spectrum of five extreme TeV blazars, which are unique probe to study enigmatic extragalactic background light (EBL), for the first time in mm/sub-mm regimes at two frequencies. The goal of this study is to investigate whether their relativistic jets are optically thin at mm wavelengths. Our preparatory study with ALMA shows optically thin mm-spectrum in most normal blazars, contrary to the most accepted \"one-zone SED model\" predicting their relativistic jets are optically thick in mm regime. In addition, our study with VLBI does not favor it also for extreme TeV blazars. If mm emission is optically thin in also extreme TeV blazars, it requires alternative models such as the structured jet model where both of high-energy emission and mm emission can come from the jet base. It will not only give a new picture of jets in blazars, but also affect studies on EBL based on SED models. These sources are faint for other radio interferometers. Furthermore, sequential observation in two bands is necessary for this proposal, since blazars are usually variable within days-weeks at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. Only ALMA cycle-2 can perform proposed observations.',\n"," 'The Shape of Water: Dissecting the ISM in high-redshift dusty starbursts with luminous water emission lines. H2O lines provide a unique diagnostic of the star-forming regions of high-redshift dusty galaxies. Strong gravitational lensing boosts ALMA sensitivity and angular resolution, enabling comprehensive studies of the high-redshift sources down to sub-kpc scales. Our previous studies of global H2O lines has shown that H2O emission is ubiquitously bright in submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). Our modeling shows that the H2O lines originate from highly obscured infrared-luminous regions tightly correlated with star formation. To fully unleash the diagnostic power of H2O lines, we here select the best equatorial lensed SMGs at z~2-4, and propose to image J=2,3,4 H2O lines with 0.2\"-0.3\" resolutions. Through lens models, we will be able to resolve the H2O and dust continuum emission at sub-kpc scales intrinsically. The sample will triple the total number of sources with high-resolution images of the H2O emission in dusty starbursts at any redshift. The multiple H2O lines, together with the bonus CO/[CI] lines, will allow us to further constrain the structure and properties of the heavily obscured star-forming regions and help us understand the star formation conditions in high-redshift SMGs.',\n"," 'Monitoring fast variations of event-horizon scale gas in Sgr A* with frequency switching. Sgr A* in the Galactic Center is by now the best constrained supermassive black hole candidate. Its radio spectrum peaks at submm-waves and its size as measured with VLBI experiments shrinks with increasing frequency, exhibiting a clear size-frequency relation. The Millimeter-wave emission comes from less than four Schwarzschild radii and will allow imaging of the event horizon with mmVLBI in the future. The orbital time scale in Sgr A* is 24 minutes for a Schwarzschild black hole and the source frequently flares at radio, infrared, and X-ray wavelengths on timescales of hours. VLA monitoring has shown that there is a time lag of 20 minutes between flares at lambda 7mm and lambda 13mm, consistent with an outflow model. It is predicted that a lag-frequency relation should exist extending up to the mm-regime, but so far reliable multi-frequency mm-wave monitoring is not available. Here we want to use ALMA in a frequency switching mode to establish the variability properties of Sgr A* at different frequencies on orbital time scales of the black hole. Submm emission is ideal for this, since it is optically thick emission, probing actual bulk plasma motions and densities. X-ray and IR flares are in contrast completely optically thin and hence much more sensitive to particle heating. Hence Alma monitoring may become a powerful tool for understanding Sgr A* and black holes in general. The observation should, for example, establish the lag-frequency relation, which together with the existing size-frequency relation would provide a quantitative tool to constrain flow speed and acceleration of gas within a few Schwarzschild radii of the event horizon. Finally, the integrated data set will provide the best-ever multi-frequency map of the gas streamers (Sgr A West) in the Galactic Center.',\n"," 'Characterising the dust radial segregation in the TW Hydrae protoplanetary disk. We propose to observe the well-known T Tauri star TW Hydrae in Band 3 continuum to provide the first direct measurement of dust radial migration in a disk for a single source. Comparison of SMA (870microns) and ATCA (7mm) observations of the protoplanetary disk around TW Hydra strongly suggests that the larger dust grains (> cm) are concentrated in the inner parts of the disk. ALMA offers a unique opportunity to characterise the details of the mechanisms at play: grain growth and radial migration. We propose to map the continuum emission in Band 3 (2.6mm), intermediate between 870microns and 7mm, and to do so at the same spatial scales as the SMA and ATCA data. With less than 1 hour of total observation time, we will map accurately the spatial distribution of millimeter grains, providing the first quantitative constraints on dust growth and kinematics in protoplanetary disks. These results are expected to provide very significant quantitative constraints on the dust evolution models in disks.',\n"," 'Confirming Deeply Embedded Protostellar Population in the Central Molecular Zone. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties. Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ. However the existing data cannot confirm definitely the protostellar nature of these candidates. We propose to use ALMA, with its unprecedented capability of high sensitivity and high dynamic range, to observe these protostellar candidates. The project, aiming at detecting compact CH3CN emission from natal hot molecular cores, will confirm or reject the presence of embedded protostars. The new observations will provide us a vision of the episodic star formation in the CMZ.',\n"," 'Characterize the protostellar disk population in an IRDC. Protostellar disks play important roles in star formation, and their observed properties set the initial conditions for disk evolution and planet formation. To date surveys of disks in the protostellar phase are mainly limted to relatively evolved nearby regions such as Orion and Perseus, so it is largerly unexplored how the ensemble properties of protostellar disk, e.g., mass and size distributions, would vary in different environments. Here we propose to utilize the long baseline capability of ALMA to conduct a Band~7 survey towards the disk population in a distant massive infrared dark cloud (G14.19), which is in a very early stage of cluster formation. Thus the proposed observation will not only enable us to examine if disk formation undergoes similar regulation in this special physical condition, but also serve as a template and motivate large sample surveys in future.',\n"," 'Revealing the Chicken-and-Egg Problem of the Onset of the Equatorial Density Enhancement in the AGB Mass Loss. We propose to address the long-standing Chicken-and-Egg problem of the onset of the equatorial density enhancement in dusty stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Here the issue is whether the central torus is the consequence of intrinsic bipolar outflows carving out a cavity that defines the bipolar axis or the origin of bipolar outflows steered into the intrinsic biconical openings. We will confront the issue by resolving the velocity structure and the relative 12CO/13CO distribution around the central torus embedded in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of two representative proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe). We will look into how the CO outflow velocity field differs in the two PPNe having different optical morphologies, especially with respect to the latitudinal dependence of the CO ourflows. We also aim at resolving the longitudinal motion to see if the central torus exhibit the Keplerian rotation. The 12C/13C abundance ratio distribution can indicate if the wind material is in motion or in a pause, hinting at the presence of flows. Based on these pieces of dynamical evidence we will determine the role of the central torus during the AGB mass loss.',\n"," 'Calibrating Chemical Tracers of Primordial Gas in Circumstellar Disks. The lifetime of primordial gas in circumstellar disks is a fundamental quantity required for understanding planet formation processes. The uncertainties involved in relating conventional gas tracers, including dust and CO, to the total disk mass increase significantly as the disk evolves. We propose a novel approach using nitrogen-bearing species, specifically N2H+, to track primordial H2 gas. The low levels of available nitrogen incorporated into solid solar-system bodies relative to carbon suggest that nitrogen will remain present in the gas over longer timescales. Elevated N2H+/CO ratios of two Upper Sco disks observed in ALMA Cycle 3 (2015.1.01199.S) support this hypothesis. Here we propose further investigation of the N2/CO ratio at different stages of disk evolution through observations of N2H+ and HCO+ in three mature disks and one transitional disk in Upper Sco (5-11 Myr old) and one debris disk (30 Myr old) with previous CO detections by ALMA. This will provide crucial data regarding the primordial gas content of these evolved systems. Affirmative results would lead to a future survey of a large number of disks to constrain the dissipation timescale of primordial gas.',\n"," 'Cold gas in a cosmic `Spiderweb of proto-galaxies: witnessing the in-situ birth of a giant cluster elliptical?. The largest galaxies in the Universe are giant ellipticals in the cores of galaxy clusters. Simulations predict that their early evolutionary stages (in proto-clusters at z>1) are dominated by rapid gas cooling that triggers \"in-situ\" star-formation. Using ATCA and VLA, we have obtained the first tantalizing observational evidence for this scenario, by detecting and resolving an extended (~80 kpc) reservoir of cold molecular CO(1-0) gas in the massive `Spiderweb radio galaxy at z=2.2. The Spiderweb Galaxy is embedded in a rich proto-cluster and surrounded by a UV-emitting halo that harbors widespread star formation. For the first time, we identified the fuel reservoir that can sustain such widespread star formation. We here propose ALMA observations of [CI](1-0), CO(4-3) and the 600 micron dust to study the physical and chemical properties of the cold IGM across the halo. This will allow us to better understand the nature, origin and evolutionary role of the cold proto-cluster IGM. It may ultimately test theoretical predictions of how gas cooling deep inside the potential wells of high-z proto-clusters shapes the early formation of the most massive galaxies in the Universe.',\n"," 'HMSFSiO. We propose ALMA high-angular resolution and high sensitivity observations of SiO v=1, J=2-1 maser lines toward new SiO maser sources of 2 high-mass star-forming regions, G19.61-0.24A and G75.78+0.34 which are detected by the Korean VLBI Network single dish telescope. Through the ALMA observations, we investigate the exact positions and spatial distributions of SiO v=1, J=2-1 maser emission. We also expect to investigate the inner part of jets/outflows which regions are playing an important role for launching and collimating the jets/outflows probably related with rotating accretion disks close to the central protostars. In addition, the observational results of several transitions of CH3OH masers, SiO thermal emission, and continuum etc. are compared with those of SiO masers.',\n"," 'Water deuteration and abundance on a Solar System scale in the Class I source SVS13-A. Water is a crucial molecule in Solar-like star forming regions: it is among the most abundant species in the hot corino regions (where the water-rich ices sublimate as the temperature exceeds ~100 K) and its abundance govern the chemical composition of this regions. Based on the HDO/ H2O ratio, it is argued that terrestrial water was acquired from asteroids and comets whose ices were (at least partially) formed in the protostellar phase of the Solar Nebula. However, few measurements at a Solar System scale exist so far and only for Class 0 sources, so that we have no clue how water abundance and its deuteration evolve in Solar-like protostars. We aim to measure the water abundance and its deuteration in a Class I source, in the region where asteroids and comets form (a radius of ~20au). To reach this goal, we propose to obtain <0.\"2 angular resolution observations towards the only Class I source where previous single-dish observations have detected the presence of warm (150 K) deuterated water on a model-estimated size of ~50 au (Codella et al. 2016a): SVS13-A. This will allow us to strongly constrain whether the water deuteration evolves from Class 0 to Class I sources.',\n"," 'Circumplanetary Disk Masses, Sizes, and Evolution: From Case Studies to Population Statistics. Studying the accretion disks around planetary-mass companions (PMCs; M~10-30 Jupiter masses, orbits typically >100 AU) provides unique insights into the timescale of giant planet assembly and the initial conditions of exomoon formation. To date, the disks around PDS 70 c and SR 12 c are the only two circumplanetary disks detected by ALMA, indicating that deep imaging is necessary to probe disks in the planetary regime. We propose to observe 3 actively accreting PMCs in Band 7, with 3-5x greater sensitivity than previous ALMA non-detections. Multi-wavelength evidence indicates that our targets harbor disks rich in dust and gas, representing the best samples for deep ALMA imaging. We aim to increase the current census of circimplanetary disks from 2 (PDS 70 c and SR 12 c) to 5, compare disk sizes and masses with theoretical expectations, and test whether they follow the traditional scaling relationship from the stellar into the planetary regime. These deep observations may also detect CO(3-2) if PMC disks are relatively extended in gas emission. Even in the unlikely case of non-detections, we will still place stringent limits on the disk properties.',\n"," 'The interstellar medium of Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies at z = 3.1-3.6. This proposal aims to study the molecular and atomic gas properties of hot, dust-obscured galaixes (Hot DOGs). These extreme luminous galaxies, which were discovered with the WISE satellite, are rare class source characterised by a dominant hot dust component from a central obscured AGN. Analysis of the far-infrared spectral energy distribution shows the presence of a luminous cold dust component, possibly associated with starburst activity. It has been proposed that the Hot DOGs represent a short-duration transition phase from starburst- to AGN-dominated stages in the evolution of massive galaxies. We have successfully obtained CO(4-3) detections of three Hot DOGs at redshift z>3. Our results reveal massive molecular gas reservoirs of 10^10-10^11 Msun, which is similar to SMGs. More importantly, we find that all three sources show multi-component systems at <3 kpc scale. This is indicative of on-going or recent merger activity. The proposed observations of CO(7-6), CO(9-8), [CI] and [CII] will provide unique insights to the conditions in the host- and companion galaxies.',\n"," 'A kpc-scale view to the dust and gas content of typical star forming ALPINE galaxies at z~4.6. This proposal is designed to get a detailed view (up to kpc-scales) to the gas and dust content of three carefully selected normal (>0.6L*) galaxies at z~4.6. The galaxies are extracted from the ALPINE survey and they have been already detected at high signal to noise in [CII] and ~160um continuum. The galaxies are massive although follow the so-called \"main sequence\" for star forming galaxies at z~4.6. These sensitive and high resolution observations will facilitate an initial exploration of the interplay between the star-formation activity and the dynamical state on those galaxies which are part of the bulk of the galaxy population. Our main goals are: (1) to reveal the radial profiles of the gas-to-dust ratio and put them in context with galactic evolution models, (2) the exploration for the validity of the Schmidt-Kennicutt law in these \"normal\" z~4.6 galaxies, (3) use high-resolution data to prove their dynamical disk-like or merger nature, (4) explore the role that dark matter halos have in building the baryonic matter in the early Universe, and (5) identify massive clumps of star-formation and their level of stability on rotating disks.',\n"," 'How quiescent are quiescent galaxies?. How many quiescent galaxies that are selected using optical and infrared color-color cuts are dusty galaxies? To answer this question deep far-infrared/submillimeter observations are needed to unambiguously determine the dusty star formation in and around ``quiescent galaxies. Here we propose a pilot study to obtain deep ALMA band 7 observations of a carefully selected, well-defined sample of quiescent galaxies at z=2.5-3.0 in the COSMOS field. We aim to unambiguously determine the obscured star-formation rate of our target sample to a detection limit that ensures quiescence, even if they are not detected. With our proposed observations we will: determine the exact fraction of color-selected quiescent galaxies that are in fact dusty star-forming galaxies; redefine the color cuts used to seperate star-forming and quiescent systems; and derive the stellar mass function of truly quiescent galaxies at z=2.5-3.0, where significant discrepancy remains between model predictions and observations.',\n"," 'Hydronium toward PKS1830-211. We propose observations with one tuning in Band 10 to detect the absorption of hydronium (H3O+) and oxidaniumyl (H2O+) in the z=0.89 molecular absorber toward the bright lensed quasar PKS1830-211. These observations will allow us to probe the chemistry of the oxygen hydride ion family, and measure in a robust, self-consistent analysis the molecular hydrogen fraction, the cosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen, and the electron fraction in the disk of a z=0.89 galaxy, i.e., at an epoch close to the cosmic peak of star formation rate density. We will also measure the rotation temperature of H3O+ and test the universality of formation pumping excitation. The molecular absorber toward PKS1830-211 is the only intermediate-to-high redshift object for which such a detailed chemical analysis can be done, providing a benchmark for distant star-forming galaxies.',\n"," 'Impact of a global dust storm on Martian atmosphere (retry). The most striking phenomenon on Mars is a planet-encircling storm, so-called \"global dust storm\". Once it starts, floating dust covers the whole atmosphere for more than one month, and heats up the global atmosphere via absorption of solar radiation. Our simulations predict that atmospheric temperature rises more than 20 K at 10-60 km altitude over the planet under such global dust storms and the heating also accelerates the dynamics. Moreover, theoretical studies predict the amount of CO could increase due to triboelectric field under a global dust storm. The goal of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate how much change is induced in thermal structure, dynamics, and CO due to a global dust storm. We propose a ToO observation of 12CO and 13CO lines in Band-6 during and after a global dust storm event. Through conscious monitoring of dust opacity by Mars Express spacecraft, we can trigger to carry out the observation in real-time. In addition, this is a unique opportunity to perform joint observations with ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. This new sensitive observation of dust-covered Martian atmosphere with ALMA will provide essential understanding in the meteorology and climate.',\n"," 'Highest Dynamic Range Spatiokinematic Mapping of an Infrared Dark Cloud. Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are the likely precursors of most star formation in our Galaxy and are thus crucial objects to characterize and understand. In particular, the relative importance of turbulence, magnetic fields and internal/external feedback remain poorly known. Here we propose ALMA 3mm observations of 13CO and C18O of a large ~10 field that will be combined with GBT-Argus data to yield the highest ever spatial dynamic range (~8 pc to 0.007 pc) ppv-cube of an IRDC (G38.95-00.47) to probe its molecular gas structure and kinematics. Kinematic methods of inferring B-field properties will be tested, including via comparison with ancillary SOFIA-HAWC+ polarimetric imaging data. We will also observe 12CO emission to trace protostellar outflows and study their influence on driving turbulence in the IRDC. Dedicated numerical simulations of molecular clouds will be developed and tested against the derived datasets, which will also be released to the community for general benchmarking of molecular cloud and star formation physics.',\n"," 'The most intrisically luminous starbursts in the Universe: witnessing the birth of the red sequence. Using all the ALMA-accessible SPIRE imaging, we have defined a sample that is both faint (ergo mostly unlensed) and extremely red (ergo very distant). We further refined this sample via SCUBA-2/LABOCA imaging, choosing only those where z_phot>4. We then demonstrated the remarkable accuracy of our refined z_phot estimates via spectral scans, and discriminated cleanly between lensed galaxies (typically <1\" Einstein rings, interesting in themselves) and intrisically luminous starbursts via our very efficient high-res band-7 continuum snapshots, discovering extraordinary examples of both. Our goals here are: 1) to identify and more than double the number of the most intrisically luminous starbursts in the z>4 Universe, galaxies that are missed by SCUBA-2 surveys due to area and by SPT due to sensitivity. We thereby pinpoint the most massive dark matter halos at these early epochs, in which we find the precursors of galaxies on the red sequence; 2) to directly characterise the physical scale and morphology of their dusty star-forming gas; 3) to robustly challenge popular models of galaxy formation via their morphologies and by determining a considerably more accurate source density.',\n"," 'High Resolution Observations of the Molecular Gas in AGN Hosted by Major Galaxy Mergers. We propose high resolution (0.05\", ~50pc) CO(2-1) observations tracing the molecular gas in the nuclear regions of 4 nearby major galaxy mergers hosting single/dual AGN. These systems trace a range in nuclear separations, and hence merger evolutionary stage, from 0.2 to 4 kpc and represent a >10x improvement in spatial resolution over existing CO data, allowing to resolve the structure of the molecular gas inside the sphere of influence of each supermassive black hole (SMBH) and study individual giant molecular clouds in the circumnuclear medium. Our main scientific goals are: (i) trace the molecular gas dynamics in regions well inside the SMBHs sphere of influence, (ii) study nuclear molecular outflows driven by the SMBH growth, and (iii) measure the amount of gas and kinematics of the gas reservoir for each SMBH in connection to current and future SMBH growth. By sampling both single and dual AGN in similar merger stages, we will study possible structural differences in the gas fueling SMBHs, explaining their contrasting accretion rates. In future cycles more systems will be studied, to draw statistical conclusions once more ALMA high resolution time is available.',\n"," 'Observing Jets and Outflows in Tidal Disruption Events with ALMA. Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) through the tidal disruption of a stray star offers a unique opportunity to study the birth and evolution of relativistic jets and to probe the environment around previously dormant SMBHs on sub-parsec scales. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have long been predicted to produce optical/UV/soft X-ray transient emission from the newly-formed accretion disk, but in the past few years we have shown that some TDEs can also launch relativistic jets and broad outflows, which generate synchrotron emission that peaks in the mm on timescales of days to weeks. To address the open question of jet and outflow formation requires: (i) a larger sample of TDEs from a diverse range of selection methods, and (ii) deep mm follow-up, only possible with ALMA. Here, we propose to observe up to 4 new TDE candidates with triggers from gamma-ray, X-ray, or optical surveys (Swift, Fermi, XMM-Newton Slew Survey, Pan-STARRS, CRTS, DES, ASAS-SN, ZTF). Our mm observations will be sensitive to both non-relativistic outflows and relativistic jets and will constrain jet formation models and rate predictions, which are currently highly uncertain.',\n"," 'ALMA Follow-Up of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers from LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3.

The GW data can shed light on the nature of compact object mergers, providing sensitive tests of General Relativity and insight into the neutron star equation of state. However, these goals can only be achieved via the joint detection of EM counterparts, which provide the necessary astrophysical context. Here we propose ALMA observations of up to three new GW events containing a neutron star during LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3 (Dec 2018-Dec 2019). We will trigger ALMA immediately following the identification of an EM counterpart to search for and characterize relativistic outflows. ALMA observations are critical for breaking model degeneracies inherent to X-ray/cm data, and will delineate the early stages of the outflow when the emission is self-absorbed at cm wavelengths. These observations will pave the way for characterizations of non-thermal emission from GW sources, providing the first ever millimeter detections of GW counterparts.',\n"," 'Gravity vs B-field in massive-star forming clouds: Who is in the driving seat?. The details of what physical processes (between turbulence, gravity, or magnetic field) regulates the mass transfer from the large scales of clouds and filaments onto the small scales of clumps and cores is still highly debated. The origin of such a debate resides in our (past) inability to track the magnetic (B) field properties over such a large range of scales and densities that are involved in the star formation process. Here, we propose to use ALMA to map, on a few thousand AU scale, the B-field morphology and gas velocity field towards the massive-star forming infrared dark cloud G34. Combined with our large-scale study of the region, these new observations will provide, for the first time, a complete picture of energy balance in a massive-star forming cloud.',\n"," 'Measuring vertical settling and radial drift of dust: A survey of young edge-on disks. We propose to observe a well-defined sample of Edge-On Disks to study the radial and vertical distribution of the dust. Scattered light images of edge-on disks like HH 30 have established what we think is typical for the shape and flaring of protoplanetary disks. However, these conclusions are correct only for the small grains, i.e. the near-IR scattering opacity carriers, but are very likely incorrect for the larger dust particles emitting at longer wavelengths. The large particles are expected to be distributed differently in particular because of dust settling, but so far we are still missing direct images that would reveal the vertical stratification of dust of all sizes in T Tauri disks. ALMA cycle-4 offers the perfect opportunity (resolution, sensitivity), and the edge-on geometry allows for direct conclusions beyond doubt. By comparing the gas distribution to the distributions of small and large dust grains, we can draw definite conclusions about the disk shape, and the settling and radial migration of solids with unprecedented details. All are key issues for a better understanding of the physical and chemical processes during the early stages of planet formation.',\n"," 'A Direct Test of the Possible Connection Between Fast Radio Bursts and Superluminous Supernovae. The first precise localization of a fast radio burst (FRB121102) led to two unexpected results: (i) a low metallicity dwarf host galaxy, and (ii) a spatially coincident quiescent radio counterpart. The host galaxy is identical to the hosts of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), a rare type of core-collapse SNe powered by magnetars, while the quiescent radio source is a nebula associated with the FRB. In a recent paper we argued that these results indicate that FRB121102 is powered by a millisecond magnetar born in a SLSN explosion ~30 years ago. A strong prediction of this model is that known SLSNe that are a few years old should also exhibit nebulae, but with a peak in the mm-band. Here we propose to carry out the first such search, targeting a complete sample of all SLSNe (18 sources) that are >1.5 years old, located at z<0.5, and are visible to ALMA; these cuts lead to an expected flux density of >0.1 mJy at 100 GHz. Detections of associated nebulae will have profound implications for our understanding of both FRBs and SLSNe, while non-detections will invalidate our proposed model. We will couple the ALMA results to our modeling of the optical/UV data of the SLSNe.',\n"," 'Evolution of ISM Masses in the First 2 Gyr at z = 3 - 6. We propose to extend our very successful ALMA survey of the ISM contents of galaxies out to the epoch of reionization and initial galaxy formation at z = 3 to 6. In this epoch, the ISM masses generally dominate over stellar masses, thus determining early galaxy formation and evolution. Our observations will probe the ISM masses using the long wavelength Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) dust continuum emission with ALMA continuum observations tailored to maintain lambda_rest > 300 microns and detections at 5-10 sigma based on the expected fluxes of each galaxy. Two samples at z = 3 - 6 that cover a range of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs will be observed: 21 main sequence galaxies from the ALMA Cycle 5 large project ALPINE, and a sample of 7 starburst galaxies having existing Herschel far infrared detections. All galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts and infrared SFRs (from ALPINE 150 mic continuum detection or from Herschel). Dynamical mass estimates are available from the ALPINE [CII] line imaging, providing a powerful calibration of the mass estimates; ALPINE provides the largest galaxy sample with [CII] detected galaxies at z > 4 to date.',\n"," 'Confimation of Blindly Detected [CII]158um emitter candidates at z = 6.0 and 6.5. In order to obtain the first conclusive evidence of blind detections of millimeter emission line sources, we propose follow-up observations of blindly detected two [CII]158um emitter candidates at z=6.0 and 6.5 in ALMA Deep Field in SSA22. In the previous observation, the candidates show S/N ratios of 6.5 and 6.2 sigma. They are faint in far-infrared, optical to near-infrared wavebands. For confirmation of the blind detections and determination of their redshifts, our proposal here is observation targeting the detected [CII] line emissions at band 6 and CO(6-5) emission lines at band 3 with the setting of 0\".7 angular resolution to maximize sensitivity. The total observing time is 15.3 hours. Our proposing science goals are: (1) Confirmation of discovery of new galaxy population which are faint in both of optical/far-infrared continuum (2) Revealing gaseous properties of the new galaxy population at z ~ 6 (3) Estimation of star-formation rates and molecular gas masses of high-redshift normal [CII] emitters (4) Cosmic star-formation rate density and, at the first time, molecular gas mass density at z = 6.2.',\n"," 'Dust growth in protoplanetary disks: where in the disk are grains growing?. The first step toward planet formation is the growth of submicron grains into centimeter-sized particles inside a circumstellar disk. The long-wavelength emission from large dust is the last observable link in the growth chain from interstellar dust grains to fully fledged planets. Thus, observations of this phase provide crucial constraints to theories of early planetesimal growth and of the transport and evolution of dust particles. In this proposal we request ALMA observations at 1.3 mm, that when combined with our existing 0.7 - 1 cm spatially resolved observations, will determine where in the disk are dust grains preferentially growing. With careful characterization of the disk thermal and density structure we can determine the dust optical depth and constrain the dust emissivity index throughout the disk. These ALMA observations will establish if spatial variations of grain growth occur in nature, as it is expected from several theoretical scenarios, like particle trapping at pressure maxima arising from vortices, turbulence, or Rossby-wave instabilities.',\n"," 'Quantifying the molecular gas reservoirs of post-starburst AGN hosts. ALMA observations of a single recently-quenched AGN host at z~0.6 revealed dramatic and unexpected CO(2-1) emission despite suppressed star formation: >10^10.5Msun of molecular gas stretches tens of kpc out from the galaxys center. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is often invoked to shut down star formation-- with this unique galaxy, ALMA may have caught AGN in the act. However, this single object is insufficient to build a statistical link between AGN activity, molecular outflows, and quenching. Here we propose observations of six additional post-starburst AGN hosts from the same parent sample. These galaxies are ideal ALMA targets: they have existing optical spectroscopy and deep high-resolution imaging, and we expect to detect gas given their young stellar ages. We will quantify the fraction of post-starburst AGN hosts that have molecular gas on extended spatial scales, then test whether the gas properties correlate with AGN luminosity, time since quenching, or the location of optical tidal features. This analysis will help pin down the role of AGN in quenching.',\n"," 'Resolving Structure in the Planet Forming Regions of the Compact Binary Protostar GV Tau. GV Tau is a young binary system whose central protostars are each surrounded by a protoplanetary disk which has been estimated to be unusually massive and compact. If the mass estimates are correct, GV Tau N & S may be the first disks known to have sufficient material within their planet forming regions to form giant planets. Their estimated >0.01 solar masses within 30 AU make them potentially true Minimum Mass Solar Nebula equivalents. Furthermore, there is some evidence that dust grain growth and planet formation may already be significantly advanced in these disks. We propose to use ALMA to, for the first time, resolve the compact protoplanetary disks around the GV Tau protostars and determine their structures and masses. We will also use multi-wavelength ALMA observations to constrain dust opacity and particle sizes within the disks, and spatially and spectrally resolve Keplerian rotation in the disks and measure dynamical masses of the protostars. This project will be an interesting case study of a young binary system whose protoplanetary disks may represent the first known analogs of our own primordial Solar System.',\n"," 'The molecular ISM and dust emission of extremely red quasars at high spatial resolution.. Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes is now a standard ingredient in galaxy formation models. It may be necessary to recreate the steep high-mass end of the stellar mass function and establish the black-hole/bulge correlations. We request ALMA observations to map the distribution and kinematics of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation activity in near-Eddington red quasars at z~2.5 with extreme (>> 1000 km/s) outflow activity well beyond that seen at any redshift among any quasar sample. We will observe the CO (7-6) and [CI] 2-1 emission lines and the rest-frame 375 micron dust continuum at 1-2 kpc resolution. We will search for and measure the energetics of the molecular outflows and map their location relative to the ongoing star formation activity. The selected targets will be observed with JWST NIRSpec IFU to map galactic scale ionized gas kinematics and dynamics. ALMA and NIRSpec observations will allow us to measure the location of the fast-moving (>> 1000 km/s) ionized outflows relative to the molecular ISM and star formation activity to gauge the impact of the powerful outflows on star formation activity and the molecular gas reservoir.',\n"," 'Extreme scattering due to cometary globules. Intra-day variability (IDV) and extreme scattering events (ESEs) occur when galactic screens of ionized gas intervene between Earth and a distant point-like radio emitter, causing refractive scattering. We have recently discovered that these phenomena occur in very close proximity to local, hot stars, and that the scattering plasma is found in radial filaments. We expect that these filaments are primarily made up of cold gas with a thin skin of plasma, allowing these scattering screens to be long-lived. These proposed observations aim to observe CO emission from this cold gas surrounding the nearby star Spica, towards a quasar currently displaying large, rapid amplitude modulation. A detection here will greatly improve our understanding of star formation and galaxy dynamics, as these molecular clouds may make up a large fraction of galactic dark matter.',\n"," 'CONICS: Cosmic Noon ISM Conditions Survey. The COsmic Noon ISM Conditions Survey (CONICS) is a comprehensive survey of the mass and conditions in the cold interstellar medium (ISM) of 11 star-forming galaxies during the peak of cosmic star formation (z=2-3). Carefully drawn from optically-selected CO(3-2) surveys, these galaxies form the largest representative sample of star-forming galaxies at this epoch and benefit from exquisite multi-wavelength data. With only two tunings, we will efficiently measure the CO(4-3)+[CI](1-0) and CO(7-6)+[CI](2-1) emission and underlying dust continuum in Bands 4 and 6, providing a homogeneous dataset that is sufficient to constrain the latest generation of radiative transfer models of the cold medium. This program will provide fundamental insights into the boundary conditions for star formation during the peak of the cosmic star formation history by measuring (i) the total mass in cold gas and dust (ii) the physical conditions in the cold molecular medium (e.g., temperature, density). Building on years of investments with ALMA and NOEMA, CONICS will provide the most comprehensive survey of the gas masses and ISM conditions in galaxies at cosmic noon to date.',\n"," 'Unveiling a Massive Node of the Cosmic Web at z=3. Galaxies form and evolve within the diffuse filaments of the Cosmic Web. Direct imaging of these filaments has for long remained elusive leaving many questions open: How do galaxies get their gas? What is the morphology and kinematics of accreting gas and how does this affect the gas content and star formation activity of galaxies? A recent MUSE survey around a z=3 quasar has finally provided one of the first images of contiguous cosmic filaments on Mpc-scales converging into a node containing a large galaxy concentration and the only known close-separation triple AGN at high-z. Because highly-star-forming galaxies are typically dust-obscured, the MUSE data gives a partial view of the galaxy distribution within and around filaments. To overcome this limitation we propose ALMA dust-continuum and CO mosaic observations in order to: i) obtain a complete census of highly-star-forming and dust-obscured galaxies in the field, ii) measure and correlate the gas content of galaxies with the density and kinematics of filaments in order to understand how galaxies get their gas, iii) reveal the morphological and kinematical properties of the gas component of galaxies within the Cosmic Web node',\n"," 'The Warm/Dense Circumnuclear Disk and Black Hole Mass of Centaurus A. In powerful radio-galaxies the properties of the circumnuclear gas from hundred parsecs down to the accretion disk are hitherto poorly understood. Cen~A is by far the closest giant elliptical and powerful radio galaxy, and is the key to understanding molecular gas properties and the feeding mechanisms in the entire class of powerful radio galaxies. Although it is known that gas with a wide range of temperatures and densities are found to co-exist in the r < 200 pc circumnuclear gas of Cen~A, we still do not have high resolution information of the warm and dense gas. We aim to probe such material via CO(3-2), CO(6-5) with 5 pc resolution, as well as HCO+ and HCN(1-0) with 10 pc resolution, in a mosaic encompassing the inner circumnuclear disk (r<200pc). We will study 1) the distribution and kinematics of such warm and dense molecular gas, especially in an inner gap at r < 80 pc found in our lower resolution CO(2-1) data, 2) probe the physical mechanisms feeding the active galactic nuclei, and 3) obtain a measure of the mass of the supermassive black hole.',\n"," 'A Pilot Study of Warm Molecular Gas in High-redshift Obscured Quasars. We request ACA observations of the CO(J=7-6) transition in a small sample of 5 high-redshift (z>~3), hyper-luminous (Lbol > 10^14 Lsun), dust-obscured quasars for which at least two other lower-J CO line transitions have already been detected with ALMA and VLA. This is a pilot program motivated by the surprisingly bright detection of the CO(J=12-11) transition in the most luminous obscured quasar known, W2246-0526, which suggests that it is possible to detect mid-J CO transitions in these extreme objects using the ACA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) to start investigating the excitation properties of the warm molecular gas in high-z obscured quasars and place them in context with other dusty galaxy populations, and (2) to determine whether the CO(J=7-6) line, which has recently been proposed as a good star formation rate indicator, can be truly used in galaxies with such extreme environments. This will be the first time that such a study is conducted in this new population of high-z quasars.',\n"," 'Witnessing grain growth across the CO snowline in HD163296. To grow and form planetesimals and, eventually, rocky cores of planets, dust grains in protoplanetary disks need to overcome several barriers. One intriguing theoretical idea is that sublimation fronts of the major volatiles in disks may promote a localised growth process. ALMA has started to resolve the CO snowline (one of the major snowlines in disks) in nearby disks and for the first time offers the possibility to directly test this theoretical scenario. Reanalizing the ALMA Band 7 Science Verification data we have recently discovere an excess continuum emission at the location of the CO snowline in the protoplanetary disk surrounding HD163296. We thus propose to obtain high sensitivity, 0.3arcsec resolution images of the disk at 90GHz and derive directly a measurement of the spectral index of the emission across the snowline. Our experiment is designed to conclusively prove whether grain growth is promoted at the location of the CO snowline and thus provide a critical test for the theoretical models of grain evolution in diesks on the path of forming planetary systems.',\n"," 'Confirming a massive proto-cluster of submm galaxies at z ~ 6 discovered by ALMA. While following up with ALMA a FIR-colour-selected sample of z > 4 SMGs, we have discovered an extreme cluster of SMGs at high redshift. Our previous 3--mm continuum data from ALMA show that the structure contains at least 6 submm sources within 30. Four of the sources show emission at 98.4 GHz, which suggests that most (and possibly all) of the SMGs are actually at the same redshift, belonging to a unique, massive, star-bursting structure. The profile of the emission line in the brightest component is extremely broad (1040 km/s FWHM for a Gaussian fit, though the line profile is boxy). The most likely redshift, based on ALMA, JVLA, optical/ near-IR data and FIR SED is z = 6.0. Our best estimate of the total IR luminosity of the structure is an incredible LIR ~ 6E13 Lsun, or SFR ~ 10800 Msun/yr. This SFR is three times higher than that of the most intense dusty starburst found so far. Confirming that such an extreme star-bursting system has formed only a few hundreds of Myr after the Big Bang is of profound and urgent interest, since it poses a genuine problem for accepted models of galaxy and structure formation.',\n"," 'Constraining the agents of change - the impact of clumpy winds on massive stellar evolution. There is considerable evidence for structure (clumping) in the radiatively driven stellar winds of hot stars. The existence of clumping has important consequences for mass-loss rate determinations. Mass-loss rates that are not corrected for clumping provide incorrect inputs for stellar and galactic evolution models. ALMA observations are ideally suited to study the effect of clumping in the critical (intermediate) regions of the wind. We propose to measure the 3 mm continuum fluxes of a sample of OB stars in the strategically important massive stellar cluster Westerlund 1, for which we already have optical, near-IR and radio measurements. The ALMA observations will substantially increase the observational material, allowing us to uniquely constrain clumping gradients and thus advance our understanding of wind clumping and its relation to stellar and wind parameters. The quantitative information derived in this project will ultimately allow is to correct massive star mass-loss rates for clumping and put considerable constraints on the theoretical models, which is vital to our understanding of the hydrodynamics of these winds.',\n"," 'Origin of the Hub-Filament System G33.92+0.11. Protostellar clusters are often found at the center of Hub-Filament Systems (HFSs), prompting the possibility that filaments play a cruel role in transporting material to the hub to provide the fuel needed for cluster formation. We propose to measure the dust continuum polarization and the C18O (2-1) line toward a HFS G33.92+0.11 with ACA using band 6. Wang et al. (2020) performed systematic statistics on the interplay between the orientation of filaments, gravity, B-field, and velocity gradient, and found that G33.92+0.11 is indeed dominated by the converging accretion flows powered by the global gravity. However, their JCMT observations lack the resolution to resolve the B-field within filaments with a width of ~15 arcsec, and thus unable to detect the expected transition of the B-field morphology from the outside to the inside of the filaments. The proposed ACA observations with a resolution of 5.5\" will resolve the filaments by ~3 independent beams, and hence offer a crucial test to the suggested scenario.',\n"," 'A search for extragalactic argonium, ArH+, a probe of the very atomic diffuse interstellar medium. The J = 1 - 0 transitions of 36ArH+ and 38ArH+ near 617.5 and 616.6 GHz were detected in absorption toward the Galactic Center source Sgr B2 with the Herschel Space Observatory. The former was also seen toward several prominent galactic continuum sources. Model calculations suggest that the cation samples in these observations exclusively the very atomic, diffuse ISM with a molecular fraction of about 10-3 or less. We propose to search for ArH+ toward PKS 1830-211 and B 0218+357 at z = 0.89 and 0.68, respectively, in order to gain more insight into the role of this cation as a probe of the very atomic, diffuse ISM and to determine 36Ar/38Ar ratios in the earlier Universe.',\n"," 'Quest for the source: connecting a filament to infalling gas towards a protostar in Barnard 5. The classical picture of star formation involves the gravitational collapse of a dense core, but without any connection to its environment (the larger molecular cloud). Streamers of infalling material from the envelope towards disks around young stellar objects have been detected in all stages of the star formation process (Class 0 to Class II), which suggest that the local environment plays a crucial role on star- and disk-formation up to later stages than previously thought. However, the full extent and their contribution to the protostars mass budget is lacking. This stops us from carrying out a thorough assessment of how relevant streamers are to the star-formation process. Our goal is to investigate the origin of the streamer found towards B5IRS1, a Class I protostar in Barnard 5. We propose a mosaic observation at intermediate scales (1-1.5\" beam), between the filament (5\" beam) and the high-resolution streamer observations (0.4\" beam) that already exist, to follow the gas motions using the same molecule at all scales. This is the first attempt to connect infalling gas to the filament where a protostar is embedded. For this purpose, we request 4.8h of the 12m array.',\n"," 'Testing structure formation, quenching and gas accretion models with a sample of 36 groups/clusters at 2<z<3.5. We propose to spectroscopically confirm a homogeneous sample of 36 Herschel/SPIRE-selected starbursting massive galaxy cluster/group candidates at z=2-3.5 via ALMA redshift scans for CO[5-4] in band4/5. Targets are selected as SPIRE-350um peakers associated with prominent overdensities of massive high-redshift galaxies, and are from 3 widely separated fields covering 20 sq.deg. Pilot projects already demonstrated the efficiency of our approach: all 3 already-observed targets in COSMOS proved to be genuine groups/clusters at z=2.5-3.3. This ALMA program will observe 33 additional targets, increasing the confirmed number of structures by one order of magnitude, to enable first statistical constraints on the number density of forming galaxy groups/clusters at cosmic noon, and to open a new window on structure-formation at the peak epoch of cosmic assembly. The goals of this ambitious ALMA project will include measuring, as a function of dark matter halo mass and redshift, the distributions of total masses, SF rates and efficiencies, gas content, addressing key outstanding open questions on massive galaxies and structure formation and critically testing model predictions.',\n"," 'CI and high-J CO emission from jet-impacted clouds in IC5063: cosmic ray vs. shock heating and their impact on X_CO. Shocks and cosmic rays (CRs) are dominant pathways of feedback-ISM coupling in jet-driven outflows, that differently affect the molecular gas. Shocks drive hotter, thinner molecular outflows than CRs, requiring lower X_CO factors to provide the outflow mass. To overcome this uncertainty, which can be as high as 1 order of magnitude, we will determine X_CO in the galaxy IC5063 - a prototype for jet-driven outflows - by means of SLED fitting. We request CO(6-5), (7-6), CI(2-1), and HCO+(8-7) data that, combined with previous low-J CO and HCO+ data, will enable us to model the line emission via astrochemical, thermally-balanced radiative transfer calculations using CRs and shocks as heating sources. Once the shock- vs. CR- excited fraction of the clouds is known and X_CO is determined, the molecular mass content of the flow will be found. We will compare molecular and atomic (CI-based) masses to evaluate in which phase does most of the gas get accelerated. With our calculations also providing the cloud density and temperature, we will study how pressure changes associated with the jet passage lead to the evaporation of molecular clouds and to the flow mass loading.',\n"," '3D tomography in protoplanetary disks with spiral density waves. Spiral arms have been observed in ten protoplanetary disks in near-infrared scattered light and now also in the sub-millimetre. They were interpreted as signatures of the interaction between the disk and a planetary or stellar companion, even though such companion have been detected in only one system, HD100453 the target of this proposal. We thus propose to observe the young spiral-bearing disk around HD100453 with ALMA to detect the sub-millimetre counterpart of the spirals seen in scattered light. Since the pitch angle of spiral waves depends on the temperature via the sound speed, the comparison of the spiral pitch angle in ALMA continuum and in SPHERE scattered light images can provide us a new method of studying the vertical thermal stratification in the disk. While the pitch angle vary with height above the disk mid-plane, spirals at all layers converge towards the perturber exciting them. Thus the comparison of SPHERE and ALMA observations of spirals can also provide us information on the location of the perturber, which we wish to study in HD100453. Such technique would be an immense help in the search for the perturber in other systems where the perturber is unknown.',\n"," 'Identifying the Brightest Continuum Sources Accessible to ALMA with the ACA. Molecular gas plays a vital role in the evolution of massive galaxies and their clusters, but the standard approach of detecting it through emission lacks sensitivity. Observing molecular absorption lines can overcome this limitation, allowing for studies on smaller scales and providing insights into the properties of low mass cold gas clouds. So far, nine galaxies have been identified with molecular absorption, revealing information about cloud sizes, velocities, and masses. However, the current sample size is limited, and more absorption lines are needed for a statistically significant understanding. The main challenge lies in the requirement for galaxies to have bright continuum sources, which limits the available targets. To address this, we propose conducting ACA observations of the brightest sources known at frequencies below 10 GHz, where no higher frequency data is available. These observations will identify the brightest targets at the higher frequencies of molecular lines, facilitating future ALMA observations for detecting molecular absorption lines and expanding our understanding of massive galaxies molecular clouds',\n"," 'Wave Heating in Solar Prominences. The mechanism responsible for heating the solar corona is one of the most fundamental problems in solar physics and astrophysics in general. Recent observations by the Hinode and IRIS satellites have revealed that the solar atmosphere is filled with small-scale oscillations caused by waves that can carry sufficient energy to heat the corona. However, it is unclear whether waves actually contribute to coronal heating, because of the difficulty in measuring the temperatures of chromospheric features in the corona. ALMA is the first instrument that can directly measure the temperature of the highly-resolved chromosphere. We propose observations of prominences above the solar limb for several hours jointly with ALMA and IRIS. By comparing a temperature map by ALMA with the spatial distribution of waves along fine structures of prominences observed by IRIS, we can directly investigate the temperature variation associated with the presence of waves. The relationship between temperature changes and wave properties will provide critical information about the mechanism of wave dissipation and thus tightly constrain wave-heating models.',\n"," 'ALMA Observations of the Shocked Gas in the Puppis A Supernova Remnant. Investigating the interaction between the supernova shock waves and surrounding interstellar gas is essential in understanding evolutionary tracks from the neutral molecular clouds to hot plasma, which affect both star formation and evolution of the interstellar medium. We here propose to observe shocked molecular clouds in the supernova remnant Puppis A, which are rim-brightened in the X-ray emitting plasma. Since the plasma parameters (electron density, temperature, and shock elapsed time) have changed dramatically around the shocked molecular clouds, Puppis A is the best target to unveil the mechanism of hot gas production. However, we could not establish the relation between the plasma parameters and neutral cloud distributions due to the modest angular resolution (~23 arcsec), sensitivity, and the sparse observing coverage in the current datasets. The proposed ALMA ACA observations of CO(J = 2-1) at resolutions of 6 arcsec (~0.06 pc at the SNR distance) will allow us to study the relation between the shock-survived molecular clouds and hot plasma at a meaningful spatial scale. ALMA is the only telescope array to fulfill such requirements.',\n"," 'Resolving disks and mergers in the Epoch of Reionization. We propose deep, high angular resolution band 6 observations of [CII]158mum in six star-forming galaxies at z~6.5-7.7. These galaxies were recently spectroscopically confirmed through [CII] (at low angular resolution) and they are among the brightest known [CII] emitters in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), while still representative of `normal star-forming galaxies (log(LIR/Lsol)<12). We will derive the kinematics of these galaxies at a very early stage of galaxy formation and test if these distant systems are forming their stars in well-ordered, gas-rich disks or if they are dominated by turbulent gas motion. This analysis will yield the first measurement of the disk fraction in the EoR and reveal if smooth accretion from the cosmic web or major mergers contribute most to the build-up of stellar and baryonic mass 700 million years after the Big Bang. The observations will simultaneously reveal any outflows, if present, and we will investigate the morphology of the gas and dust with respect to the stars that are visible in the rest-frame UV and optical from upcoming Cycle 1 JWST observations.',\n"," 'A Large Unbiased and Complete Survey of CO in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the only laboratory to study the low metallicity ISM at high spatial resolution, and yet we still do not know where the CO emission exists. We propose to use the ACA in standalone mode to map a 1.0 x 0.5 degree (1 kpc x 500 pc) region of the SW Bar of the SMC in 12CO, 13CO, C18O (2-1) covering a large fraction of the recent star formation, dust, and HI gas. With this new map we will be able to catalog CO clouds and clumps down to a mass of ~1000 solar masses and with a factor of ~15x increase in luminosity sensitivity over the existing large-scale single-dish APEX map. With only the ACA and the minimum integration time per pointing, we will produce a map of extragalactic CO with the greatest mass sensitivity and covering ~1.5 pc to 1 kpc scales. Once we have an accurate account of the CO-emitting gas we will be able to measure the CO luminosity function, the dynamical state, how CO brightness relates to environmental properties, and variations in X(CO). Further analysis of the data will allow us to understand the turbulence properties across all scales and how the CO emission relates to the HI gas at low metallicity.',\n"," 'Disk Demographics in Lupus. We propose to survey the gas and dust in 98 protoplanetary disks in the nearby Lupus star forming region. This is a complete sample of all known optically visible stars with large infrared excesses and stellar masses > 0.1 solar. We will observe the 13CO and C18O 3-2 lines and have developed models to derive total gas masses and surface density profiles. The sensitivity of these data is a few Martian masses (0.2-0.4 Earth) in the dust and Saturnian masses (0.1-0.3 Jupiter) in the gas. We will be able to detect the lowest mass disks in both the continuum and line for a gas-to-dust ratio similar to the ISM. We will observe to about 20 AU linear resolution, sufficient to measure sizes and surface density profiles in all but the smallest disks. At these scales we also expect to see features such as inner holes and azimuthal asymmetries that may signpost planet formation. The sample size, sensitivity, and resolution of this survey will provide much needed demographics for disk studies and planetary synthesis models. To maximize its impact, we will reduce the proprietary period to 3 months and make the data products available through a dedicated disk archive within 1 year.',\n"," 'Cycle 7 Monitoring of the Sub-mm Brightness in the Inner Envelopes of Known Variable Deeply Embedded Protostars. We propose to use the standalone mode of the ACA to obtain band 7 continuum observations for 4 epochs over cycle 7 of three known variable protostars and 5 stable calibrator sources in the Serpens Main Cloud. This is an extension of our ongoing cycle 6 monitoring of the same sources. The observations will take place contemporaneously with the JCMT Transient Survey, which observes the region at a two to four week cadence. The ACA will monitor the brightness evolution in the inner envelope where the dust responds explicitly to changes in the source accretion luminosity. At the distance to Serpens Main of ~436pc, our ACA observations will resolve scales of ~3.8\"/1600 AU and recover scales as large as ~19.7\"/8200 AU, complementing the JCMTs angular resolution at 850 microns of ~14.6\"/6000AU. Thus, comparison between the JCMT and ACA observations will provide critical information on the structure of the envelope, its variability, and its environment. As well, any stochastic event that occurs during the cycle should manifest itself in the ACA observations weeks to months earlier than in the JCMT observations, providing an unambiguous probe of the dust response rate through the envelope.',\n"," 'The kpc-scale Dust Temperature, Star Formation and ISM at z=7.3. REBELS-25 - the brightest known star-forming galaxy in the epoch of reionization - provides a truly unique laboratory of the early build-up of massive galaxies. Recent Cycle 8 ALMA observations have carefully mapped the spatially resolved dust continuum and [CII] emission in this z=7.306 starburst, revealing clumpy star formation, potential spiral structure and clear rotation in a galaxy only 700 Myr after the Big Bang. Through combined unresolved Band 4 and 9 observations and ~0.2\" (~1 kpc) Band 8 observations, we aim to 1) simultaneously constrain the global dust temperature and emissivity in the galaxy; 2) construct spatially resolved maps of the dust temperature, infrared luminosity and obscured star formation, and; 3) utilize the [OIII] 88um line to reveal its resolved multi-phase ISM. These timely observations will provide insight into an array of key topics in early galaxy evolution, such as the spatial distribution of (hot) dust, the origin and nature of the high-redshift Schmidt-Kennicutt relation and the physical processes governing the escape of the ionizing photons driving reionization.',\n"," 'Arp 220 Nuclear Disks at 0.027-0.05 Resolution. We propose to complete our ultra-high resolution imaging of Arp 220 to resolve the gas structures and dynamics in the two nuclear disks. In ALMA Cycle 3, our project 2015.1.00113.S was scheduled for both long and short baseline imaging in the CO (1-0), (2-1) and (3-2) lines. This project was A-ranked but so far we have received only the CO (1-0) imaging. Although this project was carried over to Cycle 4, we do not know if it will be completed in Cycle 4; here we submit the uncompleted parts of the original project. In Cycle 5 which provides longer baselines, we also propose to augment the Cycle 3 CO (1-0) resolution by a factor 2 to 0.05, and to obtain the remaining high resolution imaging in the CO 2-1 which will yield 4x higher resolution (0.027) than the existing CO (1-0). This spectacular imaging will resolve physical radii down to 5 pc within the central gas concentrations and well within the sphere of influence of the putative super massive black hole. In addition, the CO line ratio and excitation analysis in Arp 220 an analog of high z starbursts and SMGs will provide a vital foundation for interpreting observations of high z mergers.',\n"," 'High-precision polarization study of the fast variability at the base of an AGN jet. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) produce powerful jets of relativistic plasma emitting non-thermal synchrotron radiation. Recently, we have reported the first ALMA measurement of Faraday rotation at submm wavelengths from the jet base of the lensed quasar PKS1830-211. For that, we analysed dual polarization data with a differential polarization technique in which, basically, the relative difference in polarization state of the two lensed images was measured. We now propose full-polarization ALMA observations of the same object at Band 6. We will probe variability of the polarization angle on timescales of few minutes to a couple of hours, allowing us to discriminate the different models of particle-shock interaction in AGN jets, and their role in the submm polarimetry and in the production of high-energy radiation. These full-polarization observations will also allow us to confirm bona fide the validity of our differential polarimetry technique.',\n"," 'Properties of a temperature-unbiased sample of Herschel 250um-selected galaxies at z >2.5. We propose to observe 870 micron dust continuum of 200 Herschel 250micron-selected galaxies at z > 2.5 with ALMA Band 7. Our sample is unique in selecting infrared luminous galaxies in a manner unbiased by dust temperature, contrary to submillimeter-selected samples which prefer colder dust temperatures. The primary beam of ALMA at 870 microns is well matched to the 18 arcsec FWHM of the SPIRE 250 micron beam, making Band 7 observations optimal for resolving counterparts to the Herschel sources. With ALMA, we will (1) identify optical counterparts and resolve the multiplicity of our Herschel 250micron-selected sample in its 18 arcsec beamsize, (2) directly measure dust temperature and mass, and (3) characterize the dust as a function of star formation properties. Our unbiased dust temperature sample includes star-forming galaxies with warmer dust which have not yet been studied with ALMA at these redshifts. The proposed observations will open a new window to improve our view of dusty galaxy evolution in the early universe and test evolutionary connections to other galaxy populations such as local ULIRGs.',\n"," 'Untangling the dynamics and structure of complex star-forming systems: bar-ends of the star-forming disc galaxy NGC3627. Star formation is complex due to a web of opposing physical mechanisms acting for and against the collapse of molecular clouds. One scenario that could influence this is the so-called cloud-cloud collisions. Whilst simulations have shown that cloud collisions initiate star formation, observational studies of such regions in extragalactic sources have thus far been limited due to the high resolution needed to separate interacting clouds (a few pc). The bar ends regions of galaxies are regions of active star formation. Therefore, they are exciting regions to study cloud-cloud collisions due to a significant amount of gas buildup. We propose to observe bar ends located in a nearby star-forming galaxy NGC3627 with ALMA at high angular resolution (0.13arcsec; 7pc). We request 17hr of 12-meter time to observe the bulk molecular gas tracer CO(2-1). With these observations, we will resolve individual molecular structures, which will allow us to study a) search for the signature of cloud-cloud collisions, b) the dynamical effects on the gas flows in bar ends, and c) using complementary HST and JWST observations, linking the molecular gas properties to recent star formation and feedback.',\n"," 'Fragmentation and Disk Formation in Low-metallicity Star Formation. Although massive stars play essential roles through cosmic history, the formation of massive stars is still poorly understood, particularly in the low-metallicity regime like the earlier epoch of the Universe. Massive protostars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are the best targets to investigate massive star formation in the low-metallicity environment. We propose high-resolution observations of seven LMC massive protostars with the resolution of 0.1\", i.e., 5000au. This is the first-ever LMC project to resolve the dynamics smaller than the protostellar-core scale of 0.1pc. We will investigate the characteristics of core fragmentation by the 870um continuum, and study the dynamics of the envelopes (infalling flow and disk rotation) with the hot-core molecular lines (SO, SO2, CH3OH) and the outflows with CO and SiO. By comparing these results with the corresponding Galactic observations, we will examine the universality of massive star formation in different metallicity environments.',\n"," 'Magnetic field and emission mechanism in relativistic jets on sub-pc and kpc scales. We apply for 9 hours of ALMA time in full polarization mode to study the magnetic field structure and emission mechanisms of the nearest quasar 3C273 at both sub-pc and kpc-scales. We will observe the source at 2.1, 1.3, and 0.85mm to obtain total flux density and polarization continuum spectra of the source both in its unresolved core and the kpc-scale hotspot. Our pilot observations in Cycle 4 showed that there is a very large amount of Faraday rotation around the unresolved core of the source. The proposed observations will constrain the magnetoionic environment of the source by allowing us to distinguish between two plausible magnetic field configurations that are responsible for the Faraday rotation. We will also obtain, for the first time, polarization observations of the hotspot in 3C273 in the millimeter wavelengths, in order to study the magnetic field direction in comparison with radio and optical observations. The continuum mm-band spectrum along the kpc-scale jet will be crucial for determining the dominant emission mechanism and particle population, which affect the energetics of relativistic jets and their effect on the surrounding large-scale environment.',\n"," 'A robust black hole mass measurement for a z=6.326 QSO resolving the black hole sphere of influence. A great number of SMBHs in excess of 1e+9 Msun have been found at z>6, and explaining their formation mechanisms has become an enormous challenge. However, there is no direct confirmation that such massive SMBHs really exist in the early universe. We propose high resolution (0.04-0.07 arcsec) Band 6 observations for a luminous QSO at z=6.326, hosting the most massive central BH found to date, whose global kinematics is already constrained well based on previous [CII] observations. We will resolve the sphere of influence of the central BH with previously detected CO(17-16), most of which is likely to be emitted from the circum-nuclear disk. Our immediate objective is to measure the velocity curve based on the resolved CO(17-16) and to obtain a robust measurement of its central BH mass based on the position-velocity diagram (PVD). We will compare the PVD-based BH mass with the previous estimates from the empirical relation using the MgII line width and continuum luminosity (that will be updated with JWST using H-beta). If the BH mass obtained from this program is significantly smaller or even larger, it will have a great impact on our understanding of SMBH formation scenarios.',\n"," 'Physical drivers of the H2/HI ratio in extremely gas-rich, star-forming galaxies. We propose to use ALMA to measure the molecular hydrogen content and kinematics of 5 unusually HI-rich galaxies at z~0.2. These are drawn from the HIGHz survey, which includes not only the highest-redshift detections of HI emission to date, but also some of the most HI massive disk galaxies known in the local Universe, with HI-to-stellar mass ratios up to 190%. Despite having huge HI reservoirs and low stellar surface densities, which might be suggestive of giant, inert disks below the threshold for star formation, HIGHz galaxies are forming stars at higher levels than a typical main-sequence galaxy of the same stellar mass. These systems seem to challenge the pressure model for star formation, but are missing the key information on their molecular gas content. With ALMA we will be able to quantify the partition of hydrogen between its atomic and molecular phases, hence gaining crucial insights into the physics that regulates the star formation in the very gas-rich regime that is thought to be more common in the high-redshift Universe.',\n"," 'CO observations covering the entire N55, the best example of stochastic self-propagating star formation, in Super Giant Shell 4 in the LMC. We propose an ALMA observation of molecular gas toward N55 in the LMC. N55 is located in the Super Giant Shell 4, and is a cometary-shaped cloud that is thought to be affected by supernova explosions. The Spitzer/Herschel images show peculiar features in this region; there are a lot of filaments and clumps entangled with a size scale of a few pc, and then this structure may be formed by an effect of shocks from the supernova explosions. The Spitzer/Herschel data also show that many YSOs are distributed inside N55, indicating that the star formation is on-going. We observed molecular gas in N55 by using ASTE in the J=3-2 lines of 12CO and 13CO with an angular resolution of 23 arcsec. One of the CO peaks with a luminous YSO is a position where infrared filaments seem to be merging, and then there is a possibility that star formation has been by the filament merging. We found that with the ALMA + ACA array we can cover a whole molecular gas distribution of a GMC in Band-3 in the LMC without losing information on extended emission. In the present proposal, we then make mosaic observations of the entire cloud covering as large as 224”x387” area, corresponding to 90pc x 50pc, in the lines of 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0), CS(2-1) and H40alpha by using the ALMA with the ACA array (7m + TP) with a final angular resolution of a few arcsec, corresponding to a spatial resolution of ~0.6 pc. This type of observations can be achieved for the first time during the Cycle 1, and then our knowledge of the GMCs in the external galaxy will be greatly improved. With this observation, we aim to resolve the filamentary structures and clumps with precise velocity information to be compared with the data of Spitzer-SAGE and Herschel-HERITAGE, and with simulations. This study will enable us to derive detailed physical properties of the possibly induced star forming GMC, leading to an understanding of the formation mechanism of highly filamentary structures and eventually of the role of the supernova explosions on the dense core and star formation.',\n"," 'Can C0/CO abundance ratio be a robust discriminator of PDRs and XDRs? -A test study in NGC 7469. To identify energy sources of galaxies at mm/submm (least affected by dust extinction) can be an excellent way to uncover dust-obscured AGNs, which are elusive at optical. Although we have proposed that HCN abundance enhancement with respect to HCO+ can be a potential method, we here propose to test another energy diagnostics using C0 and CO lines to make an independent way to pursue. Indeed, chemical models predict a drastic (orders of magnitude!) enhancement of [CI](1-0)/13CO(2-1) ratio in XDRs than in PDRs, which reflects much higher C0/CO abundance ratio in the former. In this program, we then try to measure (i) [CI](1-0)/13CO(2-1) flux ratio, and (ii) C0/CO abundance ratio via non-LTE modellings (using 12CO J=1-0, 2-1, 3-2, and [CI](1-0) lines), in the central 2 kpc of the type-1 luminous Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469. We will selectively probe its (relatively large) XDR with a proposed 0.3\" resolution. This is the first, robust and spatially resolved measurement of the C0/CO ratio around an AGN. As an additional goal, we also try to estimate a molecular mass conversion factor from [CI](1-0) line, as this is argued to be a good mass tracer applicable to high redshifts.',\n"," 'A comprehensive study of the most massive proto-cluster in the COSMOS field. The early stages of galaxy cluster formation remain poorly constrained observationally, particularly due to the low number of known cluster progenitors (a.k.a galaxy proto-clusters) at high redshifts. We have serendipitously identified an overdensity of six spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the middle of the COSMOS field at z=5.85, roughly 1 Gyr after the Big Bang. An analysis of the COSMOS2020 deep photometric redshift catalog reveals an overdensity potentially far more significant and large around the same redshift. Here we request [CII] observations (and dust continuum for free) on ~25 proto-cluster galaxy candidates to I) spectroscopically confirm the most massive proto-cluster in COSMOS; II) estimate its contribution to the cosmic star-formation; III) study the impact of environment on the star formation activity; and IV) test theoretical predictions on the early stages of galaxy cluster formation. This structure in particular is unique since it has a rich ancillary multi-wavelength data and guaranteed JWST NIRCam/MIRI and ALMA 2mm imaging, plus an excellent control sample representative of the field.',\n"," 'Serpens South: Morphology and kinematics of the protostar at the cluster center. A model for low-mass star formation is generally understood to incorporate a bipolar jet/outflow, envelope, and disk. Until now, the precise mechanisms of momentum transfer, jet launching, infall and envelope rotation -- relating all of these complementary protostellar components -- remained observationally elusive, yet ALMA is now able to probe the full range of spatial scales from outflow to disk. In Cycle 3, we propose Band 7 observations of the envelope and disk kinematics of the young protostellar source in the Serpens South cluster. These observations with spatial resolution of 60 AU, which also allow a study of the jet structure near the source, will complement our ALMA Cycle 1 observations of the collimated and episodic outflow. Together, we suggest that ALMA can provide a comprehensive case study of the inter-related jet/outflow and rotation/infall mechanisms during the class 0 stage of star formation.',\n"," 'Gas Temperature Structure and Mass of the Disk around DM Tau. We propose high spatial resolution ALMA observations of CO emission lines from the transition disk around the source DM Tau. Our aim is to infer the temperature structure of the disk from a multi-line (6-5, 3-2 and 1-0 transitions), multi-isotopic ($^{12}$C$^{16}$O,$^{13}$C$^{16}$O and $^{12}$C$^{18}$O) study which traces gas at different spatial locations and hence physical conditions in the disk. The observational program will be accompanied by detailed thermochemical modeling that includes selective photodissociation of isotopic species to compute the gas temperature. Ancillary HD 1-0 line flux measurements will be used to constrain the gas mass of the disk. Comparisons between models and ALMA data will allow us to determine disk gas temperature structure, which is important in regulating the chemical state of the disk and forms a key input to various disk evolutionary processes such as viscous accretion, photoevaporation and finally planet formation.',\n"," 'What type of stars are the progenitors of water fountain nebulae?. We aim to identify the stellar progenitors of a particular class of post-AGB objects that are characterised by the presence of high-velocity water masers tracing collimated structures. These objects are refered to as water fountain nebulae (wf-nebulae) and their study is important to understand the evolution of intermediate/low mass stars since they are thought to be experiencing their earliest manifestation of asymmetric mass loss. Thus, they have been proposed to be the progenitors of bipolar/multipolar planetary nebulae (PN). Up to date, the fossil circumstellar envelopes (CSE) of wf-nebulae, formed in previous evolutionary phases and holding key information of their mass loss rate history, have not been imaged, nor their physical parameters have been characterised. Consequently, the stellar progenitors of wf-nebulae have not been identified yet. We propose to use ALMA to carry out the first systematic imaging of the molecular emission from the fossil CSE of all known wf-nebulae to characterise their progenitors. From the proposed observations we will obtain physical parameters such as mass loss rate, isotopic ratio, spatial extent, and systemic velocity.',\n"," 'Resolving the gas, dust and stars in a spatially-extended z=2.24 starburst. Star-forming (SF) galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation are observed to have high molecular gas fractions, extreme star formation effiencies, and turbulent conditions that differ substantially form local galaxies. We propose high resolution ALMA CO(J=3-2) observations of an H-alpha-identified SF galaxy at z=2.24, SHiZELS-14. kpc-scale, matched resolution data in H-alpha (from SINFONI/VLT), UV (from HST), FIR continuum (ALMA Band 6) and the radio continuum (VLA 4-8GHz) already exist. Unlike previous targets resolved by ALMA at this redshift, which tend to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with compact dust continuum emission, SHiZELS-14 displays spectacular extended dust emission, with well-resolved, clumpy UV and H-alpha emission. We propose to characterise the galaxys molecular gas content and kinematics at comparable spatial resolution to our existing multi-wavelength data. With CO completing our unique dataset, we will study the efficiency of star formation and the buildup of stellar mass, and constrain alpha_C0, the critical calibration between CO line luminosity and molecular gas mass, all at high redshift and high spatial resolution.',\n"," 'ACA Mapping of the Largest Supergiant HII Region in the Nearby Universe: 30 Doradus. The 30 Doradus region is the most extreme example of a supermassive HII region in the nearby universe, powered by its central R136 super star cluster. Surrounded by a complex of molecular clouds experiencing the disrupting effects of photoionization, winds, and compression by hot gas, only a small region in the very central core has been imaged/approved for imaging with ALMA. We propose to map a 15x15 area encompassing all massive star formation in the area and most of the dusty environments, using the ACA with a high-enough sensitivity to produce high quality 13CO information. This will allow us to study the broader environment of the star forming clouds, constrain the time scales for star formation and cloud disruption in this environment, and study the effects of feedback on the molecular material. The area selected for mapping has excellent ancillary data from the {\\\\em Hubble} Tarantula Treasury Program and velocity-resolved [CII] from SOFIA.',\n"," 'Does scattering reduce the apparent dust mass in protoplanetary disks?. We propose to observe the circumstellar disk around CW Tau at Band 4, 6, 7 and 8 to investigate the scattering-induced optical depth reduction. The optical depth at the millimeter wavelength have used to constrain the disk properties such as the mass of solids. The recent theoretical models have shown that the self-scattering of the dust thermal emission that have been usually ignored in the mass estimate reduces the observed optical depth in the millimeter wavelength significantly, which potentially results into the underestimate in disk mass. To investigate this mechanism and determine the disk mass taking it into account, we observe the CW Tau disk where the millimeter polarization caused by the self-scattering have been detected by the previous observation. Because the effect of scattering is sensitive to the observing frequency, the multi-wavelength observation is useful to tell whether this mechanism indeed operates or not. This mechanism potentially changes our previous interpretation of millimeter continuum observations and hence should be investigated using the object having strong possibility of high scattering albedo.',\n"," 'Physics and Chemistry of Circumstellar Disks in their Earliest Stages. ALMA is uniquely suited to answer questions about how circumstellar disks form around low-mass protostars and how their physics and chemistry evolve until the planet-forming stages. We here propose to utilise the high angular resolution of ALMA to study a candidate for one of the youngest, most deeply embedded circumstellar disks toward the Class 0 protostar NGC1333-IRAS2A. With 10 AU resolution we will: (i) constrain the physics and chemistry of the inner envelope, and putative circumstellar disk, (ii) image the distribution and kinematics of water in the innermost regions around the protostar, and (iii) search for unambiguous evidence for an accretion shock in SiO. Together these observations will allow us to address what the physical and chemical structure is of deeply embedded protostars at the onset and scales of disk formation. If the data show the presence of a circumstellar disk on these scales, the presence or absence of water on the same scales will reveal whether such disks are formed \"wet\" or \"dry\". The presence or absence of an accretion shock will help answering the question of whether chemistry is preserved from the protostellar envelope to the circumstellar disk.',\n"," 'A Quest for the Formation Mechanism of Molecular Filaments. It is a longstanding question how molecular filaments are formed. Recent numerical simulations proposed that the formation of molecular filament requires multiple episodes of supersonic compression such as supernova shocks or stellar winds. W28 is the most famous supernova remnant associated with shocked molecular clouds. Most recently, we revealed many filamentary structures of molecular clouds in the northeastern edge of W28. However, we could not resolve the filaments with sufficient spatial resolution. Moreover, we could not derive physical properties of the filaments due to luck of optically thin data such as 13CO line emission. Here, we propose 13CO(J=2-1) observations toward the molecular filaments associated with W28 using the ALMA stand alone ACA mode with an angular resolution of ~5.7 arcsec (~0.05 pc resolution at the distance of W28). ALMAs unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution will allow us to study the 0.1 pc-scale molecular filaments interacting with SNRs shocks for the first time.',\n"," 'Searching for high-mass pre-stellar cores in an exceptional nursery. The W43-MM1 ridge that is an extreme cloud in terms of concentration and star formation activity, is a case-study to confront models of high-mass star formation. An ALMA Cycle 2 1 mm mosaic of W43-MM1 revealed a rich protocluster of 131 cores, among which 18 able to form a high-mass star. The study of SiO shocks tracing protostellar outflows and chemical complexity associated with protostellar heating led to the preliminary identification of 11 high-mass protostars, 1 high-mass pre-stellar core candidate and six core whose nature remains undefined. The outflow study is however blurred by the richness of the protocluster; all identified outflows are notably confused by neighbor outflows. Hot core investigation is itself limited by the line strength of heated gas strongly diluted within the massive cold envelope of cores. We propose to disentangle and definitively determine the evolutionary status of 18 high-mass cores identified in Cycle 2. We will then give constraints on the most plausible scenario of high-mass star formation using the complete sample of high-mass cores in W43-MM1, their measured turbulence levels and gas mass inflows.',\n"," 'A Moment of Truth with ALMA CN Zeeman Observations: Is Disk Accretion Really Driven by Magnetic Fields?. Magnetic fields are believed to be essential to the process of accretion in circumstellar disks. Attempts to measure the strength and morphology of disk magnetic fields through dust continuum polarization have so far proven unsuccessful; the observed polarization patterns in the disk could be better explained by scattering and radiative alignment. We propose to obtain measurements of the magnetic field strengths in the disks of AS 209 and V4046 Sgr through measurements of Zeeman splitting in the CN 2-1 and CN 1-0 transition lines. Zeeman splitting offers a direct probe of the line-of-sight magnetic field without contamination from scattering and radiative alignment. Observations of the disks magnetic fields will offer evidence for or against current theories of magnetically driven accretion. These observations would significantly advance the commissioning of future Zeeman observations for both disks and star formation.',\n"," 'A unique and massive z=4.3 protocluster from the South Pole Telescope 2500 deg^2 survey.. We propose line spectroscopy and continuum imaging towards the densest protocluster discovered so far, SPT2349-56 at z=4.3. This system has been confirmed, using ALMA in Cy4, to have at least 14 ULIRGs/SMGs detected in dust, CO, and C+ emission within 20\" (integrated SFR of ~10^4 Msun/yr). Since it was found in a blind 1.4-mm survey of 2500 deg^2, it is unlikely there are many other systems like these in the entire sky. The proposed wider field and resolved observations are essential to obtain an unbiased, coherent census of galaxy population in this truly unique protocluster field. Our main goals are threefold (i) characterize the environment, by searching for cluster members in an 8 position mosaic surrounding the LABOCA-detected structure; (ii) determine whether the 4 offset (~2) red SPIRE/LABOCA sources with z_phot~4.3 are in the protocluster -- Given the high density of ULIRGs already detected, we expect to detect a plethora of fainter CO emitting galaxies at z=4.3. And (iii) resolve the 14 core cluster members in C+ and CO7-6/CI/H20 to determine whether they are merger driven or relaxed disks (probing gas, dynamical and stellar masses; multi-line diagnostics of the ISM).',\n"," 'Unlocking large-scale vortices in protoplanetary discs. One serious challenge for planet formation is the rapid inward drift of pebble-sized particles in protoplanetary discs. Dust trapping at local pressure maxima is proposed to stall this drift allowing the formation of planetesimals. The cold dust emission in AB Aurigae forms an asymmetric ring suggestive of dust trapping. Our continuum images at 2mm and 1mm (0.78\"x0.58\") show that the intensity variations along the ring are smaller at 2mm than at 1mm, contrary to what dust trapping models predict. Two-fluid simulations prove that this feature can only arise if the gas vortex has started to decay due to turbulent viscosity, and dust particles are thus losing the azimuthal trapping. Yet, our interpretation is limited by the angular resolution and wavelength coverage of our data. We propose to image the AB Aurigae disc in the continuum at 2mm and 1.3mm, at an angular resolution of 0.07\"-0.15\" to radially and azimuthally characterize the dust trap. Assuming that the dust trap is caused by a giant planet, our simulation indicate a possible detection of dust emission at the Lagrangian point 60 degrees behind the planet. This detection would challenge current planet formation theories.',\n"," 'Biased SMG Formation at a z=3.1 Protocluster. Recently, we discovered a candidate for a extraordinary rich cluster of bright submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at the core of the SSA22 protocluster at z=3.1. We find that 8 SMGs, which are likely to be at z=3.1, are concentrated within 12 Mpc region at the very center of the protocluster. Additionally 4 SMGs are also expected to be within the same protocluster. However the deficit of secure spectroscopic redshifts for 9 out of 12 SMGs prevent us from clarifying the relation between the SMGs and the protocluster (Our photometric redshifts have the typical uncertainty of delta-z=0.5). Here we propose to conduct spectroscopic observations with ALMA band 8 of the 12 SMGs to detect the [CII] 158 um emission line. We will utilize the spectral-scan mode and completely cover the redshift range of the protocluster (z = 3.06-3.12). Our aim is (1) to determine spectroscopic redshifts and unambiguously determine if the SMGs are associated with the protocluster. (2) to probe the nature of the SMGs using the [CII] line properties. The proposed study should clarify the environmental dependence on SMG formation.',\n"," 'A keplerian and resolved disk in the O8-type protostar IRAS16547-4247. This proposal aims to reveal the first case of a truly resolved (< 1000 AU) and Keplerian disk associated with an O-type protostar. We propose to obtain sensitive ALMA long baseline (0.05\") observations of IRAS 16547-4247 at 0.85 mm. This source is a young and relatively nearby (2.9 kpc) O8-type young star. The 0.85 mm continuum observations will resolve the dust emission detected by Zapata et al. (2015) towards IRAS 16547 to measure the dimensions of the putative disk, while line observations will help in searching for Keplerian motions in the innermost parts of the disk.',\n"," 'Dissecting the circumstellar disk around the B-type protostar IRAS20126+4104. The existence of disk+outflow systems around early-type stars has been invoked by theorists to overcome the powerful radiation pressure by the star and allow the accretion onto the star to proceed up to 140 Msun. Despite their importance, only recently bona-fide disk candidates have been detected around B-type (>8 Msun) protostars. IRAS20126+4104 is by far the best of these. Both the close distance (1.64kpc) and the well studied disk+outflow system make this the ideal target for a high-resolution study with ALMA. With the proposed observations we will for the first time establish the rotation curve and disk physical parameters (temperature, column density) as a function of radius. Our observations will be a breakthrough, as little is known on the nature of the disks around B-type stars because the resolution attainable before ALMA was insufficient to properly resolve them. In particular, we will obtain the following: calculate the Toomre Q parameter as a function of radius and assess if the disk is stable, compute the stellar mass and accretion rate through the disk onto the star, and establish the presence of gaps and/or local instabilities, possibly induced by stellar companions.',\n"," 'A Pilot Study for the Far-IR Confirmation of the Oldest Galaxies Observed by JWST. We propose ALMA observation of the recently discovered galaxy candidate, GLz11 at z=10.74, from the JWST ERS program. JWST will routinely discover these early galaxies and can do a census of similar z>10 galaxies to understand the first galaxy formation. ALMA is the only instrument with the sensitivity to detect the FIR continuum and fine structure from such an object, and has a strong synergy with the JWST observation to study the high-redshift galaxy formation. The observation of FIR SED including cooling line is very important to measure the spectroscopic redshift and constrain the physical parameters from SED modeling in terms of constraining dust content to break the age-dust degeneracy. Our program will observe the FIR peak of GLz11 with spectral window set up covered by 3 Science Goals such that 88.63micron [OIII] emission line is included in the sufficient redshift range (z=10.30-11.21) for spectroscopic redshift confirmation. The proposed observation has the very real potential to both verify a key science program for the JWST by confirming an extreme redshift galaxy, and demonstrate the importance of ALMA in the JWST era for studying the first galaxies in the Universe.',\n"," 'How does the large scale magnetic field affect the infall in prestellar cores?. Lupus I is a low-mass star-forming filament currently undergoing a star-forming event. Polarization measurements from optical polarimetry (Franco & Alves 2015) and dust polarization (Matthews et al. 2014) have revealed that the large scale magnetic field is oriented perpendicularly to the main filament axis and that the cloud is magnetically supported. The orientation of the prestellar cores, gravitationally bound objects which are expected to form stars, are found to be often oriented parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field, suggesting an influence of the magnetic field on the formation and/or evolution of prestellar cores. We propose a detailed gas kinematics study of one class 0 object and eight prestellar cores: four oriented perpendicular and four parallel to the magnetic field, resolving the major axis of the prestellar core to differentiate between the infall motions along the minor and major core axis, and compare these infall motions with models of ambipolar diffusion.',\n"," 'The ultimate test for quasar feedback in the early Universe: ultradeep observations of the most luminous quasar at z>6. Quasar feedback is deemed as a fundamental ingredient for galaxy evolution and transformation. The detection of passive, massive and old galaxies at z~4 requires extreme quasar feedback to be already active by z>6. Yet, it has been suggested that at z~6 quasar-driven massive and energetic outflows are absent or ineffective in suppressing star formation in their host galaxies at the required levels. However, previous observations may have been plagued but lack of sensitivity to extended emission required to detect outflows and/or by issues associated with stacking techniques. We propose the ultimate test for the quasar feedback at z>6 by obtaining very deep observations of [CII] and of low-frequency continuum, with configurations optimised to extended emission, in order to detect and characterise the properties of the outflow driven by this quasar, at the peak of its activity and BH accretion, and also to detect its effect on the halo heating through the SZ effect, which may result into a delayed feedback (hence quenching by starvation) already in place at such early epoch.',\n"," 'Extending the GEMS sample of brightest gravitational lenses. Strong lensing has many applications, but the number of known examples is still small and more are needed - particularly for probing the statistics of halo substructure to constrain dark matter properties. Some of the submm-brightest lensed systems come from the Planck+Herschel-selected GEMS sample. In hindsight the selection process for this was too conservative, as well as deliberately favouring northern objects. We have found 15 additional Planck+Herschel-selected sources consistent with strong gravitational lensing, and we propose to confirm them using ALMA continuum imaging at 870 um. These observations will not only extend the number of known strong lenses significantly, but also allow us to begin studying their dark matter morphologies, eventually leading to much better contraints on the dark matter power spectrum on small scales than has been previously possible.',\n"," 'First detection of 15N2H+ - a sink for interstellar heavy nitrogen?. Nitrogen isotope fractionation in prestellar cores, protostars, and protoplanetary disks is still not well understood. Because the main reservoirs, N2 and N, cannot be measured directly, our measurements rely on observations of tracer molecules. A particularly puzzling picture is thereby presented by N2H+, which shows not only a large scatter in 14N/15N ratios, but also strong depletion in a prestellar core, which current fractionation models cannot explain. One possible scenario is that 15N is hidden from our current view in the form of doubly substituted 15N2H+, similar to the high abundances of doubly deuterated molecules. Predictions for laboratory spectroscopy of 15N2H+ were recently published and allow us to search for 15N2H+ for the first time. We propose to search for 15N2H+ in the prestellar core 16293E, for which N15NH+ was already detected. These observations will prove the first measurement of a doubly 15N-substituted molecule, investigating their importance in nitrogen isotopic fractionation, and thereby advance our understanding of the origin of the nitrogen isotopic heterogeneity of the solar system.',\n"," 'Revisiting the slope of black hole scaling relations for spiral galaxies. The evolution of massive black holes (MBH) and their host galaxies appear to be closely connected as several tight scaling relations suggest. It is still debated what exact evolutionary path galaxies of different morphology follow. Sahu et al. 2019 compiled MBH masses derived from different dynamical tracers and showed that early-type and late-type galaxies (ETG/LTGs) follow scaling relations with very different slopes. When only using the subset of MBH masses derived from cold gas, we noticed that the LTGs significantly deviated from the Sahu et al. 2019 relations. We propose to use ALMA observations to derive robust dynamical measurements of MBH masses in a sample of 12 nearby LTGs. The high resolution of ALMA observations will map the kinematics of the rotating nuclear molecular gas disk, resolve the black holes sphere of influence, and allow us to measure the MBH mass precisely. Our measurements will provide new constraints (1) on the slope of the LTG scaling relations and the cause of the mentioned discrepancy, (2) on the pitch angle - MBH scaling relation as diagnostic tool for low-mass LTGs and (3) on the secular evolution of LTGs with respect to their central black hole.',\n"," 'Gas mass fractions in z>3 main sequence galaxies from ALESS. The ECDFS is one of the best studied cosmological deep fields. Through a 10 year effort, we have uniquely characterized the 870 micron selected galaxy population in this field across the electro-magnetic spectrum. One of the unique properties of this galaxy sample is its large number of main sequence galaxies at z~2 to 5. As major contributors to the comoving star formation rate density, these sources provide a unique laboratory to study the evolution of the comoving gas mass density and to relate the gas content of galaxies to the evolution of the star formation rate density at redshifts z>2.5. So far no consensus of the comoving gas mass density measured in representative galaxies at these early epochs has been emerged. We here propose to improve on this situation by adding gas mass estimates from CO line and long-wavelength dust continuum emission in ~20 main sequence galaxies in 3 redshift bins between z=2 to 5. Our study aims to cross calibrate CO and dust based gas mass estimates in our 870 micron selected sources with existing surveys at z=2-3 and to add new estimates of the gas mass fraction based on both techniques in two more redshift bins at z=3-4 and z=4-5.',\n"," 'Ice and Gas: Novel insights into the cold chemistry of molecular cloud cores. During the epoch when molecular cloud cores collapse to form young protostars surrounded by circumstellar disks, many molecules arefrozen out as ices on the surfaces of dust grains. The fraction of volatile molecules on icy grains may play an important role in determining the eventual architectures and compositions of planetary systems. Still, many questions remain concerning the exact interplay between volatiles in ice and gas, for example: how dependent is the chemical composition on the initial dense cloud core environment and its subsequent evolution during collapse? To address these questions we propose to map a highly extincted region of the Chamaeleon star-forming cloud complex with the ACA in well-defined molecular tracers of physical conditions and the on-going chemical processes therein. Infrared ice maps will be obtained for this same region with the James Webb Space Telescope as part of the IceAge Early Release Science program in 2022. The coupling of the gas-phase ACA observations of low excitation lines with the deep solid-phase JWST data will provide novel insights into the interplay between gas and ice in cold dense regions of star formation.',\n"," 'What are the best conditions for shielded debris disks?. Many main-sequence stars are surrounded by debris disks, similar to the asteroid/Kuiper belts in our Solar System. A recent discovery is that massive debris disks may harbor a substantial amount of CO gas, a novel aspect in disk evolution. Half of the gaseous debris disks contain an unexpectedly high amount of CO, requiring an efficient shielding from the UV field. So far shielded CO disks were mainly found around young A1-A7-type stars at relatively large stellocentric radii. Here we propose a systematic exploration of the parameter space, by searching for CO in dust-rich debris disks around F1-A8 and A0-type stars, and also observing systems with more compact disks. Using our proposed ALMA Band 6 observations of a carefully compiled target list (including new debris disk discoveries) we will search for CO, characterize the geometry and mass of the gas disk, and look for correlation with environment parameters. Our project will determine for the first time the physical conditions where shielded debris disks could exist, and use a population synthesis model of the results to outline the evolution of gaseous debris disks.',\n"," 'The Distribution of Extended Source Species in a Bright Apparition TOO Comet. Certain molecules observed towards cometary atmospheres have a physical distribution that cannot be explained as direct sublimation from the nucleus or gas-phase chemistry within the coma. The extended source of these species is not known, though it is believed to be an organic mixture or degradation of dust. As part of a joint collaborative multiwavelength effort, we will conduct an observational survey of extended source species and their possible parent or related molecules in a target of opportunity comet. This study will image CO, H2CO, and CH3OH. These observations will help constrain the origin and extent of the distributed source for each species, the scalelength of the source, establish accurate molecular abundances, and provide insight into comet chemistry. These results will build off observations of these molecules in Comet C/202012 S1 (ISON) and C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) previously obtained with ALMA. The target of opportunity comet should have Q(H2O) ~ 1e29 s-1, and may be a new dynamical object or a known apparition undergoing an outburst event.',\n"," 'A pilot search for new FIR absorbers at z~1 on three gravitaionally lensed SPT sources. Observations of absorption lines from the foreground intervening gas in the spectra of background bright sources have allowed direct constraints on gas abundances. This technique has been widely used in UV/optical/NIR for over a decade, however such studies in FIR/submillimeter at cosmological distances (z>0.1) are restricted to only three gravitationally lensed systems, and new absorbers have not been found for over a decade. Our 2500 degree-square SPT survey has uncovered over 100 bright submillimeter galaxies, the majority of which are strong galaxy-galaxy lensed so ideal for searches of new FIR absorbers. In this pilot study we propose to target prominent absorption lines in CI and CO, on three lensing systems at z~1. The foreground lens galaxies have confirmed spectroscopic redshifts and star-forming activites based on their optical spectra. We aim to directly measure the abundances of CI and CO in the line-of-sight and compare the results to galactic molecular clouds as well as other FIR absorbers. Discovery of any absorber will provide a major step forward in the studies of FIR absorption, and lead to a full search in our SPT sample.',\n"," 'The complex interplay between gas accretion and stellar feedbacks in primordial galaxies. We have observed the [CII] emission in two normal protogalaxies, with SFR~6 Msun/yr at z>7. For the galaxy with the deepest observation we detect [CII] emission at redshift z=7.107, fully consistent with the Lyalpha redshift, but spatially offset by 0.7\"(4 kpc) from the optical emission (Maiolino et al.2015). These results support expectations from recent models that molecular clouds in the central parts of primordial galaxies are rapidly disrupted by stellar feedback. As a result, [CII] emission mostly arises from more external accreting clumps of neutral gas. Cycle 2 [OIII] observations support that most of the gas contained in the galaxy is swept away from feedback mechanism. We detect three [OIII] clumps within a radius of 15 kpc from the Lyalpha emitters. However the low sensitivity of [CII] and [OIII] observations is no sufficient to map the distribution of these clumps around the star-forming galaxy as expected by models. We propose deeper [OIII] and [CII] observations in Cycle 4. By reaching a sensitivity 2x higher than previous observations, we will map in detail the distribution of the accreting gas clumps and will provide information on the gas accretion rate.',\n"," 'Is [CI] emission a reliable molecular gas tracer in galactic disks?. We propose a sensitive mapping of the [CI](1-0) line emission from the galactic disk of the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3627. Combined with existing ALMA observations tracing the properties of its giant molecular clouds (GMCs) (from our PHANGS CO(2-1) survey), CO isotopologue maps (from EMPIRE survey), Herschel dust maps plus new optical MUSE IFU maps to characterize star-forming environments, we will address the following questions: (1) what is the [CI] conversion factor to molecular gas mass in a galactic disk environment? (2) do we see variations for the conversion factor with galactic environment? (3) how does it compare to the CO conversion factor? These questions are very timely to address as theoretical work has suggested that [CI] emission should be a highly reliable gas tracer in galaxies. However, observations of local (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies and galaxy centers suggest that the situation might be more complicated. Though all these studies have focused on more extreme environments than those present in the disk (as proposed here). Given the easy access to this line for high redshift galaxies a thorough assessment of the [CI] as the gas tracer is urgently needed.',\n"," 'Cloud-Scale CO excitation drivers in nearby galaxies targeted with JWST. Understanding CO excitation conditions is increasingly essential, especially in the extragalactic context, where several different CO lines are used to trace the molecular gas. The CO(3-2)/(2-1) line ratio (R32) is easily accessible to ALMA and appears very sensitive to CO excitation but has not been studied much in other galaxies. The R32 studies that do exist have poor resolution and large calibration uncertainties. Here, we propose new high-quality CO(3-2) mapping of five strongly barred spiral galaxies that have high-resolution ALMA CO(2-1) and public Cycle 1 JWST mid-IR imaging that directly traces embedded star formation expected to drive excitation at high resolution. We will use these new maps to produce high S/N, <100-pc scale, well-calibrated R32 line ratio measurements. Then, we will correlate R32 variation to parameters such as the gas surface density, gas velocity dispersion, and heating by young stellar populations. This will provide some of the best measurements to date of how CO excitation varies across galaxies, how star formation may alter excitation conditions, and how this might affect CO-to-H2 conversion factor estimates using different CO transitions.',\n"," 'An Investigation of Latitudinal Variations in Titans Atmospheric CH4. As the progenitor of myriad trace organics that compose Titans substantial atmosphere, placing constraints on the abundance and distribution of CH4 has been a fundamental driver for observations, photochemical, dynamical, and formation models of Titan. Previous measurements of Titans CH4 abundance profile were made using the Huygens probe, and subsequently used throughout the Cassini era to derive Titans stratospheric temperatures in the IR. Lellouch et al. (2014) observed variations in stratospheric CH4 between 1-1.5% as a function of latitude. However, further studies measuring spatial variations in CH4 have not been completed. Following the sub-mm detection of the CH3D on Titan (Thelen et al. 2019), we propose to observe CH3D in ALMA Band 9 with high spatial resolution and sensitivity. By simultaneously measuring temperature using CO and HCN we may infer CH4 abundances at ~10 distinct latitude regions across Titan and investigate spatial variability in Titans mesopause for the first time. The confirmation of CH4 and temperature variations with latitude will prove crucial for dynamical and photochemical models, and further our understanding of Titans complex atmosphere.',\n"," 'Unveiling the distribution of the cosmic-rays ionization rate with ALMA. Cosmic rays are a global ionisation source and play a pivotal role in determining the chemical composition and ionisation fraction of the interstellar medium, with critical effects on both the star and planet formation process. However, the cosmic ray ionisation rate (CRIR) represents one of the bottlenecks for astrochemical models, and its determination is one of the most puzzling problems for modern astrophysics. In diffuse clouds, H3+ observations allowed reasonable estimates of CRIR, while for dense clouds, this is not possible due to the lack of rotational transitions, and estimates are strongly biased by the employed model. Recently, a new analytical approach to estimate the CRIR in the densest regions of molecular clouds has been proposed. The latter is model-independent and based on the estimate of the H3+ column density from its deuterated forms, known to be very abundant in dense and cold star-forming regions. With this proposal, we aim to obtain the first high-resolution maps of CRIR in two massive clumps where multiple cores were observed for the first time with ALMA in oH2D+, providing crucial constraints for chemical/physical modelling of star-forming regions.',\n"," 'Unveiling the enigmatic AGB star GX Mon. The evolution of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars is characterised by mass loss, however the details of the interplay between the different mechanisms involved and the role of binarity in shaping the resulting planetary nebula remain unclear. The necessary constraints can be derived from maps of the morphology and velocity distribution of the gaseous circumstellar envelope, which ALMA has proved to be the ideal instrument for. We propose to use CO and other tracers to map the morphology and velocity distribution of the circumstellar envelope around GX Mon, a rather intriguing oxygen-rich Mira variable. Recent VLBI observations of SiO masers in the extended atmosphere of the star show a velocity gradient indicative of rotation, which may be related to an unseen binary companion that could be inferred from our observations. Additionally, HST data reveal a structure at around 3500 AU from the star that is tantalisingly reminiscent of a detached shell. If confirmed, this would make GX Mon the first oxygen-rich AGB star to be associated with a history of thermal pulses.',\n"," 'Characterizing Protoplanetary Disks in the Orion L1641 Region. Here we propose to greatly expand and diversify the sample of young disks observed in the millimeter with Lynds 1641 (L1641), a populous ~1 Myr region located within the large Orion Molecular Complex at a distance of ~400 pc. L1641 contains a broad range of stellar assemblages, masses, and disk evolutionary states, permitting a comparative study of disks across these properties. We will search for correlations of the vertical structure (disk settling) and disk dust masses between various spectral types (F0-M8), disk types (full vs. transitional disks), and star-forming environments (isolated vs. clustered). We propose to observe 101 disks in L1641 at 1.3 mm (band 6) with a flexible resolution range of 0.5\" to 1.5\" (200-600 AU) to create one of the largest catalogs of ~1 Myr old protoplanetary disk masses and demographics yet. This large and well-characterized sample will contribute to future debates on the process of planet formation as it provides key information for a unique region to study fundamental disk properties across a broad range of conditions.',\n"," 'Serpens South: Outflows impacting the youngest, densest proto-cluster. In the earliest stages of star formation, molecular outflows from protostars entrain gas, inject energy and momentum into protostellar clusters and perhaps drive turbulence in a cloud. In a very young, dense cluster environment, the encounter probability of outflows with other forming protostars is high, so these outflows may affect subsequent star formation, as well as sculpt their nascent environment. We propose ALMA observations of the youngest, densest protostellar cluster Serpens South, located relatively nearby at 415 pc. With a resolution of 1.5 arcseconds (600 AU at 415 pc) and the sensitivity of ALMA, we will observe CO isotopologues with Band 6 in order to resolve individual outflows, identify their driving sources, and assess their impact on the surrounding cluster environment on physical scales of 0.003-0.3 pc. We will map a mosaic of 120x165 arcsec, within which 42 YSOs are known to reside. A remarkable 90 percent of these sources are Class 0 or I, young protostars which drive the most energetic outflows. This proposal is the critical component in a comprehensive study of outflow-cloud interaction, for both its sensitivity and resolution on scales very near to the driving sources of protostellar outflows within a dense cluster environment.',\n"," 'The Molecular Exosphere of Ceres: Pinpointing Its Surface Origins. Observations of water ice and hazes on Ceres by Dawn Space Mission point to the existence of an exosphere. Based on existing ALMA data, we establish the presence of Ceres exosphere. To reveal the true nature of the molecular exosphere, we propose high resolution observations to resolve Ceres disk spatially so to locate the surface origins of Ceres exosphere. Our ultimate goal is to: 1) pinpoint exact locations of solar sputtering and/or outgassing plumes; 2) associate the exospheric molecular species with surface features hence compositions to better understand ice chemistry; 3) distinguish molecular excitation mechanisms; 4) identify potentially plume-launching subsurface sites of reservoirs enriched in water ice; and 5) ascertain the viability of Ceres cometary origin via accretion or formation at great heliocentric distance.',\n"," 'Constraining the Jupiter Equatorial Oscillation from ALMA direct wind measurements. An equatorial quasi-periodic oscillation in temperature and wind direction was discovered in the 1950s in Earths stratosphere. Comparable equatorial stratospheric oscillations exist in Jupiter and Saturn. Our project aims at better understanding the processes that cause and maintain the Jupiter Equatorial Oscillation (JEO), which occurs between 1 and 30 mbar. We propose to map the winds around Jupiters equator at two different stratospheric levels. We will observe at 1 mbar, using HCN(4-3), and 5 mbar, using CO(3-2). These two levels in the stratosphere are, respectively, the levels where the JEO is generated and a level where the JEO winds can reach ~200 m/s. We also propose to produce two wind maps separated by 6 months (March and September 2022) to investigate how the vertical structure of the JEO zonal winds evolves at different phases of the oscillation.',\n"," 'Twin disks in FU Ori: Episodic accretion via binary interactions?. FU Oris are low-mass pre-main sequence stars characterized by dramatic outbursts during which stars may gain a significant portion of their mass. Proposed mechanisms which could drive these episodic accretion events include gravitational and thermal instabilities, disk fragmentation, forming planets and stellar encounters. Most interestingly, the archetypical FU Ori system, FU Oriorins itself, is a known binary composed of two disks separated by only 0.5\" that have been detected in gas and dust during Cycle 0. These data, although reaveling clear signs of interaction in the system, suffered from low sensitivity and poor resolution and the disks are only partially resolved. How does this binarity and mass exchange/interaction affect the scenarios which aim at explaining episodic accretion? We propose to map the gas and dust in FU Ori at 50 mas resolution in band 6 to build a comprehensive picture of the dynamics of the system. We aim to capture dynamic interaction through CO isotopologue kinematics and compare these with dedicated hydrodynamic simulations. Mapping both disks in continuum is also a pressing need to distinguish between outburst mechanisms.',\n"," 'Paradigm-shifting ALMA observations of the unusually-bright comet C/2012 F6 (Lemmon). Cometary ices contain material left over from the birth of the solar system, and studying their composition provides an important source of information regarding the physical and chemical conditions of the early Solar Nebula. Previous observations have been unable to ascertain the precise origin of fundamental coma species H2CO, HCN and HNC, and details regarding their possible formation in the coma are currently not well understood. We propose to follow up our recent VLT and APEX studies of the bright comet C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and map the strong sub-mm emission lines of HCN, HNC, H2CO and CH3OH using ALMA. We will obtain spatially and spectrally-resolved emission profiles to ascertain the origin of these molecules and place constraints on the mechanisms by which they are released into the coma. The proposed investigation could revolutionise our understanding of the origins of HCN, HNC and H2CO in comets. Our proposal is submitted for DDT because F6 Lemmon has far-exceeded earlier expectations for its brightness and gas-production rates. It is currently among the most active comets seen since Hale Bopp, and is expected to remain so for the next few weeks.',\n"," 'Luminous, Dust-Enshrouded High-z Galaxies Selected by Gamma-Ray Bursts. Recent observations have demonstrated that a substantial fraction of GRBs originate from heavily dust-obscured and luminous galaxies at z>1, a population that until recently was not thought to produce GRBs in significant numbers. This discovery has important implications for the connection between GRBs and the overall star-formation rate, suggesting that GRBs can occur in massive and dusty galaxies under certain conditions. We propose to obtain ALMA continuum observations of the ULIRG hosts of six GRBs at z~2 to directly measure their obscured star formation rates, resolve the structure of the hosts in dust emission, and determine whether the bursts originate from compact super-starbursts or more classical modes of star formation. These observations will fill a critical gap in our knowledge of the GRB population, identifying the physical conditions necessary to form GRBs in the high-redshift universe and providing new insight on the nature of the GRB progenitor and its ability to probe conditions in the most dust-enshrouded galaxies.',\n"," 'Investigating the origin of the IMF and constraining SFR models in the W43-MM1 mini-starbust ridge. Studying extreme protoclusters is necessary to test if the IMF origin and SFE can be independent of cloud local characteristics. The W43-MM1 ridge, being extreme in terms of cloud concentration and star formation activity, is a case-study to confront star formation models. It consists of a very dense and cold mass reservoir of 20 000 Msun. We discovered that it hosts a cluster of 11 massive dense cores. With untested assumptions regarding the fragmentation of massive dense cores into protostars and the shape of the stellar IMF, we expect more than 2000 stars to form, with a SFR of 6000 Msun/Myr reminiscent of starburst galaxies. A preliminary study of the mass distribution in the W43-MM1 mini-starburst ridge suggests that statistical SFR models do not apply to ridge clouds. We propose to investigate the fragmentation of W43-MM1, down to the now well-defined protostellar size of 2000 AU. We especially want to 1) look for protostars and prestellar cores able to form early O-type stars, 2) define the size/density inside/above which the core mass function does not mimic the IMF anymore, and 3) accurately measure the SFE correlation to the cloud density and turbulence level.',\n"," 'Characterizing the Decline of Massive Protostellar Outbursts. The discovery of 3 accretion outbursts in massive protostars over the past 4 years has motivated new hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar accretion. The results suggest that massive stars gain up to 40-60% of their total mass from episodic accretion, with an inverse relation between outburst duration and peak luminosity. All three of the outbursts arose from protostars that power copious hot core line emission, and each event triggered methanol maser flares. Two of the three outbursts (NGC6334I-MM1 and G358.93-0.03-MM1) remain at elevated luminosities after 6 and 2 years, respectively, and tracking their decline is a key observable to constrain future theory. Our primary goal is to continue characterizing the luminosity evolution of these objects by gathering a new epoch of multi-wavelength millimeter continuum and mid-IR images. With ALMA, in addition to comparing the dust continuum light curve with the maser light curve, we will also be able measure whether the thermal line excitation temperatures, physical extent, and velocity structure have altered since the initial peak of the outbursts, which will impact future studies of hot core chemistry.',\n"," 'Understanding column densities toward massive gas flows in gas-rich central galaxies. ALMA has shown that radio AGN drive massive flows of molecular gas in central cluster galaxies. The molecular gas has likely condensed from low entropy gas in the cluster core that has been lifted by X-ray cavities. However, the uplifted masses rival the maximum mass that the cavities can lift, implying a remarkably efficient coupling. Measurements of column density in these massive molecular flows are required to accurately calibrate the uplifted mass, instead of relying on the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion. We propose to test this by mapping the distribution of molecular gas in Zw3146 using every CO transition up to CO(4-3). Zw3146 is a prime candidate to address this issue as it is both extremely gas-rich and is experiencing a powerful AGN outburst, making it an ideal candidate for hosting AGN-driven gas flows. It is also one of the few BCGs in which all four low-J CO lines can be observed by ALMA. These observations will allow the column density and CO-to-H2 conversion factor to be measured in both the molecular filaments and the nuclear gas, revealing any spatial variations in gas excitation and molecular mass calibration. This will be the first analysis of its kind in a BCG.',\n"," 'Small but mighty: Reconciling a paradoxical low-mass, ultra-dusty galaxy at z=4.27. The existence of dust in the early Universe and in low mass galaxies challenges our understanding of how metals are built up over cosmic time. We propose to exploit a strongly-lensed galaxy from the Frontier Fields at z=4.27 whose stellar mass is a mere 4e9Msun but where the majority of the star formation is obscured by dust. With an existing [CII] detection, this galaxy provides the ideal laboratory to explore primitive interstellar medium conditions, and put first constraints on the metallicity. Specifically, we propose to (1) quantify the ionized gas with [NII]205 and determine the neutral fraction of [CII], (2) measure the CO(4-3) luminosity and combine with [CII], [NII] and LIR to constrain the radiation field and gas density, and (3) use the 600 micron rest continuum emission to establish the total dust mass. Together these observations will clarify the unusual conditions that led to a low-mass, ultra-dusty galaxy only 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang.',\n"," 'Growing Brighest Cluster Galaxies: a statistical study of the molecular fuel at early times. We are undertaking a multi-faceted study of the in-situ stellar mass growth of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) through cosmic time. These systems are the most massive galaxies at any epoch and form at the dense centres of galaxy clusters. Once thought to be outliers they are now recognized as sensitive probes of hierarchical structure formation proceses such as gas cooling, galaxy merging and energy feedback mechanisms. Coupling Spitzer-MIPS observations of the Spitzer Adapatation of the Red Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS) to the OzDES spectroscopic survey has produced the largest spectroscopic sample of BCGs beyond z > 0.3 to date. Here we propose to undertake the first statistical and systematic study of the molecular gas content of a large number (63 total, 33 in this proposal) of spectroscopically confirmed BCGs. We aim to control, for the first time, for the degenerate properties of star formation efficency and redshift. This unique study will elucidate the in-situ mass growth of BCGs and provide constraints for models which currently struggle to reproduce the star forming properties of BCGs at early times.',\n"," 'Molecular outflows, accreting spirals and a circumbinary disk in a young binary system. Recent results of exo-planetary surveys have revealed that planets can orbit and survive around binary stars. This suggests that there are some fraction of young binary systems which possess massive circumbinary (CB) disks are in the midst of planet formation. Among the few known binary systems where the CB disks have been detected, the UY Aurigae system appears very active in accretion. Signs of accreting streamers connecting the CB disk and the stars and molecular outflows have been detected. We propose to study this system on how material accretes toward the CB disk and toward the circumstellar disks. We request two science goals: 1) in Band 7 observations of the CO isotopologues and continuum at 0.8 mm with 1.0 resolution in the C36-2 configuration to determine the properties of the CB disk and 2) in Band 6 observations of the 1.3 mm continuum, CO isotopologues and SO lines with 0.2 resolution in the C36-6 configuration to resolve the CS disks in continuum and in CO lines. This study will constrain the angular momentum transfer between the CB and CS disks, providing information on how disks around binary systems form and evolve towards planet formation.',\n"," 'Mapping the Envelope-Disk Transition around a Massive Protostar. If massive stars form in a similar way as low-mass stars, a relatively ordered transition from an infalling/rotating envelope to a Keplerian disk is expected. Such a transition, similar to the case in low-mass star formation, should be seen in changes of both gas kinematics and chemical conditions. We propose ALMA Band 6 observations toward the massive protostar G339.88-1.26, a Keplerian disk candidate discovered in our previous ALMA project. We aim to carry out high-resolution mapping of the disk, inner envelope and transition region, as well as the base of the jet, with selected groups of molecules: SiO/NaCl to trace the disk (or disk surface), SO/SO2 to trace the shocked transition region and/or the outer part of the disk, CH3OH/H2CO to trace the envelope, CH3CN to trace the envelope and/or disk, and H2O/HDO to trace the transition region. Such observations will allow us to characterize the angular momentum transfer from the envelope to the disk and outflow, and constrain the disk properties in massive star formation. This study can potentially be developed into a general diagnostic tool for future searches for Keplerian disks around massive protostars.',\n"," 'Hot on the Trail of Millimeter Emission from the Coolest Stars. Certain ultracool dwarfs (stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types M7 and later) display surprisingly high levels of magnetic activity. Since recent results imply that magnetism in this regime is much more \"planetary\" than \"stellar\" in nature, studies of these objects can shed light on the magnetospheric physics of massive extrasolar planets, which are currently not directly accessible. While ultracool magnetism has primarly been diagnosed at centimeter wavelengths thus far, we have recently used ALMA to achieve the first two detections of millimeter emission from (disk-free) ultracool dwarfs, opening a new window in this field: short synchrotron lifetimes at these wavelengths offer the chance to better understand how these cool objects can accelerate electrons to relativistic speeds. We have identified two additional probable mm emitters and propose to attempt to detect them with ALMA, completing the census of such objects known at this time. Detections will double the number of mm-emitting ultracool dwarfs; upper limits would imply new high-frequency behavior compared to our first two detections.',\n"," '[HCN]/[HNC]: A fundamental problem in Astrophysics. The two isomers of the H-C-N system, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), are commonly used as tracers of the dense molecular gas in Galactic and extra-galactic research. Moreover, the [HCN]/[HNC]is considered as a chemical diagnostic for the gas temperature. The full comprehension of the HCN and HNC chemistry is therefore of paramount importance in the study of the physics and chemistry of the interstellar gas. In the latest years, gas phase and gas-grain chemical models have increased in complexity and incorporated new laboratory measurements to provide an accurate and complete description of their chemistry. However, high spatial resolution and high sensitivity data are needed to test these models. Based on our IRAM 30m 2D spectral survey, we have measured an anomalously high [HCN]/[HNC]ratio (larger than 10) towards the ultracompact HII region Mon R2. Time dependent effects and photodesorption have been proposed as possible explanations. Our goal is to determine the [HCN]/[HNC] ratio at a spatial resolution of 1-arcsec in order to discern between these two interpretations and investigate the influence of UV photons on the chemistry of the H-C-N system.',\n"," 'Fragmentation in Hi-GAL clumps. The earliest stages of (high-mass) star formation are thought to be characterised by the breaking up of a molecular cloud into smaller objects, which then collapse into clumps (the precursors of star clusters) or cores (the precursors of single stars). We propose to probe for multiplicity a sample of cold and massive clumps extracted from the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane survey Hi-GAL. The sample we propose represents the prototypes of protostellar clusters (or single objects), a phase in which fragmentation has produced the cores that will form stars. Establishing the frequency of fragmentation and the physical properties of cores in clumps will allow us to understand how massive stars form. This is the first time that an unbiased large sample of cold and massive objects can be selected on the basis of observations at wavelengths longward of 100 microns and represents therefore a golden opportunity to study the early stages of the formation of stellar clusters. We request 15 hours of observations with the most extended configuration of the ALMA array in band 6.',\n"," 'Explosive Outflows from Compact Groups of Forming Massive Protostars. The OMC1 explosion, ~0.1 pc behind the Orion Nebula, was powered by an N-body interaction that ejected 3 stars as runaways ~550 years ago. We propose to image three other candidate explosive protostellar outflows in molecules, H30-alpha, and the 1.3 mm continuum. They contain fingers of shock-excited molecular hydrogen, bullets, and streamers similar to Orion OMC1. Their radial velocity structure will determine if they were powered by a nearly instantaneous explosion or a quasi-steady injection of energy by winds or jets. Their masses, momenta, and kinetic energies, the locations of their source stars, and dynamical ages will be measured. Explosive protostellar outflows represent a new type of feedback in cluster-forming regions that may contribute significantly to the self-regulation of star formation. They are signposts of violent, N-body interactions or major accretion events. N-body interactions that eject stars from their birth environment by more than a few km/s will terminate accretion, set the final masses of the ejected stars, and if common, may play an important role in establishing the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of stars. This program will constrain the event rate.',\n"," 'Fueling and quenching star formation in and around z~0.5 galaxy clusters. This project aims at providing a self-consistent picture of how galaxy evolution is impacted by the environment, with particular emphasis on how star formation is quenched. We propose to target the CO(3-2) line in the ALMA Band 6 in and around two medium mass galaxy clusters at z~0.5, CL1411.1-1148 and CL1301.7-1139, which will deliver unprecedented molecular gas information for 53 star forming galaxies located in low density regions, filaments, groups, and clusters all belonging to the same large scale networks. We will address the following fundamental open questions: - Does the global molecular content of cluster galaxies increase with lookback time as it does for field galaxies? Are the factors of increase comparable? - How strong is the depletion in cold gas from the cluster outskirts to their inner regions? To which extent do the surrounding overdensities play a pre-processing role?',\n"," 'Molecular Gas in Dusty Quasars: Fuelling the Formation of Massive Galaxies at z~2.5. We propose to detect 12CO(3-2) in 4 dust-obscured (Av~2.5), high luminosity (Lbol~1e14 L0), high star formation rate (SFR > 500 M0/yr) quasars at z~2.5 that are caught in a transformative, radiative-feedback dominated phase as they are transitioning from massive starburst galaxies to unobscured quasars. These dust obscured quasars are the highest luminosity quasars currently known at the main epoch of galaxy and supermassive black hole assembly. The proposed CO detection experiment will lead to a five-fold increase in the number of z~2-3 intrinsically luminous, ALMA-accessible quasars where molecular gas has been detected, thus paving the way for future high-resolution observations to look for signatures of AGN triggering and feedback in these systems. Previous searches for molecular gas in high redshift quasars have tended to focus on gravitationally lensed, intrinsically lower luminosity systems or quasars at redshifts above 4. Studying the molecular gas in our high luminosity, highly star-forming quasar hosts will therefore enable new insights into the interplay between star formation and black hole accretion at an epoch when both quantities were at their peak.',\n"," 'Exploring the Exosphere of Europa. Jupiters moon Europa is a high priority target in the search for life outside Earth, but direct investigations of the subsurface ocean are hindered by an exterior ice shell. While the surface and atmospheric compositions are intimately connected through sputtering, sublimation and freezeout, Europas recently-identified atmospheric plumes provide a potential bridge between the atmosphere and ocean. We propose to detect and map H2O gas (in addition to SO2, HCN and H2CO), for the first time on Europa, as a probe of the exosphere and plume properties. Constraining the baseline atmospheric H2O density will (1) provide crucial information to assist in flyby planning for the upcoming JUICE mission, and (2) place rigorous constraints on Europas surface ice properties and sputtering yields - in particular, the interactions between solid H2O and heavy ions and electrons from Jupiters magnetosphere. The detection of spatially isolated molecular plumes would revolutionize our understanding of physical and chemical interactions between ocean, crust and surface on Europa and other icy worlds, opening up a new avenue of research into subsurface ocean composition and habitability.',\n"," 'AGN Feedback in Action: The Molecular Outflow in the Nearest Active Galactic Nucleus. Galactic winds/outflows are poorly understood although they are essential to feedback processes that quench star formation and limit the total mass of large galaxies in todays universe. Thus, insufficient understanding of feedback associated with them, in particular of the molecular phase, is one of the greatest shortcomings in our knowledge of galaxy evolution. Outflows associated with galactic winds are fueled by both starbursts and AGN, and the ways in which the two winds differ is unknown and can only be gleaned through observations of both. Modeled after previous successful ALMA observations of a starburst driven wind, with 1.2 hours of ALMA time on source we will observe the AGN driven wind within the central 1.5 of Circinus, the nearest Seyfert galaxy. We will assess the morphology and kinematics of the molecular wind, and estimate the molecular outflow rate.',\n"," 'Nuclear starbursts in the dense molecular torus in NGC 1068. We propose <0.06\" (<4.2 pc) resolution ALMA band 3 observations of nearby type-2 AGN, NGC 1068, at two hydrogen recombination lines in the millimeter wavelength. Our ALMA Cycle-4 data of dense molecular tracers (HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 lines) revealed clearly, for the first time, the long-sought-after rotating dense molecular torus along the east-west direction in NGC 1068, as expected from the widely accepted AGN unification paradigm. However, we also found that the observed torus properties are much more complicated than simple predictions by the paradigm. We aim to test a nuclear starburst scenario as the origin of the observed non-axisymmetric molecular gas properties between the eastern and western part of the torus. Such nuclear starbursts in the torus, if detected clearly in the proposed dust-extinction-free probes, could also explain (1) the observed rotation much slower than the Keplerian motion governed by the central supermassive black hole and (2) high observed AGN luminosity in NGC 1068. Scrutinizing the torus properties in the archetypical nearby AGN, NGC 1068, will be an important milestone toward understanding the role of torus in the AGN population in our universe.',\n"," 'Resolved thermal images of Pluto and Charon. We will use ALMA in configuration C40-9 at 1.1 mm to obtain spatially resolved images of Pluto and Charon individually at thermal wavelengths. ALMA is unique in its ability to produce such images, which will be very powerful tools in understanding the surfaces of Pluto and Charon. Accurate measurements of thermal parameters like emissivity, thermal inertia, and the distribution of surface temperatures will aid in modeling the volatile transport on Pluto, which is key to understanding the evolution of its surface and atmosphere over time. With the recent flyby of New Horizons, we know much more than we did previously about both bodies, but the proposed observations still add unique information which will help understand the two. Data from NH will be critical in our modeling of the thermal emission, and our data will be important in interpreting some NH observations (temperature, albedo, 4.2-cm brightness temperature, etc.). A particular example is the apparent lack of N2 ice/frost in the north polar regions from NH, despite it being predicted to be there by some models. ALMA measurements will be able to resolve the north polar region, and help disentangle this problem.',\n"," '100,000 Molecular Clouds Across the Main Sequence: GMCs as the Drivers of Galaxy Evolution. For 30 years, our observational understanding of extragalactic giant molecular clouds and their star formation has been built on case studies and small galaxy samples. We propose to harness ALMAs stunning survey speed and imaging power to move this field into the era of big surveys. With 75 hours of main array time, we will image CO(2-1) at 1\" resolution across the disks of all 80 massive (log M_star > 9.75 M_sun) star-forming galaxies in the local volume (d<17 Mpc). This will yield >100,000 GMCs spread across a sample of galaxies and environments that is truly representative. Using in-place machinery, we will use these data to measure the key ingredients for a synthetic model of star formation: (1) the molecular cloud population (mass function and dynamical state), (2) the efficiency per free fall time, (3) the cloud lifetime and destruction time, and (4) the scale and mechanism for star formation self-regulation. Measuring these quantities as a function local environment and host galaxy will provide the fundamental link between molecular clouds, star formation, and galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Polarimetric Imaging Observations of the Disk around TW Hya. Obtaining observational constraints of grain size is important in understanding planet formation. We propose to observe the disk around TW Hya in polarized emission in Band 7 in order to obtain direct constraints on grain size. Our near infrared polarized imaging observations have indicated that grain growth takes place in the disk. Most recently, Andrews et al. (2016) have found that the disk harbors several gaps and our ALMA Cycle 3 program has revealed that the dust opacity index increases at the location of one of the gaps, suggesting that the size segregation takes place. Recently, we have suggeted a method of constraining the grain size in the disk by using polarization observations. In the presence of radial structures such as gaps and/or bumps and with the dust particles grown to a certain size, dust continuum emission is expected to be polarized due to the scattering by the dust particles themselves. With its complex radial structures of dust continuum emission, TW Hya is one of the ideal targets that we expect to observe scattering-induced polarization and to be able to put constraints on grain growth.',\n"," 'Spectroscopy of a normal star forming galaxy at z=2 with 200 pc resolution: physical conditions in the cold ISM at high redshift. We propose spatially-resolved observations of the CO(3-2) and [CII] lines and 630 GHz continuum emission in the gravitationally lensed galaxy MACS J0451+0006 (J0451). J0451 is a representative L* star-forming galaxy at z=2.01 magnified by a factor of 49 ensuring that ALMAs resolution (0.6 arcseconds) will correspond to a physical scale of only 200 parsecs in the source plane. Our extensive observations with HST and ground-based laser-assisted adaptive optics have yielded precise physical properties (radius, stellar mass, star formation rate, far-IR luminosity, and metallicity) making it the ideal source for detailed ALMA observations. Via this proposal, which represents a natural extension of that approved for Cycle 0, we aim to characterize the physical conditions, spatial distribution, and kinematics of the cold ISM via resolved observations as well as to compare these with our existing optical and near infrared data. Our specific goals are to (1) determine the physical conditions of the cold ISM in a typical z=2 galaxy; (2) determine the mode of star formation (i.e. extended disk vs. compact central starburst) via the distribution and kinematics of the cold ISM; (3) test whether the ratio of [CII] to far-IR emission on 200 pc scales follows the same trend with star formation density as at z=0, and thus to determine its physical origin; (4) compare the spatial distribution and kinematics of the cold ISM (traced by CO and [CII]) with that of bright star-forming regions (traced by Halpha, UV, and far-IR emission) and hence measure the interaction between star formation and cold gas dynamics. As we argued in our Cycle 0 proposal, our observations will provide the first detailed study of the cold ISM in a typical L* high-redshift galaxy, and the first spatially-resolved data necessary to investigate carefully the mode of star formation. Such an investigation would not be possible without the boost in signal and resolution provided by gravitational lensing. An equivalent program targeting an unlensed source would require several days of integration even with the completed ALMA array. J0451 therefore presents an unique opportunity for ALMA to make dramatic progress in the study of the cold ISM in a typical high-redshift galaxy.',\n"," 'Measuring Molecular Gas in Unseen Galaxies: A Survey of 100,000 Cubic Mpc between z=1-5. Molecular gas is central to the formation of stars in galaxies. However, at high redshift, it has been detected only in the most massive and luminous systems. Sensitivity to low mass systems allows for better exploration of the overall molecular gas abundance, metal production and galaxy evolution within the Universe. We propose to measure the distribution of molecular gas in the early Universe (z>1) using the technique of ``intensity mapping\", with which low and intermediate-mass galaxies are detectable as integrated ensembles. We propose an intensity mapping experiment to measure the broad population of molecular-gas bearing galaxies between z=1-5, utilizing the emission arising from several bright CO rotational transitions. The proposed observations will improve on the sensitivity of present power spectrum measurements by nearly an order of magnitude.',\n"," 'SUPER-ALMA v2: gas fractions and depletion timescales in AGN hosts at z~2. An unbiased study of the gas content of AGN host galaxies is fundamental to: 1) constrain the triggering mechanism of AGN activity; 2) quantify the impact that AGN outflows may have on the gas reservoir of the host. We propose to combine CO(3-2) ALMA observations with our on-going SINFONI/VLT Large Programme (SUPER, 280h) on an unbiased sample of AGN at z~2. While SINFONI allows to map ionised gas kinematics (e.g. [OIII]), the CO(3-2) observations will complete the picture, sampling the molecular gas phase of the interstellar medium. This program has been already awarded time in Cycle-4, and we ask to complete the ALMA follow-up of the full SINFONI sample which is crucial to sample the full range of AGN properties (Lbol, Eddington ratios, presence of outflows and their energetics) to make significant progress in understanding the physical origin of any difference in the gas content of AGN hosts compared to inactive galaxies.',\n"," 'H2S as a tracer of shocks in AGN outflows. There is growing evidence that nuclear activity can power massive molecular outflows. These outflows help regulate the growth of galaxy nuclei and the implied outflow momenta suggest that the inner regions of these galaxies may be cleared of material with in a few Myr. Recent detections of very dense (n>1e4 cm-3) molecular gas in some outflows raises questions on the origin and fate of the dense gas. It has been suggested that it is linked to the presence of internal/external processing shocks in the outflows. These processes are important since they may for example lead to cloud compression and star formation in the outflows. Shocks may also dissipate and decelerate rotation or instabilities in the outflow, or aid in its deceleration. We hereby propose a search for the luminous shock tracer H2S in a small sample of AGN outflows. H2S is an excellent tracer of fast mantle-processing shocks and its abundances can be very high - similar to those of the standard dense gas tracer HCN. We aim to see if shocks are correlated with outflow velocity and type of outflow - ranging from jet driven collimated outflows to wide angle AGN winds.',\n"," 'Caught in the act: H2O masers flaring in a low-mass protostar. Water masers offer the possibility to diagnose gas motions in the disk and outflow of deeply embedded protostars at incredibly high angular precision, even by ALMA standards. Maser monitoring observations show that protostars flare, and the brightness in masers increase many times over periods of just a few months. Thus, masers provide a unique insight into the time variability of deeply embedded protostars. One example of such water maser variability is seen toward the low-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS16293-2422, where the 22 GHz water maser has increased in brightness by a factor of 20 over 2.5 months (mid-March to June, 2018, increase from 240 to 4700 Jy), but only observed with a single dish. We here propose for DDT time to observe this flare with ALMA in the 183 GHz H2O maser line. These observations will: (i) reveal the location of the maser spots irrespective of ALMA configuration; (ii) allow us to infer the gas temperature by comparison to the 22 GHz data; (iii) complement our accepted A-ranked Cycle 5 ALMA proposal nominally to be carried out in September by allowing us to track the flare; and finally (iv) open up a new window for ALMA to track gas dynamics on small scales.',\n"," '[OIII] line kinematics of a Lya emitter at z=7.2. We have detected the [O III] 88 micron line from a z=7.2 LyA emitter (LAE) with a >5sigma significance with ALMA Band~8 observations in Cycle~2. The current data also show marginal (~3sigma) red- and blue-shifted high-velocity components around the line. We here request additional Band~8 observations of the line for the following two aims: (1) to confirm the high-velocity components and (2) to examine whether the components are explained by a rotational motion or outflow/inflow. This program will be the first study of kinematics in LAEs in the reionization epoch, about a decade prior to studies using ultraviolet metal emission lines with ELTs. Since it has turned out that the observing chance for this LAE with a 0.1 spatial resolution is much less in Cycle~4 than in the rest of Cycle~3, we urgently propose this program as a DDT one in Cycle~3.',\n"," 'Metallicity and dust content in J0100+2802, the most massive quasar in the reionization epoch. Having by far the largest black hole mass at high redshift, J0100+2802 at z=6.3 is the best laboratory to study if quasars truly represent the site of the earliest structure formation and chemical evolution. However, the currently available data marginally indicates that J0100+2802 has a dust mass surprisingly as low as a few times 1e+7 Msun, similar to those in normal star-forming galaxies without AGN at a similar epoch. This poses a severe question whether the target is chemically enriched system. The signature of multiple mergers, as revealed by a high-angular resolution image, is consistent with the possibility of lower gas-phase metallicity of the host galaxy than expected. Here we propose to observe four emission lines and Band 9 dust continuum of the target to securely measure the gas-phase metallicity and dust mass. We will test if J0100+2802 truly represents a chemically enriched system or an object with a relatively low metal and dust content. If the former is confirmed, it will evidence that the host galaxy of J0100+2802 is chemically enriched at z ~ 6, and if the latter, this will pose a severe question to the current understanding of the galaxy-BH coevolution.',\n"," 'Unveiling the nature of an unusually large gaseous transit in a debris disk. Debris disks can be seen as the left-overs of the star formation process and the possible nurseries of rocky planets. They were commonly understood as gas depleted but recent gas detections, including our own, challenge this concept. Second generation gas can be produced by collisions of icy bodies or star grazing exocomets and its effect on the dust particles may affect planet formation. We have detected an unusually large CaII absorption in the debris disk HD37306 using high-resolution spectra. We interpret this event as an exocometary transit. These gas absorptions can only be observed if the outgassing event is crossing the line of sight of the star. This method severily limits our chances of further detections and only allows us to partially trace the gas in the system, unlike ALMA observations in emission. As CO is prone to photo-dissociate and thus has a relatively short lifetime, by detecting CO we would confirm that outgassing processes are currently occurring in the disk. We aim to detect CO in Band 8 to confirm the nature of the gas, estimate the gas content and, possibly, be able to resolve this faint debris disk for the first time to directly constrain its orientation.',\n"," 'Multi-wavelength imaging of the possibly planet-induced asymmetries in a pre-transitional disc. Scattered-light imaging of several transitional discs revealed intriguing spiral-arm structures that might be tell-tale signs of planet formation. However, it is not clear whether these structures correspond to significant surface density enhancements, or whether they are minor surface scale-height perturbations. Here we propose Band 7 observations on the pre-transitional disc of V1247Ori, where our recent SEEDS polarimetric imaging revealed an one-armed spiral-arm structure on scales of 200-300mas. As follow-up observations of our Cycle 3 project, our ALMA imaging aims to (a) determine the azimuthal density-contrast in dust continuum, (b) search for streamers and emission from the putative planet, (c) trace gas spatial distribution and kinematics.',\n"," 'Are Planetary Orbits Aligned with Binary Orbits?. We propose ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks in 14 young binary systems, to test whether or not the two disks in a binary system are aligned with each other, and with the binary orbit. ALMA is currently the only way we can measure the three-dimensional orientation of the eventual orbits of planets in these systems; once the disks dissipate and the planets form, their orbits become invisible. The degree of misalignment between binary and planetary orbits has implications for planet migration and orbital evolution as well as for binary formation. In the process of making these measurements, we will test the validity of a previously-used method of measuring disk alignment, which recent ALMA observations have called into question.',\n"," 'Formation of complex organics in solar-type protostars. Understanding how, when and where complex organic and potentially prebiotic molecules are formed is a fundamental goal of astrochemistry and an integral part of origins of life studies. Already now ALMA is showing its capabilities for studies of the chemistry of solar-type stars with its high sensitivity for faint lines, high spectral resolution which limits line confusion, and high angular resolution making it possible to study young stars on solar-system scales. We here propose to undertake an unbiased survey of the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 in the important spectral window from 329 to 363 GHz. The aim is to reveal the origin of complex organic molecules in a young protostellar system and investigate the link between this stage and the early Solar System. These data will however also have a large legacy value beyond the astrochemical focus of our group and we will therefore waive the proprietary period for the obtained data - and furthermore make the fully imaged datacubes available to the community with the first sets of papers.',\n"," 'Confirmation and structure of HCOOH toward the TW Hydrae protoplanetary disk. One of the most important questions of astrochemistry is how, when and where organic molecules and potentially prebiotic molecules are formed and could this have a bearing on the origin of life on Earth? In that context, we are focussing on the formic acid (HCOOH), that is a precursor of larger carboxilic acids, including potentially prebiotic molecules. From ALMA-Cycle 3 data, we have strong hints of its detection in the TW HYa protoplanetary disks. In the proposed observations, we intend to confirm it detection and determine its excitation properties.',\n"," 'Molecular gas and star formation in normal galaxies at z=1.47-2.23. We propose to observe the global molecular gas content in a sample of four normal (main sequence) star-forming galaxies taken from the COSMOS and UDS fields at z=1.47 and 2.23, respectively. The targets are taken from the HiZELS survey and have exquisite multi-wavelength coverage, including VLT/SINFONI or Gemini-N/NIFS IFU AO-aided maging at ~0.15\" of the Halpha emission line, probing the kinematical details of the ionised gas: mergers or thick-disk clumpy galaxies. The targets are representative to the bulk of the high-z galaxies, and measuring their molecular gas content (M_H2) provides a unique way for estimating their evolutionary state in the Universe. In particular, we use band-3 to detect at ~2\" the CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) emission line for galaxies at z=1.47 and 2.23, respectively, allowing a global estimate of M_H2, depletion times via M_H2/SFR and gas fractions, in comparison to similar quiescent star-forming galaxies seen locally. The proposed four galaxies will double the number of HiZELS galaxies with CO detections at z>1.',\n"," '[CI] observations of the Magellanic Supernova Remnant N49. Atomic carbon line emission (CI) is thought to be a powerful tool for deducing the H2 distribution in galaxies and one that can be as reliable as low-J CO line emission. However, it is not fully understand how the [CI]/[CO] abundance ratio is modified under the environment where cosmic-ray induced and/or shock destructions of CO molecules occur efficiently. We here propose to observe [CI] 3P1-3P0 line emission toward molecular clouds interacting with the Magellanic supernova remnant N49. The edge-on viewed CO clouds revealed by previous ALMA observations provide the best laboratory to investigate variations of [CI]/[CO] through the cosmic-ray induced / shock destructions of CO without any contamination along the line of sight. In short, [CI]/[CO] enhancements via the shock destructions can be seen only inside the SNR boundary, whereas cosmic-ray induced destructions will affect whole the clouds owing to their energy dependent diffusions. The proposed ALMA ACA Band 8 observations at a resolution of ~3 arcsec or ~0.8 pc will allow us to study the spatial variations of [CI]/[CO] in the molecular clouds interacting with the Magellanic supernova remnant for the first time.',\n"," 'Massive CO-rich Comet Clouds Around Youthful Main Sequence Stars. Dusty debris disks are known around hundreds of main sequence stars with ages of 30 Myr or greater but, among these, associated gas (carbon monoxide) has been detected with radio telescopes in the vicinity of only two A-type stars. Given the short lifetime (~500 yr) of a CO molecule in stellar and interstellar radiation fields, even two such detections are difficult to explain. We propose a search for CO in a carefully selected sample of 10 dusty debris disks. Discovery with ALMA of additional examples of disks that contain CO should confirm or deny the plausible hypothesis that the CO is generated via very frequent collisions of comets rich in CO and CO2 in regions analogous to the Suns Kuiper Belt but containing a total cometary mass equal to hundreds of Earth masses.',\n"," 'The role of magnetic fields in the formation of young massive clusters. We want to establish the role of the magnetic field (B-field) in the formation of young massive clusters (YMCs). YMCs are gravitationally-bound stellar systems with masses and densities orders of magnitude larger than typical open clusters, but comparable to those in globular clusters and extragalactic super star clusters. Out of the very few YMC progenitor candidates known to date, SgrB2(N) stands out as the only YMC in the making. Previous ALMA observations have characterized its mass distribution, fragmentation, turbulence and accretion. We now aim at studying its B-field properties in relation to the existing dense filamentary network that accretes mass at high rates. With ALMA band 6 polarimetric observations, we will study the B-field morphology and determine its role in the stability and fragmentation of the filaments. By determining the B-field strength, we will estimate the energy balance between gravity, magnetic and kinetic energies, and examine whether the outer region of the filamentary network is subcritical, becoming supercritical at the center where most gas and stars accumulate. This will be the first detailed study of the B-field in the well-known region SgrB2(N).',\n"," 'ALMA Identification of Submillimeter Galaxies along QSO Sightlines. Submillimeter Galaxies (SMGs) are the most likely progenitors of modern massive elliptical galaxies. Their clustering strength indicates that they inhabit massive (~1e13 Msun) halos at z ~ 2.5. Current theories predict that the majority of gas accreted by such halos should be shock-heated to temperatures ~ 10 million K. Furthermore, one predicts that this hot plasma cools too slow to sustain the extreme star formation rates of SMGs. So how do the SMGs acquire their massive reservoirs of cold gas and will their current starbursts lead to rapid quenching? To resolve these outstanding questions, we have started a program to use QSO absorption line spectroscopy to probe the circum-galactic medium of SMGs. The proposed ALMA band-7 snapshots is critical to this program. We aim at determining sub-arcsecond positions of a sample of 30 SMGs that lie within 30 arcsec of a high-redshift QSO sightline to allow future spectroscopy. This is currently impossible because the position uncertainties of the SMGs from far-IR imaging is ~5 arcsec in radius.',\n"," 'How does CO trace the HI-to-H2 Transition at Low Metallicity?. A key remaining question in star formation and galaxy evolution is how the atomic gas transitions to molecular, and in particular, the effect of metallicity on this process. We propose to look for faint CO emission using the ACA in standalone mode towards a sample of sources spread across the Magellanic Clouds that have HI absortion observations as part of an ongoing large ATCA project lead by Co-I McClure-Griffiths. We will be able to compare the CO intensity to the HI spin temperature and fraction of cold neutral gas to constrain how metallicity affects the transition from molecular to atomic gas. By revealing how much CO emission exists along these lines of sight and comparing to the optical depth of HI determined from the absorption line measurements, we will constrain how much optically thick HI gas contributes to the \"CO-dark\" or \"CO-faint\" gas component at low metallicity. With the proposed ~80 single-pointings towards the background continuum sources with HI absorption measurements, we are in a unique position to study how environment affects the CO emission and its connection to the HI-to-H2 transition.',\n"," 'An Unprecedented Census of the Molecular ISM in Starburst Galaxies at the End of Cosmic Reionization. We propose a full molecular line inventory in Bands 3 and 4 of four of the highest known redshift dusty starburst galaxies accessible by ALMA, at z~5.7, close to the end of cosmic reionization. Our previous ALMA spectroscopy in two DSFGs at similar redshifts, show striking results, anticipating a new era for molecular ISM studies in high-z galaxies. We expect to detect more than 40 lines of 13 molecular species in each object, tracing the full range of excitation conditions, heating mechanisms, outflow and dynamical signatures, and chemical enrichment pathways. At these rest frequencies, our observations will match and even exceed the sensitivity of local starbursts observed by Herschel/SPIRE. By exploiting high-resolution ALMA 870um continuum observations, low- and mid-J CO observations with ATCA and ALMA, [CII] emission from APEX, and full optical-to-radio SED coverage, these observations will stand as the definitive view of the ISM conditions in these objects, serving as an effective comparative study to local starbursts (e.g. Arp220) and intermediate-redshift analog systems (e.g. the Eyelash).',\n"," 'ACA Monitoring of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) targets during the April 2023 EHT Campaign. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations will be carried out in Cycle 9, with the aim of resolving black hole shadows and jet launching regions in AGNs. These are expected to be observed over a 12-day period in March-April 2023, using several ~5-15 hr observing runs, triggered based on weather and telescope readiness, i.e. individual sources will be observed over several days with unpredictable gaps in daily coverage. Here, we propose daily ACA monitoring of four sources: SgrA*, M87, 3C279, and CenA - during the 2023 EHT campaign. The primary goals of this proposal are to obtain: (a) better than 10% absolute flux calibration (per daily epoch) for all sources in the EHT observing runs (via bootstrapping); (b) constrain the origin of variability (e.g. proper motions vs relative brightening of individual components, or hot-spot orbits in Sgr A*) seen in EHT images on individual days using the argument of spectral variability; (c) a better comparison with the multi-wavelength (cm to X-ray) campaign (EHT private communication). Overall, these observations will lead to a significantly better, and perhaps crucial, understanding of the physical mechanisms on event horizon scales.',\n"," 'Does a bright SMG have a giant rotating gas disk?. Submillimeter bright galaxies (SMGs) are gas and dust-rich, massive galaxies and of importance as progenitors of massive early type galaxies in the local universe. Recently we discovered a bright SMG (SFR~2000 Msun/yr) with very extended molecular gas disk (40 kpc), which resides in a z=3.09 proto-cluster core. The current 0.8 arcsec mapping uncovered overall velocity gradient, which appears to be unusual giant, rapid rotating disk. But the apparent velocity gradient may be from major-merger at the current spatial resolution. Here we propose 0.2 arcsec mapping of CO(3-2) line from the SMG to finally unlock the gas dynamics and distributions. We will also observe other 3 z=3.09 SMGs in the same FoV and compare the gas properties with the giant, extended SMG, utilizing the ALMA time effectively. Thus this band-3 observation will uncover the fueling mechanism of multiple SMGs at the proto-cluster core, where the ancestors of massive ellipticals were assembling the stellar mass rapidly.',\n"," 'Chemical evolution during the disk life cycle. The volatile compositions of planets, including water and organic reservoirs, are set by ice and gas compositions in protoplanetary disks. These compositions evolve with time due to a combination of time dependent chemistry and sequential lock-up of elements into icy boulders. As a consequence, the division of O, C and N between ice and gas may change dramatically between disk formation in embedded protostars and the time of disk gas dispersal ~5Myrs later. We propose to explore the time dependent disk chemistry, including the sequential removal of O, C, and N from the gas, through a systematic survey of O, C and N bearing molecules in 15 disks of different ages. The disk sample is drawn from nearby star forming regions Serpens, Taurus and Upper Sco, and contain protostellar disks, young and old protoplanetary disks. The survey will directly address the prevalence of substantial volatile depletion during planet formation, and at what timescales different elements are sequestered out of the gas-phase and into icy solids. The survey will thus provide initial conditions for planet formation throughout the lifetimes of protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'From Dust till Dark: Dissecting SMM J0658 the brightest strongly lensed galaxy behind the Bullet Cluster. We propose to observe SMM J0658 ($z=2.7793\\\\pm1\\\\times10^{-4}$) the brightest lensed galaxy behind the Bullet Cluster. The exceptional lensing circumstances (that cause this source to split into three distinct images with a total magnification of about 100), together with the superb angular resolution and sensitivity of ALMA makes it possible to probe the conditions of the neutral ISM in a LIRG with a mass similar to that of the Milky Way. For this aim, we have improved over the Bullet Cluster lens modeling to account for differential magnification in the combined analysis of the proposed observations along with our published CO(10) observations in the modeling of the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED). SMM J0658 is the lowest mass galaxy at $z\\\\sim2.5$ where such detailed analysis is allowed. Therefore, the proposed observations are key to understand star formation in the most common galaxy population at $z>1$.',\n"," 'Understanding the nature of the ULIRG population in massive clusters at z ~ 1-1.5. Mid/far-infrared and submillimeter surveys of z~1-1.5 clusters have found apparent over-densities of dust-obscured, but strongly star-forming galaxies within some cluster cores. We have completed a 870um survey of ten massive z~1-1.5 clusters with SCUBA-2 finding a wide range of activity within their cores. Using ALMA to map an over-density of four SCUBA-2 submm sources in the core of a z=1.46 cluster we resolved this emission into fourteen distinct 1mm continuum sources (each possessing ULIRG-like luminosities) and simultaneously confirmed five of these as cluster members from CO(5-4) emission. We propose to use ALMA to measure the dust continuum and search for CO(5-4) line emission for ULIRGs in the central 3 Mpc of two other active clusters from our survey: RX J0152 and XDCP J0044. Using this data to examine the dynamics, molecular gas mass, star formation efficiency, and dust to gas ratio of these cluster ULIRGs to compare them to similarly luminous systems in the field and test their connection to potential descendant populations of elliptical and S0 galaxies in clusters today.',\n"," 'Protolunar disks around directly imaged young exoplanets. The gas giant planets of the Solar System are surrounded by moons in large quantities, with at least 50 prograde moons thought to have formed in situ. Just like the Sun is not the only star surrounded by planets, it is very likely that extrasolar gas giant planets are also surrounded by lunar systems. Building on the properties of the solar system regular satellites, we derive models for minimum-mass protolunar disks. Using 3D radiative transfer, we show that such late circumplanetary debris disks would be readily observable given the incident flux from the central host star, and are even brighter when heated from the still-warm giant companion they are surrounding. We propose to test our predictions by observing three confirmed companions around nearby (50 pc) young (<30 Myr) stars with ALMA in Band 6 continuum and 12CO J=2-1 at 0.1 resolution. We are resubmitting our ongoing Cycle 3 program for PZ Tel and AB Pic (cat. B), and adding 51 Eri. Given our simulations, protolunar disks around these companions should be detectable at 10 sigma with just a few minutes (7-17 min) on source. Our science requires only 1 hr per target including calibrations.',\n"," 'The Fine Structure of an Extreme, Lensed Starburst Galaxy at z=5.7. We propose to observe a full diagnostic suite of five far-IR fine structure lines in an extraordinary starburst galaxy at the end of cosmic reionization. Through the power of gravitational lensing, our observations will measure the metallicity, radiation field, density, kinematics, and AGN effects with effective resolution of a few hundred parsecs, which has only been possible to date in the nearest star-forming galaxies. SPT0346-52, at z=5.7, already has high-resolution maps of the dust continuum and low-J CO emission, as well as integrated measurements of mid-J CO, [CII], and full radio-to-IR SED coverage. These observations effectively complement Herschel studies of local ULIRGs, and extend the study of these lines to the first Gyr of cosmic history. The high sensitivity, high resolution studies made possible by ALMA will address several key questions about the first stages of galaxy evolution, including the production of heavy elements, stellar and AGN feedback mechanisms, the energetics of the ISM, and the dynamics of the first galaxies.',\n"," 'A [CI] survey of high-redshift main-sequence galaxies. State-of-the-art modeling shows that the atomic carbon line [CI](1-0) is a much better tracer of gas mass (Mgas) than CO(1-0) and [CII], being almost insensitive to density and radiation field variations. However, the only objects currently detected in [CI] at high-redshift are lensed starbursting sub-mm galaxies and quasars, completely missing the bulk of the normal main-sequence (MS) population. To fill this gap, we ask for 8h of ALMA time to follow-up [CI](1-0) in ~50 MS galaxies at z=1.2. Observations in [CI](2-1) are requested for a subsample of 8 targets. The combination of [CI](1-0) and (2-1), continuum emission at 500 mum rest-frame (a bonus from our observations), COSMOSs excellent photometric and IR coverage, spectroscopic redshifts, and in-hand CO(5-4) observations will allow us to securely estimate gas masses and fractions (Mgas, fgas), the excitation conditions of the ISM (from the [CI](2-1)/(1-0) ratio), star-formation rates, and stellar masses. Comparison with totally independent estimates of Mgas from CO and dust emission will provide crucial insight into the highly disputed evolution of fgas and star formation efficiencies with redshift, along and off the MS.',\n"," 'Cold Gas Around Black Holes: Fueling and Feedback in Galaxy Mergers. We propose to obtain very long baseline observations of CO(2-1) to measure the distribution and kinematics of cold molecular gas in the central few hundred parsecs of two outflow host galaxies, IRAS F17207-0014 and IIIZw035. Our adaptive optics integral field spectroscopy has identified two key features within the nuclei of these galaxies: collimated warm molecular outflows and central dynamical masses 3-30 times larger than those predicted by black hole scaling relations. Only ALMA can provide the resolution-matched molecular gas observations needed to measure the temperature distributions and mass-loading factors of these confirmed nuclear outflows, a fundamental question regarding central engine feedback in galaxy evolution. The large central dynamical masses measured from our AO observations may be identifying a large mass of gas that will eventually fuel the black hole or be entrained in a molecular outflow. Our proposed observations will therefore either confirm some of the most extreme black hole scaling relation offsets or identify systems poised to undergo a massive central AGN accretion or starburst event.',\n"," 'A comprehensive study of the interstellar medium 830 Myr after the Big Bang. We propose a comprehensive study of the physics of the interstellar medium in a luminous QSO recently discovered by our group at z=6.4, i.e., 830 Myr after the Big Bang. This study is motivated by a strong [CII] line detection that allows us to predict relatively strong line emission for 13 molecular and 4 fine-structure lines that, fortuitously at this redshift, are observable with ALMA. With only 6 frequency settings, we will target 17 lines tracing the ionized, neutral, and molecular gas in this star-forming galaxy. Including the already secured very bright [CII] line, these observations will constrain key physical properties of the gas at the dawn of galaxy formation, such as density, temparature, metallicity, ionization degree, and hardness of the radiation field. The selected bright QSO at z=6.4 therefore provides us with a unique opportunity to investigate the physics of the interstellar medium at the formation of todays massive quiescent galaxies.',\n"," 'Rotating hot cores confining hyper-compact HII regions. Almost half of the mass of O-type stars is accreted after reaching the main sequence, when they are already producing vast amounts of UV photons. How high-mass stars keep accreting despite the onset of the ionizing radiation is not well established. A compelling possibility is that the inflow direction is perpendicular to the angular momentum of the rotating core, and that the first stage of development of an HII region, the hypercompact (HC), consist of an ionized biconical cavity confined by a rotating and contracting molecular core. We propose to use the ALMA to test a key prediction of this hypothesis, which is that all HC HII regions should be associated with a rotating hot molecular core. We target five luminous young high-mass stars associated with HC HII regions looking for velocity gradients consistent with a rotating core on scales 3000 AU using high-energy transitions of SO2 and CH3CN. We also observe the ionized gas emission traced by the H29 recombination line. The common presence of rotating cores around HC HII regions will help us to confirm the hypotheses of this simple model.',\n"," 'Stars or Black Holes? What mechanisms cause the rapid shutdown of star formation at the end of a burst?. Both AGN and stellar feedback have been invoked for driving galaxies from star-forming to quiescent. The evolution of the molecular gas immediately after a starburst has ended can constrain the physical mechanisms that have acted. Recent work has uncovered surprising trends in the gas state of recently quenched galaxies. Despite their low star formation rates, post-starburst galaxies retain large CO-traced molecular gas reservoirs. Furthermore, the CO-traced gas declines throughout the post-starburst phase, well after star formation has ended. Tentative evidence shows that the *dense* molecular gas may be depleted early in the post-starburst phase, suggesting stellar feedback may end starbursts by disrupting the dense gas clouds that would otherwise continue to form stars. We propose to measure the dense molecular gas fraction using the HCO+(1-0)/CO(1-0) fraction in a sample of five young post-starburst galaxies. These observations will test whether the galaxies have experienced rapid dense gas depletion from stellar feedback early in the post-starburst phase or whether the dense gas is depleted alongside the CO-traced gas throughout the post-starburst phase due to AGN feedback.',\n"," 'The molecular gas in low-redshift SMGs. Galaxies selected by their 850-mum emission remain the best studied submm galaxies (SMGs). SMGs represent a very important galaxy population, since they contribute ~30% to the cosmic star formation at z~2 and provide key constraints in models of galaxy formation and evolution. However, due to their faintness and small sizes -caused by a combination of their distance and their extremely dusty nature- a detailed multi-wavelength analysis of their properties is challenging even with the most powerful current instrumentation. As proven for other populations of star-forming galaxies, low-z analogs can be used to understand and interpret the properties of galaxies in the high-redshift Universe. Using the wide H-ATLAS survey we have isolated a robust sample of 44 low-redshift (zspec < 0.5) SMGs based on their dust temperatures and IR luminosities. We propose to finish the 12CO(3-2) ACA observations of our full sample of low-redshift SMGs (ongoing in Cycle 5, but only nine have been observed so far) to measure the properties of their molecular gas.',\n"," 'The first observation of coronal radio emission from narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. We challenge to detect the synchrotron radio emission from coronae above accretion disks in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) for the first time. Although the coronal emission of AGNs had never been detected in radio wavelengths, we have successfully detected the nonthermal component of AGN coronal radio emission for the first time by our previous ALMA observations (Cycle 4) of Type-1 Seyfert galaxies, IC 4329A and NGC 985 with relatively low accretion rates. As a next step, we unveil the nature of the coronae in the NLS1 class with high accretion rates for the first time, by simple point-source photometry at Band 3, 4, and 6. Why do we need ALMA?: Coronal radio emission is expected to show a continuum spectrum peaked at millimeter wavelengths due to strong synchrotron self-absorption. Based on the radio/X-ray flux ratio, expected flux densities are a few mJy levels even for the brightest three NLS1s. To avoid dust contamination, high angular resolutions are required.',\n"," 'Accretion shocks and streamers shaping two disks in formation. We propose to observe the planet-forming region of the binary system SVS13-A at a spatial resolution of ~30 au, sufficient to clearly separate the two protostars, and in ALMA Band 3 to minimise dust opacity effects. The two main goals of the proposal are: 1) to unveil the nature of the streamers and accretion shocks suggested by previous ALMA observations and 2) to understand the role of accretion shocks in the chemical enrichment. We will use, in a single spectral setup, bright gas tracers to investigate the cold gas in the streamers (13CO, C18O, CS), the accretion shock (SO, OCS, CH3OH) and the disks region (CH3OH, 13CH3OH, CH3CN). Only ALMA can provide the combination of high-angular resolution and sensitivity to observe the molecular gas at a 30 au scale at 3mm, where the dust is optically thin. The project will shed light on the role that streamers and accretion shocks have on disk formation and chemical enrichment.',\n"," 'Millimeter line variability in IRC +10216 with ALMA Compact Array.. The pulsation process is the key to understanding AGB wind launching but is difficult to observe. Recently, line variability was found at mm wavelengths and part of which could be due to the pulsation dynamics in the inner circumstellar envelope. This offers the possibility to trace the elusive dynamical processes with monitoring at mm wavelengths. We performed a systematic single dish monitoring of several millimeter lines toward the archetypal carbon star IRC +10216. Regular line intensity and line shape variations were found. Although we found phase shifts in the line variability pattens, they are not well understood. Our Cycle-4 ACA monitoring project is already running to confirm these mm variability features and a Cycle-5 project has also been proposed to extend the monitoring and upgrade it to a higher cadence of once a month to better investigate their dynamical origin. Hereby we propose to improve the running Cycle-4 project by upgrading it also to a higher monitoring cadence of once a month. This will make up the lost epoch and improve the science output of the entire monitoring project.',\n"," 'The 12C/13C Isotopic Ratio in Protoplanetary Disks. We propose to obtain a direct meaurement of the 12C/13C and the 16O/18O isotopic ratios in two protoplanetary disk systems. Isotopic ratios are key quantities to extract physical (mass) and chemical (abundances) properties. Measurements of the the isotopic ratio in the bulk material also enable studies of the effects of isotopic fractionation such as that seen in galactic photodissociation regions which are direct analogs to the irradiated surfaces of disks. In disks the effects of isotopic self shielding are theorized to be the main mechanism for creating one of the more puzzling aspects of the solar system chemical record: the 18O enrichement (relative to 16O) in chondritic meteorites. Building upon techniques developed to characterize this ratio in the ISM we will obtain simultaneous measurements of 12C18O and 13C18O J = 3--2 transition in TW Hya and DM Tau. This simple meaurement can provide a direct estimate of the 12C/13C ratio. Simultaneous observations of 13CO J = 3-2 then can be used to determine the ratio of 16O/18O and test the process of isotopic self-shielding in the disk ennvironment for the first time with resolved observations.',\n"," 'ACA CO(1-0) mapping of Stephans Quintet. Compact galaxy groups offer a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of galaxy harassment and interaction on gas dynamics and star formation (SF) in a dense environment. Stephans Quintet (SQ; 89 Mpc) is a well-known compact galaxy group and a natural laboratory to investigate the process of the removal of gas from galaxies and the triggering of SF in this gas because group members are HI deficit and many inter-galactic SF regions are observed. However, although multi-phase gas data (e.g., HI, warm H2, ionized gas, and hot plasma) are available, a CO map across the entire group is currently lacking. Thus, we propose high accuracy ACA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) mapping across the entire group to completely characterize the spatial distribution and velocity structures of molecular gas in the SQ. Making maps of SF efficiency (SFE) and the ratios of various gas phases, we will reveal the impact of galaxy interaction on the SFE in the member galaxies, the relationship among the HI, molecular gas, and SF in the tidal tail, and the molecular gas formation process and required physical conditions of the gas to induce SF in collisional shock front.',\n"," 'Constraining the sulphur chemistry through observations, lab experiments, and models. Sulphur is one of the most abundant elements of the interstellar medium, and it is also one of the elements where the chemistry is the least understood. This means that although we can readily observe S-bearing molecules in practically every type of environment, we do not know enough that we can use the chemistry to inform us about the physical conditions. To remedy this, we here propose to observe eight different S-bearing molecules toward a shock position in BHR71, a source where atomic S is bright and where we have a chance to obtain a complete inventory of sulphur compounds. A shock position is in many ways the ideal laboratory to study the sulphur-chemistry, because species otherwise locked up on grain surfaces are liberated and observable in the gas phase. To understand the observations, we are carrying out state-of-the-art laboratory experiments. The results of these experiments are incorporated into sophisticated shock models. This unique approach puts us in an ideal position to finally start understanding the sulphur-chemistry in the ISM.',\n"," 'Revealing the Shock-Interacting Molecular Gas toward the Magellanic Superbubble 30 Doradus C. Supernovae (SNe) have profound influence on the evolution of the ISM, high-energy emission, and efficient acceleration of relativistic particles via shock interaction with ambient interstellar gas. 30 Dor C is a unique remnant of multiple SNe so called superbubble in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is known as a bright synchrotron X-ray and TeV gamma-ray emitter. Most recently, we found interacting molecular gas using the Mopra 22-m radio telescope in the 12CO J=1-0 emission line. We could not reveal the detailed structures and the physical conditions because of the poor spatial resolution incapable of resolving the expected clumps. We propose to observe the northwest of 30 Dor C where X-ray is the brightest containing young remnant of SN in the 12CO(J=1-0) line by ALMA in order to resolve the giant molecular cloud into clumps and determine their physical properties interacting with multiple shockwaves. ALMAs unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution will allow us to study in detail the CO gas interacting with the \"extragalactic superbubble\" for the first time.',\n"," 'Chemical Diagnostics of Star Formation in the Bar of NGC 2903. How does the dynamics of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of galaxy affect star formation? This is longstanding issues in the star formation study of nearby galaxy. A barred spiral galaxy is one of the best target to tackle the issues, because of characteristic gas motion in the bar. In the nearby barred galaxy NGC 2903, molecular clouds show weak star formation activities in the bar-end, which is connection point of the bar and spiral arm, although many barred spiral galaxies have active star formation in there. The difference would be attributed to gas dynamics, evolutionary stage of molecular cloud, or buried star formation in optically thick dust. In order to explore these possibilities, we propose multi-molecular line observation including shock, PDR, and dense gas tracers with ALMA in the 3 mm band at a scale of 65 pc. By using chemical compositions of molecular clouds as diagnostics tools, we will assess the environment of molecular cloud such as shock, PDR, and fraction of dense gas. This observation will provide us with an important clue to understand the effect of gas dynamics and shock on the star-formation in the barred galaxy.',\n"," 'From cores to Brown Dwarfs: Unraveling the substellar formation mechanism in Lupus 4. The primary mechanism of formation of brown dwarfs (BDs) is still under debate. Systematic studies in nearby molecular clouds are needed to shed light on how these objects form and so far only a few pre- and proto-BDs candidates have been reported in the literature. Lupus 4 is an excellent laboratory to study the formation of substellar objects. We have identified a set of pre- and proto-substellar candidates using 1.1 mm ASTE/AzTEC maps and analyzing its SED using optical to submillimeter database. We propose ALMA continuum observations at 1.3 mm using 0.6\"-1.0\" spatial resolution towards those promising pre- and proto-brown dwarfs candidates found in Lupus 4. Our main aim is to characterize the dust/envelope/disk surrounding these sub-stellar objects and to compare their properties with the ones from low-mass protostars and with theoretical models that predict the formation of BDs. As a secondary goal we will study the gas emission surrounding these objects. This proposal, requesting 8.15 hours, will enlarge the census of very young BDs an will privide important insights on their formation',\n"," 'Probing the AGN activity and molecular interstellar medium in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies using CH. The goal of this proposal is to establish the CH/CO line ratio as a discriminator between AGN and star-formation dominated galaxies by observing CH (at 560 microns) and CO (J=1-0) in five ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, with and without AGN, at z ~ 0.1. In a small sample of local galaxies observed with the Herschel Space Observatory, we found that the CH/CO abundance ratio is almost an order of magnitude higher in an AGN-dominated galaxy (NGC 1068) compared to three starburst -dominated galaxies (Arp 220, M 82 and NGC 253). This is consistent with the higher abundance of CH expected in X-ray dominated regions, fueled by the presence of the AGN. In addition, estimation of the molecular hydrogen column densities from CH and CO will enable us to test whether the CH is coming from diffuse or dense gas, and thus its reliability as a mass tracer. With the end of the Herschel mission, observations of far-infared CH lines are impossible in nearby galaxies because of atmospheric water vapor. Band-8 of ALMA can detect these lines for galaxies at z > 0.08, the lowest possible redshift for which such a study can be performed.',\n"," 'Constraining the dust-to-gas mass ratio in planet-forming disks. The dust-to-gas mass ratio in young (1-10 Myr) circumstellar disks is a key quantity as it regulates what planets can form and how long disks survive. Yet, it remains poorly constrained. The finding that many such disks have weaker than expected CO emission has recently led to two main hypothesis: A) significant disk gas has been dispersed, hence the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much larger than the ISM value or B) the dust-to-gas mass ratio is still close to the ISM value but CO is not a good tracer of the gas mass. We propose to use the ACA to detect atomic carbon via the [CI] 1-0 line at 492GHz and discriminate between these two hypothesis. Atomic carbon traces the surface of circumstellar disks and its amount is rather insensitive to the gas density, temperature, and UV flux while being very sensitive to the dust-to-gas mass ratio. With a disk sample covering more than an order of magnitude in dust disk masses, we expect to find an anti-correlation between dust disk mass and CI emission if scenario A is correct, no correlation for scenario B. These observations will form the basis for future observations to characterize the spatial extent and kinematics of atomic carbon.',\n"," 'Needles in the Cosmic Haystack - A Hunt for Massive Starless Cores. Massive star formation remains an important unsolved problem in astrophysics. Better observational constraints on its initial conditions are needed. Very few good examples of massive starless cores are known that are on the verge of star formation, i.e. scaled-up versions of highly-deuterated, centrally-concentrated low-mass pre-stellar cores. After searching four infrared dark cloud (IRDC) clumps with ALMA in Cycle 0, we detected one bona fide example in N2D+(3-2) (Tan et al. 2013). The source, C1-South, has a booming signal in this emission line. Here we propose an efficient survey of 32 more IRDC clumps to find more massive starless cores: we expect this will yield a sample of about 10 such cores, the beginnings of a statistical sample.',\n"," 'Probing the dense gas with HCN(5-4) in four SPT lensed dusty star-forming galaxies at 2.5<z<4. The prodigious star formation rates observed in dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshifts require the presence of significant amounts of dense (>10^5 cm^-3) molecular gas. It is not known, however, whether this is due to such systems simply having very large overall molecular gas masses, or whether in fact their dense gas mass fractions are unusually large. Here we therefore propose to observe the HCN(5-4) transition -- a bona fide tracer of the cold and dense gas associated with star forming cores -- towards five lensed DSFGs at z=2.5-4.0, selected from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) sample. The sources were selected so as to have existing observations (CO(2-1), CO(4-3), CO(7-6), [CI](1-0), [CI](2-1), [CII]). With these data, we will: 1) infer the relationship between dense gas and star formation, as traced by HCN(5-4) and IR luminosity, in extreme starburst at high redshifts. 2) compare HCN with other tracers ([CI], CO) to determine the density distribution of the gas; 3) check the concomitance between dense and diffuse gas in our targets; 4) search for additional dense gas tracers (HNC(5-4), CN(4-3), HCO+(5-4), CS(8-7)) in the same spectral windows.',\n"," 'Cold Molecular Gas in Massive Clusters of Galaxies at z>0.3. The cores of clusters of galaxies with the most rapidly cooling intracluster medium on scales of <100kpc all have a massive galaxy at the focus of this intense X-ray emission that shows strong star-formation, extended optical line emission, enhanced AGN activity and cold molecular gas. We propose Morita Array observations of 11 of the most striking examples of these systems at z>0.3 that currently lack any constraints on their CO emission (where currently we have just 3 detections). Any significant subset of these targets would allow us constrain the evolution of these most extreme cluster cores compared to the 12-20 comparable systems known at z<0.3. These observations are ideal fillers and require just a single visit to complete.',\n"," 'The Role and Origin of Dust in a Feedback-Induced BCG Starburst. We propose to acquire spatially resolved imaging with ALMA of the dust continuum in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the galaxy cluster MACS1931.8-2635, to a depth of 0.044 mJy using a combination of observations in bands 6 and 7. These ALMA observations will, for the first time, map both gas and dust at 0.6\" (3 kpc) scales in conjunction with acquired and pending CO(1-0) data, comparable to the size scales of the UV-bright star forming knots and dust lane width in this system. With these data, we will determine the sources, and distribution mechanisms, of dust in cooled gas in this BCG, characterize the interaction between dust and molecular gas flows detected in this system, and constrain the role of dust as a catalyst for star formation and intra-cluster medium cooling. By combining this unique ALMA observation with our Cycle 4 observation of CO and with deep observations from HST, Spitzer, Herschel, Chandra, and archival MUSE IFU data, we will complete a comprehensive study of the multi-phase medium in MACS1931 that will answer unsolved questions about the origin of dust in cool core BCGs and the role of gas physics in AGN-regulated feedback and star formation.',\n"," 'Resolving the dynamical link of the eccentric stars in the massive AK Sco system and the hole in its circumbinary disk. Binary stars will often incite dynamical perturbations in their circumbinary disk, such as clearing, warping, and induced eccentricties of planetesimals. In spite of this apparently hostile environment, the Kepler mission has demonstrated that circumbinary planets form readily. The AK Sco system provides an ideal laboratory to study this environment directly, since its advanced age (18 Myr) has provided plenty of time for the processes of planet formation to sculpt the disk. Recent scattered light observations of AK Sco revealed sharp asymmetric features, which are likely the inner edge of a 30 AU diameter dust ring sculpted by the orbit of a giant planet. We propose high resolution (0.1\") observations of the dust and gas of AK Sco to directly study this exciting dynamical environment. Dust continuum observations will clearly resolve the cavity seen in scattered light and measure the size of the dust ring, probing the effects of planetary sculpting in circumbinary systems. Dynamical modeling of the gas will precisely measure the inclination and eccentricity of the disk, constraining the influence of the eccentric binary on the structure and dynamics of the protoplanetary disk.',\n"," 'Scrutinizing the dust-formation region in AGB stars with ALMA and SPHERE. We will study the mass-loss process experienced by low- and intermediate-mass stars at the end of their lives using quasi-simultaneous ALMA and SPHERE observations of a small sample of AGB stars. These data will spatially resolve the crucial dust-formation region at visible and sub-mm wavelengths, providing crucial constraints for our understanding. While the SPHERE images of polarised light will reveal the distribution of the dust grains that drive the outflow, the ALMA observations will probe the gas properties that allow dust to nucleate and growth. Our strategy builds on previous observations of this type to better constrain the gas density and temperature distributions. Specifically, we aim to obtain an accurate picture of the gas temperature in the innermost regions because recent results reveal a steeper temperature profile than expected. The degree of variation of the gas density and temperature as a function of position, and the correlation between these two quantities will be directly compared to state-of-the-art 3D hydrodynamical codes. In this way, we will test the assumptions and validity of predictions from such theoretical models in an unprecedented way.',\n"," 'Extremely high velocity jets from massive YSOs. Simulations of massive star formation show that outflows are fundamental for the formation of massive stars as they enable accretion to proceed up to stellar masses as large as 140 Msun. In low-mass star formation, models predict disk-mediated accretion and ejection of a collimated jet accelerated by the magnetic field. The jet produces a thin outflow which clears the surrounding dense gas and produces density-enhanced cavity walls. This is well supported by observations which show a defined kinematical pattern in jet/outflow systems: a collimated jet at extremely high-velocity surrounded by low-velocity cavity walls. Collimated jets have never been seen in YSOs with L>10^4 Lsun although models predict their presence up to masses of 30-35 Msun. We propose to observe a complete sample of massive YSOs from the ATLASGAL Top100 sample to search for jet/outflow-cavity structures and establish whether massive outflows are also driven by collimated jets. The sources have extremely high-velocity wings, highly indicative of jets, and luminosities L>10^5 Lsun, correponding to ZAMS stars of 20-40 Msun. They are ideal to test model predictions and verify whether jets exist in massive YSOs.',\n"," 'Mass loss on the RGB: reaching the limits. For stars with initial masses below about 1 Msol, mass loss on the first red giant branch (RGB) dominates that of the later AGB phase. Nevertheless, RGB mass loss is often parameterised by a simple Reimers law in evolution models. Groenewegen showed that mass loss exists in nearby RGB stars from modelling the SEDs. As follow-up, 5 stars were observed with IRAM and APEX. HIP 53449 was detected in the CO 2-1 line (and marginally in the J=3-2 line), the object with the largest mass-loss rate based on the previous analysis of the SED. The shape of the line profiles is intruiging. The expansion velocity is unexpectedly large, and there is a hint for a rotating disk. The comparison to a line emission code suggests that the CO envelope is significantly smaller than follows from the photodissociation radius. It is proposed to observe HIP53449, and the star with the next largest detection probability HIP 67665, in the CO 2-1 and 3-2 lines. The observations will unequivocally determine the line profiles. More importantly the spatial resolution of ALMA will allow to determine the size of the CO shell and show if it is indeed much smaller than the standard photodissociation radius.',\n"," 'A 170 GHz-wide Complete Spectral Scan of an IR-pumped, Luminous Infrared Galaxy. A wide-band, high-quality, unbiased census of mm/submm lines has now become possible with the advent of ALMA. Here, we propose an ALMA cycle 0, 170 GHz-wide complete spectral scan of the luminous infrared Galaxy NGC4418. For a compact galaxy nucleus such as the one in NGC4418, the line confusion limit can be achieved within a short integration time in cycle 0. NGC4418 is a benchmark object for LIRGs and one of the best targets known to demonstrate the capabilities of ALMA cycle 0. A rich scientific return is guaranteed and will help to understand the molecular emissions from dusty galaxies through cosmic time. With the proposed spectral scan we can identify and quantify excitation mechanisms (collisional, radiative, new maser lines), determine abundances, find new absorption and emission lines, and compare to other Galactic and extragalactic objects. Gas motions through line wings, P-Cygni profiles, or line emission channel maps can be probed in great detail. The narrow (170 km/s) spectral lines allow for a revealing picture of the nuclear chemistry and excitation of NGC 4418 since lines and species can be separated. The first extragalactic submm vibrational lines of HCN and HC3N were detected in NGC4418 and this shows great promise for a rich IR-pumped spectrum and a large variation of species, a research area that warrants further exploration if we are to understand the most dust-enshrouded phases of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'AGE-PRO: the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. We propose a Large Program designed to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks, using a well-defined sample of 30 disks between 0.1-10 Myr old. Gas is the dominant mass constituent of protoplanetary disks. Its structure and evolution profoundly impact every major step of planet formation: planetesimal formation, accretion of planetary atmospheres, and migration of planets. Yet, we do not have a basic understanding of how the gas disk evolves and what mechanism drives the global evolution. This program will provide the first homogeneous and sensitive survey to constrain the evolution of the mass and size of gas disks at three evolutionary phases: the embedded disk phase, the middle-age, and the end of the disk lifetime. By combining deep observations of CO isotopologues and N2H+, we will improve the accuracy of current mass measurements by a factor 10-20, and size measurements by a factor of 5. The results will provide fundamental insights into the global evolution of protoplanetary disks, and provide a key legacy dataset to test current main theories of disk evolution and planet formation.',\n"," 'What Powers the Lyman alpha Blobs?. Narrow band imaging is a powerful tool to search for high redshift star-forming galaxies via Lyman alpha emission. With this method, a particular class of objects, known as \"Lyman alpha blobs\" (LABs), has been identified and characterized by their large physical extent of 30 to 200 kpc. The origin of Lyman alpha emission in LABs is still unclear and under debate. Our deep radio data from ATCA and far-infrared (FIR) archival data from Herschel in protocluster J2143-4423 show that radio and FIR emission is detected in two out of four LABs. These multi-wavelength band data are useful to study the properties of LABs. However, observations with higher angular resolution and sensitivity are definitely needed to reveal the spatial fine structure of the FIR emission and to identify the expected more compact individual galaxy-sized sources whose properties then can be studied in detail. The paucity of detections make the available information very biased and we also need to oberve a large sample. We therefore propose to observe two FIR-detected LABs in J2143-4423 and a large unbiased sample in SSA 22 to study the heating mechanism of LABs and test the star formation (SF)-based model.',\n"," 'The molecular ring orbiting Sgr A*: a small promising site of star formation. There is significant observational evidence pointing to probable star formation occurring in the understudied region called the NE Arm of the Galactic Circumnuclear Ring (CNR). This region has received little attention before but is now of interest due to multiple observations of molecular lines that trace star formation, including a submm continuum source. The radiation and tidal effects of the central supermassive black hole have minimal effects here, and there are observed molecular densities above the Roche-limit, suggesting star formation in the region. We intend to conduct a joint VLA/ALMA project to observe high frequency continuum, SiO, 13CO, and methanol emission towards the NE Arm. With the VLA we will search for ultra-compact HII regions in the high frequency Q-band continuum and methanol emission tracing outflows, while our ALMA observations will search for compact dust continuum sources in addition to jets traced by SiO and 13CO. These observations have not been conducted previously for the region, and the discovery of hot cores or ultra-compact HII regions would provide definitive proof of star formation in the NE Arm.',\n"," 'Dense Molecular Gas in the Super Star Cluster Environment of NGC 5253. Nearby starbursts are forming super star clusters (SSCs), which in many respects appear to be newborn globular clusters. The super star clusters are expected to profoundly influence gas in their immediate neighborhood. Under such hostile conditions, one cannot expect star formation (SF) to proceed in the same fashion as it does in the Galaxy today. It is vital to characterize how SF does occur since every galaxy --- including our own --- goes through an epoch of globular cluster formation. The goal of this project is to use ALMAs great increase in sensitivity (and southern location) to investigate the properties of the natal dense gas toward the extremely young super star cluster forming dwarf, NGC 5253. We propose to map the dense gas tracers, HCN(1--0), HCO$^{+}$(1--0), C$_{2}$H and SiO) on 60 pc scales. The maps will be used to characterize the location, amount, density and chemical properties of the dense gas that form and are influenced by these massive clusters.',\n"," 'Luminous, Dust-Enshrouded High-z Galaxies Selected by Gamma-Ray Bursts. Recent observations have demonstrated that a substantial fraction of GRBs originate from heavily dust-obscured and luminous galaxies at z>1, a population that until recently was not thought to produce GRBs in significant numbers. This discovery has important implications for the connection between GRBs and the overall star-formation rate, suggesting that GRBs can occur in massive and dusty galaxies under certain conditions. We propose to obtain ALMA continuum observations of the ULIRG hosts of six GRBs at z~2 to directly measure their obscured star formation rates, resolve the structure of the hosts in dust emission, and determine whether the bursts originate from compact super-starbursts or more classical modes of star formation. These observations will fill a critical gap in our knowledge of the GRB population, identifying the physical conditions necessary to form GRBs in the high-redshift universe and providing new insight onto the nature of the GRB progenitor and its ability to probe conditions in the most dust-enshrouded galaxies.',\n"," 'Imaging the bright [CII] emission in a quasar host galaxy at z=7.1. High redshift quasars are hosted by the most massive and luminous galaxies in the early universe. Over a year ago, we discovered a bright quasar at z=7.1, J1120+0641, providing a unique opportunity to study the physical processes in a forming massive galaxy at z>7. Our Plateau de Bure Interferometer observations revealed a strong (1.2x10^9 L_sun) [CII] emission line and the far-infrared continuum with a luminosity of 0.5-1x10^12 L_sun. Here we propose to obtain deep ALMA observations at high spatial resolution (~0.24 arcsec, or 1.2 kpc at the redshift of the quasar) to address key aspects that cannot be answered with the available data. In 69 minutes (on-source) of ALMA Band 6 time we will be able to (1) constrain the morphology and kinematics of the emission line gas, (2) produce a map of the star formation as traced by the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity, (3) look for a possible recent merger event and (4) derive a much more accurate dynamical mass. Since the derived far-infrared properties (dust temperature, FIR luminosity, SFR and L_[CII]/L_FIR ratio) of the two well studied highest redshift quasar hosts (J1120+0641 at z=7.1 and J1148+5251 at z=6.4) are strikingly different, it is imperative to expand the sample of quasar host at the highest redshifts. We therefore propose to quadruple the number of [CII] line and FIR continuum detections at z>6.5 by taking snapshot observations (~7.5 minutes on-source) of three new quasar hosts, that we have recently discovered between z=6.6 and z=6.9. Together with the z=7.1 quasar, these are the 4 highest redshift quasars known. The unprecedented sensitivity of ALMA will yield the detection of the [CII] emission line down to a flux of 1 Jy km/s (all z>6 quasar hosts with [CII] observations have line fluxes of >1 Jy km/s). These snapshot observations will already enable us to put the first constraints on the physical properties of the host galaxies at 6.6',\n"," 'ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey. We propose an extensive survey of 33 clusters to a depth of 0.08 mJy (1.2 mm, 1 sigma). This will be accomplished with a 15-GHz-wide spectral scan, to enlarge the survey volume of line emitting galaxies. The sample comes from the best-studied clusters blessed with HST treasury programs, i.e., CLASH, HFF, and RELICS. We will map the high-magnification regions of these clusters with a total coverage of 88 arcmin^2. The proposed survey is the logical next step after ongoing ALMA-HFF and cluster programs, based on successful ALMA detections of faint continuum sources and line emitter candidates in lensing clusters. In conjunction with the rich ACS/WFC3/IRAC data, we will determine the nature of faint submm galaxies and line emitters. Through the redshift distribution, SFR, stellar and ISM masses of sources that only ALMA can locate and study, we will probe the origin of the extragalactic background light, measure the [CII] luminosity functions near the Epoch of Reionization, and constrain the evolution of the molecular gas mass density up to the peak epoch of cosmic star formation. We will also discover rare highly lensed objects for future follow-up with ALMA.',\n"," 'The Outer Disk of V582 Mon (KH 15D). V582 Mon, also known as KH 15D, is a binary T Tauri star with nearly equal mass components totaling 1.3 solar masses in a tight (P=48.37 days), eccentric (e=0.6) orbit. As a member of NGC 2264, it has an inferred age of ~2 Myr and distance of ~750 pc. Its importance derives from the fact that it is embedded in a circumbinary ring that stretches from about 1-4 AU, spanning the terrestrial planet formation zone. The ring reveals its presence by occulting a portion of the binary orbit. It is composed of micron to mm-sized grains and is inclined to the binary plane, which causes precession as a coherent unit on a time scale of ~1000 years. Occultations will cease by ~2030; there is some evidence that a luminous giant planet has formed. Such rings must be a common feature of proto-Tatooine (circumbinary) systems such as KH 15D or we would never have found such a perfectly positioned one. With ~1 hour of ALMA time we can obtain a high confidence confirmation that an outer disk is present, determine its spectral index to about 10%, constraining grain growth, and search for a CO disk which will constrain the total mass of the stellar system and inclination of the disk.',\n"," 'The physical conditions, spatial structure, and the expanding velocity of the dust formation zone of IRC+10216. ALMA high spatial resolution observations of IRC+10216 separated by a two years time interval show resolved continuum and gas structures around the star (1-10 stellar radii) that are moving with different velocities depending on the distance to the star, and that the mass loss process is proceeding through the emission of fragments of shells. We propose to study the innermost zone (1-10 R*) of IRC+10216 through the systematic observation of the continuum emission and of a significant number of vibrationally excited lines of abundant species such as HCN, HNC, SiS, SiC2, and SiO (up to 15000 K in energy). The highest angular resolution of ALMA in bands 6 and 7 (0.015-0.025\") is requested to study the region where dust molecular seeds, and dust itself, are formed. These new observations will also permit to track the spatial movement of the gas and the dust and to derive an expanding velocity of the innermost envelope as a function of the distance to the star. We expect to obtain a unique data set from which the physical conditions and spatial structure of the gas and dust across these inner regions will be derived',\n"," 'Hot water from the inner 25AUs of the Class I source SVS13-A. The origin of terrestrial water is still a source of intense debate. A key element to shed light on it, is how water evolves with time in proto-Sun analogues. Specifically, two aspects are crucial: (1) the amount of water in the planet formation region (~ tens of AU) and (2) its deuterium fractionation. While water has been imaged in a few low-mass Class 0 sources, only single-dish observations (e.g. Herschel) exist towards more evolved Class I to Class III sources, and no detection at all of HDO. Recently, we detected seven HDO lines with upper level energies up to 800 K towards the Class I source SVS13-A. A non-LTE analysis provides severe constraints on the gas emitting size (~0.2\", i.e. 48 AU), temperature (150 K) and density (3 10^7 cm-3). No H2^18O emission has been detected and the lower limit to the HDO/H2O does not help to understand whether it decreases from Class 0 to Class I, as we recently found for CH3OH and H2CO on the same source. We propose here new ALMA high spatial resolution and high sensitivity observations of HDO and H2^18O towards SVS13-A with a twofold goal: reveal the structure of the gas of emitting the hot water, and estimate its deuterium fractionation.',\n"," 'Probing Multiphase CGM in SMM J02399. Previous observations of Ly, [N II]122, CO strongly suggest the existence of a cold, dense and enriched circum-galactic medium (CGM) composed of neutral, ionized and molecular gas, extending up to 100 kpc scale surrounding SMM J02399, potentially fueling the strong star formation and AGN activity in the central galaxies. However, the mass and physical conditions in the large-scale CGM still remain unconstrained. Here we propose to utilize neutral gas tracer [C II], ionized gas tracer [N II]122, molecular gas tracer [C I]609 and CO(5-4) to map and characterize the multiphase gas in CGM. We aim to (1) confirm the extended nature of [N II]205, CO, and [C II] from CGM; (2) map ionized and neutral gas in CGM; (3) constrain physical properties in CGM; (4) derive the scaling relation between Ly and [C II] to assess the powering/excitation mechanism of the former. A successful detection of [C II] in Ly nebulae will also pave the way for the future CGM [C II] surveys, which will answer the key questions including the physical condition of the cold gas in CGM, the mass exchange between CGM and central galaxies, and the evolutionary effect of CGM in fueling star-formation and AGN.',\n"," 'IRAS 04166 and the origin of the EHV component in outflows. Bipolar outflows play a crucial role in the process of star formation, but many aspects of their physics remain poorly understood. Here we propose to investigate the nature of the so-called Extremely High Velocity (EHV) gas, which represents the most collimated, jet-like component seen in the youngest outflows. This component was originally interpreted as resulting from molecular bullets, but recent work suggests that it arises from internal shocks inside a time-variable jet. To investigate this component, we have chosen the outflow from IRAS 04166+2706, a nearby protostar with the most symmetric (and likely pristine) EHV component. Previous ALMA observations of two outer EHV peaks in this source support the jet-shock interpretation of the EHV gas. By mapping the full set of 14 EHV peaks identified with previous PdBI and SMA observations, we will fully test the jet-shock interpretation, study the propagation of the EHV component from the protostar, and test whether the transfer of momentum from the EHV component can potentially accelerate the rest of the outflow. These observations will provide the most complete picture of the EHV gas in outflows currently achievable.',\n"," 'Bipolar Outflows near Sgr A*. Using ALMA, a population of 13CO (2-1) sources were discovered within the inner 2pc of Sgr A* resembling protostellar outflows seen in star forming regions. These sources show approaching and receding lobes of dense gas created during the formation of low-mass stars. The inferred properties, linewidth, jet length, outflow force and total mass of all eleven bipolar sources are consistent with those of young stellar object (YSO) bipolar jets in the disk of the Galaxy. This proposal requests a study of these tantalizing results by making high spectral and spatial resolution observations to detect SiO (5-4) emission entrained by the jet. Detection of SiO emission with velocities of 10s of km/s associated with 11 CO lobes, will provide proof of protostellar jets. The secondary motivation is to observe other molecular diagnostics such as 13CS(5-4) and 13CO(2-1) and 218-235 GHz dust continuum from protostellar disks. A census of the population of low-mass stars would provide a strong constraint on the IMF near Sgr A* and a better estimate of the recent star formation rate with implications on the stellar mass budget in the central pc of the Galactic center.',\n"," 'The SIze and Albedo of New Horizons Distant Kuiper Belt Target (15810) Arawn. Following its flyby of the Pluto system in July 2015, NASAs New Horizons mission embarked on a campaign to exploit the unique capabilities of a spacecraft traveling in the outer Solar System by making observations of Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) at viewing geometries unattainable from Earth. Although the sizes and albedos of the largest of these distant KBO targets are well-known, the size and albedo of (15810) Arawn (1994 JR1) are constrained only loosely by membership in its dynamical class, yet these fundamental physical quantities are within reach of ALMA. Measurement of the geometric albedo of Arawn, when combined with the phase integral measured by New Horizons will provide the spherical albedo of this resonant KBO. The spherical albedo is the ratio of total flux reflected in all directions from a planetary surface to the total solar incident flux; therefore its measurement enables an evaluation of the thermal energy budget of a Solar System surface. This combination of ALMA and New Horizons results, will enable the first comparisons of the surface properties of a Plutino (using the spherical albedo) to properties of the surfaces of other well-studied Solar System objects.',\n"," 'Probing the physical condirtion of the extremely high density prestellar core G208.68-19.20-N2. A compact (r~ 220 au) and extremely dense (> 10^9 cm^-3) object embedded in a filamentary structure has been unveiled in the prestellar core, G208.68-19.20-N2 (G208-N2), in Orion Molecular Cloud 3. This compact object referred as a \"nucleus\" is likely to be in the evolutionary stage immediately before the onset of star formation. In order to study the physical conditions of the nucleus and filament, we plan to constrain the dust temperature using the continuum emission observed with the high frequency bands of ALMA. If the dust temperature is lower than 10 K, the peak of its spectral energy distribution appears in the submillimeter band that can be accessible with the high frequency bands of ALMA. W also plan to study the gas kinematics, such as gas flow, turbulent decay, and rotation in the vicinity of the nucleus using the ortho-H2D+ line emission at 372 GHz. The light deuterium-bearing species like H2D+ might be the unique probe for dense and cold region where most of the molecular species including N2D+ are heavily depleted onto the dust.',\n"," 'Imaging the Peculiar Carbon-Chain Chemistry of IRAS 15398-3359 in Lupus - 2. IRAS15398-3359 in the Lupus molecular cloud is a Class 0 protostar showing peculiar carbon chemistry. In this source, we have found that various carbon-chain molecules and their related molecules such as CCH, c-C3H2, and C4H are extremely abundant. Since these molecules are generally deficient in star forming regions, a similar source is very rare. Only exception known so far is L1527 in Taurus. In these two sources, carbon-chain molecules would be regenerated by evaporation of CH4 from grain mantles followed by subsequent gas-phase reactions(Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry: WCCC). We have observed carbon-chain molecules in L1527 with PdBI, and have found that their abundances are indeed enhanced in the CH4 evaporation region(20-30 K: 1000-2500 AU) around the protostar. Furthermore, the abundances decreases in the central 300-600 AU region, suggesting that they are partly destroyed and/or depleted in the innermost part. In order to establish the concept of the WCCC, it is indispensable to investigate the distributions of carbon-chain molecules in another WCCC source, IRAS15398-3359, at high resolution. Then, we here propose to observe CCH and other carbon-chain related species toward this source. Similarity and difference between the two WCCC sources provide us with important information on the origin and the mechanism of the WCCC. Now the WCCC is recognized as one of the extreme chemical nature of low-mass protostellar cores. The other extreme case is hot corino, characterized by rich existence of saturated complex organic molecules such as HCOOCH3 and C2H5CN. Since the chemical composition of protostellar cores can be regarded as the initial condition for chemical evolution to protoplanetary disks, a thorough understanding of the WCCC through this observation is of fundamental importance in astrochemistry and related fields.',\n"," 'Testing a Chemical Model to Probe Supermassive Black Hole Accretion. The physical mechanisms for forming the obscuring dust tori at the center of AGNs is a fundamental open question in astrophysics. At the center of our Milky Way, a similar question is whether the well-known 2-4 pc, ring-like molecular circumnuclear \"disk\" (CND) is dynamically captured from cooler large-scale gas clouds, or is a long-lived gas/dust ring supported and heated by strong radiation field from the central stellar cluster. In this project, we propose a focused ALMA experiment to detect DCN and DCO+ at where the exterior gas streams may be merging into the hot CND. These deurated species form efficiently when cool molecular gas condenses onto dust grain surfaces, and are destroyed rapidly in the hot gas phase. Observations of these molecules have been widely used as chemical clocks to diagnose the evolutionary status of accretion flows surrounding OB cluster-forming hot molecular cores. This project aim to address the gas accumulation in the innermost part of molecular accretion flows surrounding the nearest supermassive black hole, which will be used to infer the formation mechanism of the AGN obscuring dust tori.',\n"," 'Spying on our Neighbors: Peering into Low Metallicity Molecular Clouds in the Small Magellanic Cloud. A dominant reservoir of H2 gas faint in CO emerges as metallicity decreases, which alters the structure of molecular clouds and perhaps the sites of star formation. With ALMA, we can reach the resolution necessary to see the structure of photodissociation regions and the transition from ``CO-bright to ``CO-faint molecular gas for the first time at 1/5 Solar metallicity in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We propose to map four regions in the Southwest Bar of the SMC at high spatial and spectral resolution (1.6\" or 0.5 pc scales and ~0.1 km/s) in 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1). We will determine the mass, structure, and kinematics of molecular clouds across a range of environments and explore the effect of the CO-faint molecular gas on low metallicity star formation. With the slew of ancillary data in hand (much collected by the Co-Is in this proposal), including PAHs, [CII], [CI], [NII], [OI], dust continuum, and dust-based H2 maps, we can fully exploit the ALMA observations.

Sensitive measurements of the CO emission line in high-z galaxies at sub-galactic scales are now possible with ALMA. In this pilot project, we propose to build a comprehensive sample of z~2 star-forming main-sequence galaxies observed in CO(3-2) emission. Making use of the ALMA archive and literature, we have gathered bright unresolved CO(3-2) detections for 4 galaxies to perform follow-up observations and resolve the galactic disks at ~2.5 kpc-scale. We will characterize the gas distribution and kinematics of the likely dominant component in term of mass in those main-sequence galaxies. We will measure the molecular gas extension, rotation velocity, velocity dispersion. The molecular gas extension will be compared with that of the stars constrained from HST-CANDELS, and future JWST, imaging. Available Halpha KMOS-IFU observations will enable reliable comparison between the molecular and ionized gas kinematics.

Far-IR [C II] 158 micron line and the [N II] 122 & 205 micron lines are important ISM cooling transitions that are becoming popular probes for studying high redshift galaxies as a result of the advent of ALMA high frequency performance (Bands 8, 9, & 10). While they are commonly used as tracers of cold gas and SFR, they both arise in relative low density ionized gas in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies and are subject to complications due to variations in radiation field, metallicity, ionization, and gas accretion/ejection. The physical properties gas emitting these FIR lines are even less well understood.

ALMA has now provided the first detailed images of the dust-obscured star formation in submillimeter-bright galaxies a population of high-z, highly star-forming galaxies which remain poorly understood. These high-fidelity 870um continuum images reveal strikingly detailed substructures which have been alternately interpreted by various studies either as 1) bars, rings, clumps and spiral arms, or 2) evidence for mergers. Unfortunately, crucial kinematic information is lacking, rendering us unable to distinguish between these scenarios. Here we propose high-resolution (0.2 arcsec/1.5 kpc) CO(5-4) observations in four sources with confirmed bright CO luminosities. Thanks to its tight, linear correlation with IR luminosity, the CO(5-4) line is an ideal tracer of the dense gas directly fueling the dust-obscured starbursts. These observations will provide the missing kinematic information needed to confirm/refute the interpretation of the intriguing morphologies seen in these sources. Together with the approved JWST Cycle 1 NIRCam+MIRI imaging, this proposal will provide the best view to-date of these elusive high-z galaxies.',\n"," 'Sub-millimeter excess in a low metallicity cloud in the Magellanic Bridge. The Magellanic Bridge is a filamentary structure of about 15 to 21 kpc seen in neutral hydrogen (HI) lying between the LMC and the SMC. It represent the nearest tidally interaction between these two galaxies some 200 Myr ago. It has a lower metallicity than the SMC and therefore allow to study the ISM in extreme conditions. Recent studies have revealed the presence of young (< 200Myr) massive stars and CO molecular clouds. The latter are barely resolved in single-dish observations and are spatially related to warm dust emission sources, as recently established by the Spitzer SMC-SAGE and Herschel HERITAGE studies. We have obtained 870 micron images of one of these sources, Magellanic Bridge Source A. Surprisingly, its dust emission shows a large submillimeter excess, indicative of either very cold dust or a dramatically different submillimeter emissivity. We propose to study this source in CO(1-0) and (2-1) and the associated continuum at arcsecond resolution to determine the physical properties of the molecular cloud.',\n"," 'Inventory of molecular gas in a z~0.7 galaxy group: a test case for environmental star formation regulation in galaxies. How do dense environments, such as groups and clusters, affect star formation regulation and galaxy growth? What are the physical processes responsible for quenching in these structures? This proposal adresses these questions by probing the overall molecular gas content in and around the galaxies living in the COSMOS-Gr30 group at z~0.7. Deep MUSE observations indeed revelead a huge and unexpected ionized gas structure wrapping around 8 of the 45 galaxies located in an over-dense region of this group. This gas has probably been expelled recently from the galaxies due to tidal interactions, stripping, or outflows. The goal of this proposal is to make a census of the overall molecular gas content, i.e. both in the galaxies and in the intra-group medium, available for future star formation in this remarkable structure. To achieve this goal we will map this region in CO(3-2) in order to unveil the extended molecular gas in the intra-group medium, characterize the star formation efficiency in the galaxies and their potential dependence with their location in the structure. These observations will provide crucial tests for star formation regulation models in galaxies.',\n"," 'Chemical survey of high-mass YSOs in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Studying the chemistry of the interstellar medium in different metallicity environment is important to understand the chemical evolution of the Universe.

High-mass YSOs in the Small Magellanic Cloud are excellent targets and sub-pc resolution observations are feasible for them with ALMA. Previous projects targeted 2/3 of the spectroscopically confirmed YSO sample, but so far not hot core was detected. Here we propose ALMA Band 7 observations to complement the chemical survey of the spectroscopically confirmed YSOs in the SMC. We target SO2, HCO+, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, H2CS, NO, etc. lines to identify hot cores and we will compare the fractional abundances of the detected molecules to that of the hot cores in the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Clouds.

The temperature of the N2H+ emitting dense gas near the NGC3603 starburst cluster. Feedback from massive stars on dense, star forming gas may significantly affect the resulting stellar population. Higher temperatures may allow for more massive cores to form before they proceed to collapse. As part of a larger effort to search for dense gas temperature variations due to feedback and any resulting differences in fragmentation we here propose to measure the temperature of an allegedly very cold gas component traced by APEX N2H+ observations in several dense clumps nearby the NGC3603 galactic young starburst cluster. H2CO measurements indicate temperatures as high as 50K for the clumps, too warm for N2H+ to survive. The detection of N2H+ in these seemingly warm cores may imply that there is an even colder component, shielded from the feedback, The proposed N2H+ temperature measurements will show whether the N2H+ emission arises in warm, dense gas heated by the cluster (as has been found in Orion by Teng & Hirano 2020), or whether indeed COLD dense gas may still exist in clumps subject to strong external heating.',\n"," 'Physical mechanisms of bulge formation in galaxies at z=2. Massive quiescent galaxies are extremely compact at z=2 while the majority of star-forming galaxies have more extended stellar disks. Theoretically, ~40% of massive star-forming galaxies are expected to form a dense compact core through dissipative processes such as violent disk instabilities or mergers (wet compaction). We propose 1.1 mm observations of 20 massive log(M*)>10.6 rotation-dominated star-forming galaxies at z = 2.0-2.6, whose kinematic properties (including the spin parameter) and stellar structure are well-characterized by the KMOS3D/CANDELS/3D-HST surveys. High (0.2arcsec) and low (1.5arcsec) spatial resolution 1.1 mm mapping will allow us to characterize the true spatial distribution of the star formation activity and identify unambiguously the presence of compact (Re~1 kpc) starbursts in the galaxy centers. By investigating whether the star-forming targets with low spin parameter more likely exhibit a central starburst compared to the mass- and star formation-matched control sample with high spin parameter, we will directly test the hypothesis that wet compaction plays a crucial role in bulge formation at the peak epoch of galaxy formation.',\n"," 'CON-quest: Finding the most obscured galaxy nuclei. Studying the accretion and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their surrounding stellar components is essential for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Interacting Luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies U/LIRGs are usually strongly linked to nuclear growth since they funnel massive amounts of gas and dust to their nuclei. To study the most embedded activity, we must probe behind the curtains of dust with a line that is uniquely tracing extreme nuclear conditions. In particular, compact, luminous and extremely opaque (N(H2)>1e24 cm-2) Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are extreme regions of exceptional nuclear growth. We propose a survey of the 1mm transition of vibrationally excited HCN (HCN-VIB) in a volume-limited sample of ULIRGs and LIRGs. We will investigate if CONs are uniquely formed in on-going interactions/mergers. Or if they can also be linked to more secular evolution as indicated by the surprising discovery of CONs in ISM-poor disk galaxies. The simultaneous observations of the ground state HCN and HCO+ lines will be used to chart the structure and dynamics of the central gas disk, and to search for dense outflows with extremely high sensitivity.',\n"," 'Star Formation, Shocks, and AGN in a Pre-Starburst Galaxy Collision. We propose an ALMA CO(1-0) map plus three HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) pointings of the pre-starbust interacting galaxy pair IC 2163 and NGC 2207. CO will trace the total molecular gas distribution and kinematics. HCO+ and HCN will spatially resolve excesses of dense gas to relate to nuclear flows, turbulence, large-scale shocks, and local star formation rates. Line ratios in these AGN and AGN-free nuclei will probe the link between dense gas reservoirs, nuclear star formation, and black hole activity. Starburst activity in galaxy mergers can be driven by nuclear flows, gas fragmentation, and large-scale shocks, and can be balanced by feedback from young stars and black holes. The role of these mechanisms in boosting star formation efficiency in mergers is poorly understood. This galaxy pair offers an ideal laboratory to study these phenomena. Their grazing collision has increased gas turbulence, produced Super Star Clusters and shocks, and fueled nuclear activity. It is well observed and modeled, with HST optical, SST infrared, XMM X-ray, VLA 21 cm emission and 6 cm and 20 cm continuum, Herschel PACS and SPIRE broadband data, and simulations fitting over 30 features.',\n"," 'Testing dust evolution models in T Tau. Multiple stellar system are crucial to understanding planet formation, both for statistical reasons (they are about a half of the stellar population) and because they provide extreme conditions to test our models. Indeed, theoretical modelling indicates that dust coagulation is inhibited by tidal interactions in binary discs. This process can potentially halt dust trapping in bright rings adjacent to emission gaps, which is considered to be the main process to accumulate grains and form planetesimals. We argue that T Tau is the ideal target to test these processes: a gap was recently detected in its bright primary so that we can examine evidence for grain growth and dust trapping adjacent to this gap. Moreover, its secondary and tertiary components are in the close binary regime where models suggest that only very small grains should be present. We propose to observe T Tau at high resolution and sensitivity in band 3 and 4. These data will be coupled with archival band 6 and 7 observations with the aim of studying the properties of dust in this system. Our results will be then compared with the result of similar works targeting single-star discs.',\n"," 'What is the role of major mergers in galaxy formation and evolution?. In the local universe, the role of major mergers in triggering enhanced star formation is well-established, primarily based on the evidence that the morphology of many IR-bright galaxies are highly disturbed. In contrast, the significance of major mergers in forming stars at high redshifts is under debate, due to increasing observational evidence of z ~ 1-3 galaxies with copious star-forming clumps without an apparent equal mass companion. However, the fraction of major mergers may be significantly underestimated because visually distinguishing late-stage mergers or post-mergers from isolated systems is exceedingly difficult. We address this problem by mapping CO(2-1) emission at 50 pc scales in 14 disk-like post-mergers in the local universe. By detecting and analyzing the molecular clumps and disk-wide structure in a sample of post-mergers and comparing it to nearby isolated early and late-type systems, we will address the role of major mergers in the formation of molecular clumps in the extended disks. This is particularly important in understanding the formation process of clumpy starbursts and ultimately the role of major mergers in the history of cosmic star formation.',\n"," 'Sub-kiloparsec mapping of the molecular gas in a quintessential merger-driven starburst at z=1.52. We aim to map the spatially-resolved molecular gas distribution using the CO 5-4 line and dust continuum of PACS-787, an archetypal twin-galaxy merger at z=1.52 with extreme star formation rates from Herschel and ALMA. We already have CO measurements with ALMA of two transitions: J=2-1 at 2\" resolution (giving total gas mass) and J=5-4 at 0.3-0.4\" resolution (gas and dust mass on ~1 kpc scales). These show a merger of two massive gas-rich galaxies separated by 8.6 kpc, a high efficiency of forming stars in both nuclei, and the existence of compact (r ~ 1 kpc), likely counter-rotating disks that may funnel gas inflows to the nuclear regions. With a spatial resolution of 0.04\", we will map the structure and kinematics of the two galaxies on scales of ~300 pc. A deep map of the two galaxies at such resolution will allow us to accurately model the two disks, derive their dynamical masses, constrain the L_CO to gas mass conversion factor, establish to which extent these starbursts are driven by higher gas content or higher star formation efficiency (SFE) and explore variations (radial or in clumps) of the SFE, thus shedding light on the physics of starbursts at high redshift.',\n"," 'Determination of the 12C/13C isotopic ratio in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. The knowledge of 12C/13C isotopic ratio and its spatial variation are important because 12CO and 13CO are the most and the second most abundant molecules and their line ratio provides important information to constrain physical state of molecular gas. In our galaxy, there is a systematic gradient in the 12C/13C ratio across in our galaxy; from 24 at the center to 70 at 12 kpc, whereas reported 12C/13C ratios in external galaxy centers are higher values of > 40. In order to understand the discrepancy of the central 12C/13C ratio between our galaxy and external galaxies, we propose the optically-thin 12CN(N=1-0) and 13CN(N=1-0) emission observations toward the disk of the gar-rich starburst galaxy NGC 253. If there exists a radial gradient in the 12C/13C ratio within the disk of NGC 253, the 12CN(N=1-0)/13CN(N=1-0) increases from the center to the bar, and the spiral arm. In contrast, if the exists no radial gradient in the 12C/13C isotopic ratio, 12CN(N=1-0)/13CN(N=1-0) shows a constant value of ~50 regardless of the position in NGC 253. We will obtain a new insight a new insight of the 12C/13C isotopic ratio in external galaxies, and will expand such a study to other galaxies.',\n"," 'Revealing Major Mergers Among the Extreme Star Forming Hosts of the Fastest Growing Super-Massive Black Holes at z~4.8. We propose a pilot study to probe the host systems of fast-growing Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs) at z~4.8, which would likely become the most massive BHs known (M_BH>=10^{10} M_sun) before z~4. Our Herschel observations show that these sources are hosted in two types of extreme star-forming (SF) galaxies: one with SFR>2000 M_sun/yr, indicative of major mergers as the common triggering mechanism for both SF and AGN activity, and another group with SFR~450 M_sun/yr, that may be related to secular evolution, or to AGN-driven feedback. The proposed ALMA observations will test this scenario, by probing the distribution of gas and SF, at scales of ~2 kpc, in the host systems of three objects in each group. The luminous [CII]157.7 um line, which may be detected in most of the sources, would probe the dynamics of the hosts and will provide a clear test for the occurrence of major mergers. The [CII] line would also allow us to estimate the dynamical masses of the hosts, and thus estimate the M_BH/M_dyn ratio at z~4.8. Thus, ALMA can probe the relevance of major mergers, possible feedback or secular growth for a well-defined sample of high-redshift, fast-growing BHs and host galaxies.',\n"," 'Tracing the Origins of Nitrogen Bearing Organics Toward Orion KL. A comprehensive analysis of a broadband 1.2 THz wide spectral survey of the Orion Kleinmann-Low nebula (Orion KL) has shown that nitrogen bearing complex organics trace systematically hotter gas than O-bearing organics toward this source. The origin of this O/N dichotomy remains a mystery. If complex molecules originate from grain surfaces, N-bearing species may be more difficult to remove from grain surfaces than O-bearing organics. Theoretical studies, however, have shown that hot (T=300 K) gas phase chemistry can produce high abundances of N-bearing organics while suppressing the formation of O-bearing complex molecules. We propose here to map, in exquisite detail, the temperature structure and D/H ratio of the complex N-bearing organic methyl cyanide (CH3CN) toward the Orion KL hot core. If gas phase formation routes are significant at high temperatures, we will observe a decreasing gradient in the D/H ratio of CH3CN with increasing kinetic temperature. The proposed observations will shed light on the origin of all complex N-bearing organics in the interstellar medium.',\n"," 'Circumnuclear molecular disks in early-type galaxies as a probe of black hole masses. ALMA will make it possible to measure masses of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies via an entirely new method, by mapping the kinematics of rotating, circumnuclear molecular disks. HST images provide an optimal method for pre-selection of targets, because ~10% of early-type galaxies have circumnuclear dust disks on arcsecond scales which are associated with regular rotational kinematics. However, there are very few southern-hemisphere early-type galaxies that have round, symmetric dust disks and known CO fluxes. We propose 12CO(2-1) observations of the six best and most promising southern-hemisphere targets culled from an extensive search of the HST archives. Our efficient observations will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of the black holes and reveal rapid rotation from molecular gas in the inner disks, and we will carry out dynamical modeling to derive constraints on the black hole masses. Once we have determined the CO fluxes and linewidths, in future ALMA cycles we will propose to carry out deeper and higher-resolution observations that will provide exquisitely accurate black hole masses.',\n"," 'Water BEARS. We propose a comprehensive study of water lines in the brightest sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) on the Southern sky, from our compilation of ALMA redshift campaigns on Herschel galaxies in cycles 4-7 (collectively termed the Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey, or BEARS), more than tripling the number of H2O detections in SMGs, in order to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and test for drivers of \"starburst\" mode vs \"main sequence\" stellar mass assembly in the ramp-up to Cosmic Noon. Water is the most abundant molecule in star-forming galaxies after H2 and CO, and is an important coolant of warm gas with line luminosities comparable to CO. The H2O transitions are driven by pumping from far-IR photons, so the H2O line luminosities correlate linearly with far-IR luminosity and are hence the best tracer of SFR over at least three orders of magnitude. The H2O and CO line profiles are very similar, and resolved CO and H2O studies show they are co-spatial, implying that gravitational lens magnifications derived from CO morphologies can be applied also to H2O lines, and that differential magnification between H2O and CO can be neglected.',\n"," '[CI] as a molecular gas tracer in star forming galaxies at high redshift. The CO(1-0) transition is the main tracer of the cold molecular gas in galaxies. However, it is severely limited at high redshift due to its intrinsic faintness and reduced contrast against a warmer CMB. The [CI](1-0) line has been proven to be a promising alternative molecular gas tracer, since it has a similar critical density to CO(1-0) and maintains a higher contrast against the CMB. However, no study has directly compared the ground-state [CI] and CO transitions in a high-z galaxy due to the low number of current CO(1-0) detections at z>2. This is set to change with incoming VLA observations targeting CO(1-0) in an unprecedented sample of 30 unlensed sources at z=2-5. We propose to target [CI] in 15 sources from this sample, which will allow us to 1)Constrain the CO(1-0)/[CI](1-0) correlation and investigate trends with e.g, dust mass; 2)Test CO, [CI] and dust-based molecular gas mass estimates; 3)Place the first observational constraints on the CMB suppression of CO(1-0) across redshift and 4)Derive the local ISM conditions in the targets. The proposed study will more than double the current number of unlensed z>2 submm galaxies with both CO(1-0) and [CI](1-0) detections.',\n"," 'HeLMS-1: An AGN-Starburst at z=1.9. We propose to explore the morphology and kinematics of the recently identified Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)-Starburst, HeLMS-1 at z=1.91, using ALMA in Band 9 to observe the C+ emission line. One of the strongest sources detected in the Herschel surveys, HeLMS-1 displays intense CO emission lines and dust continuum that trace structures seen in Keck and HST near-infrared images, revealing a system lensed by a group of galaxies at z=0.5. The C+ emission line, expected to be unusually strong with a flux of ~650 Jy km/s, will trace in exquisite details the reservoir of atomic gas in HeLMS-1. In addition, we will probe the dense gas of the AGN torus in the CO(16-15) emission line, together with the underlying dust continuum. The bright nature of HeLMS-1 provides a unique opportunity to reveal the C+ and dust emission at high angular resolution (0.03\") and S/N across the entire lensing system. After applying a lens model, the new data will reveal, at scales of 50 pc or less in the source plane, the properties of this exceptional AGN-Starburst system at the peak of cosmic evolution, leading to a breakthrough in our understanding of this class of sources.',\n"," 'JET-ISM interactions in a radio-loud merging galaxy at the initial AGN feedback stage. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) has been recognized as an important process in the evolution of galaxies. One type of AGN feedback takes the form of interactions of jets induced by AGN activity with the ISM. From numerical simulations, it has been predicted that cold molecular gas in the ISM that are affected by jets may be compressed by the high pressure, dissociated by shocks, or driven out of a host galaxy by outflows. However it is still not clear how jet-ISM interactions affect on cold molecular gas. From our previous study using ALMA Band3 data, we discovered a large warped disk of molecular gas and small-scale (4 kpc) radio lobes in a merging galaxy, Arp 187. It is quite intriguing, because the kinematic age of the radio-jets is quite young (0.06 Myr). Arp 187 is the clearest case of on-going jet-ISM interactions apparently buried within the rich-ISM of the host galaxy. We thus propose to image Arp 187 in the dense gas tracers in Band 7 and the continuum emission at Band 3 and Band 4 in order to characterize the young radio jets, estimating the spatially-resolved spectral ages, and look for signatures of cold molecular gas shocked/compressed by the jets.',\n"," 'Water in the Wind of the High Redshift Radio Galaxy MRC 1138-262: Does Molecular Gas Reform in Outflows?. MRC1138-262 at z=2.156 is one of the best studied radio galaxies in the distant Universe. It has all the halmarks of a galaxy that is in the \"quenching phase\" of AGN feedback -- it is already massive, has a large gas content, and is driving a powerful outflow. A recent detection of the 0-0 H2 S(3) line with Spitzer suggests it has a significant amount of shock heated molecular gas. By analogy with nearby AGN, the question is, how does molecular gas participate in the outflow when such gas should be easily destroyed? One possible mechanism for solving this puzzle is having the molecular gas \"reform\" on dust grains in the flow. The critical observation is to determine the dynamics, cooling rate, and distribution of the molecular gas in an important cooling line for shocks such as water and determine the relation of these cooling lines to the dust continuum. To begin to address this question, we propose to observe the vigorous outflow in MRC1138-262 in a water, CO(7-6), and [CI]J=2-1 lines that are redshifted into band 6 around 237-256 GHz. By using the C32-3 array, we can acheive sub-arcsecond resolution in the lines and dust continuum to match the resolution of our ground based optical emission line data. If the warm ionized gas and the molecular gas share the same kinematics and the dust has a similar morphology to both the WIM and CMM, then this support the notion that perhaps the molecular gas reforms in the wind on dust grains as has been observed locally in shock regions (e.g. Stephans Quintet). While this program is obviously only a small step in our developing understanding of the nature of molecules in outflows, it is an important in that it begins to constrain how such molecular outflows develop and are sustained and in an environment which is much more extreme than in local AGN. As such, observing MRC 1138-262 provides strigent tests of our ideas on how the quenching phase of feedback might work.',\n"," 'AGN feedback and molecular line flux ratios in dust/gas-rich ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Although scrutinizing deeply buried AGNs in merging dust/gas-rich ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) is very important to understand how supermassive black holes grow in mass in the early universe, it has been hampered by large dust extinction. Molecular line flux ratios in the (almost) dust-extinction-free (sub)millimeter wavelength range can be a powerful tool for this purpose, because an AGN and a starburst have different energy generation mechanisms and so feedback to the surrounding molecular gas can be different. Based on pre-ALMA and our ALMA Cycles 0 and 2 observations, it is argued that enhanced HCN emission is a good AGN indicator. However, its effectiveness is not fully verified yet, because some exceptions exist. We propose ALMA observations of nearby ULIRGs with isotopologues of HCN, HCO+, and HNC to estimate flux attenuation of HCN, HCO+, and HNC by line opacity. Our ultimate goal is to establish the most solid energy diagnostic method of dusty ULIRGs, based on line-opacity-corrected intrinsic molecular flux ratios. ALMAs high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, and stable spectral baseline are crucial for the success of this experiment.',\n"," 'Zooming in on the parsec-scale structure of CO gas at low metallicity and its relation to star formation. The star formation rate is proportional to the surface density of molecular gas, for a wide range of metallicities. Models predict that the structure of CO-emitting gas should change with metallicity and radiation field: extended CO emission and CO \"clumps\" should shrink as metallicity decreases or radiation field strength increases. This effect has never been directly observed before, and models of CO formation have not been put to a test. Additionally, the effects of those changes on the star formation process, which occurs in dense, CO-emitting gas, are unknown. We propose to obtain deep maps of two transitions (1-0 and 2-1) of three CO isotopes (12CO, 13CO, and C18O) in 6 regions of two low-metallicity galaxies, the LMC and the SMC. These observations will allow us to test CO photo-chemical models by providing deep maps of the pc-scale structure, column density, thermal, and chemical state of the CO-emitting gas at two low metallicities and a range of radiation fields. By comparing the CO maps to pc-resolution tracers of star formation, specifically 24 micron emission and young stellar objects, we will bridge the gap between Galactic and extragalactic star formation studies',\n"," 'Probing the stellar IMF in main sequence galaxies in the early Universe. We request ALMA observing time in order to built on our success of using it as a powerful new probe of the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) in dusty starburst galaxies (Zhang et al. 2018 Nature). Isotopes of CNO elements are solely produced by stellar nucleosynthesis, and ejected into interstellar medium (ISM) imprinted with IMF. Accomplished with galactic chemical evolution modelling, which is well-benchmarked against rich data in the Milky Way, the 13CO/C18O line ratio has been demonstrated as a powerful tool for probing stellar IMF in galaxies across cosmic time. This opens up a unique new window of exploring fundamental issues of galaxy evolution in the Early Universe, exploiting recent advances in stellar physics. Our current request for ALMA observations seeks to expand the scope of our investigation in starbursts to include the IMF and dense gas fraction in main sequence galaxies in the early Universe, which contribute most of the cosmic star-formation.',\n"," 'Multi-Band Polarization of the Edge-On Disk L1527: A Critical Test for Grain Alignment by Poloidal Magnetic Fields. Measuring magnetic fields in circumstellar disks using dust polarization observations has, to date, proven to be unsuccessful. The main problem is two competing polarization mechanisms to magnetic field dust grain alignment: self-scattering and grain alignment from radiative anisotropy. On the other hand, edge-on young circumstellar disks offer two large advantages in measuring poloidal fields by maximizing the plane of sky component for a poloidal field, and providing gradients in optical depth along the minor axis that will cause magnetic field dust grain aligned polarization to flip from parallel to the magnetic field at high optical depth to perpendicular to the magnetic field at low optical depth. The young edge on Class 0 source L1527 is the perfect source to test for poloidal fields because we have 1) polarization observations at 1mm and 870 microns; 2) optical depth models in ALMA Bands 3 to 7; 3) predictive models of polarization emission based on that optical depth; and 4) evidence that radiative grain alignment is minimal in this source. L1527 Band 3 and Band 4 polarization observations are essential to reveal a poloidal field for the first time in a disk.',\n"," 'Properties of Molecular Gas and Dust in the Close Environment of a Long-duration Gamma-ray Burst. Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are thought to be originated from the explosions of massive stars, and accordingly they are expected to occur in molecular clouds. Previous studies of absorption in the spectra of GRB afterglows suggest a large gas reservoir in the GRB circumburst comparable with those found in GMCs. However, absorption studies only probes the line of sight to GRBs, and no measurement of molecular gas content in GMC scale has ever been done. We propose observations of CO and dust continuum emission in the host galaxy of GRB980425, the nearest GRB (36.1 Mpc). The host is the unique target because of its proximity, providing an opportunity to probe the environment around the GRB in 100 pc scale (with 0.59\" angular resolution). The primary goal is to verify that a GRB actually occur in the environment of dense molecular gas. Our CO(1-0), CO(3-2), and dust emission observations will reveal the properties of molecular gas and dust (molecular gas content, excitation condition, distribution of molecular gas and dust, and velocity field) in the close environment around a GRB for the first time, allowing us to investigate the formation mechanism of a GRB progenitor.',\n"," 'LIghting up dark matter with dust: probing the anomalous lensing substructure in J0946+1006. Dark matter \"subhalos\" around massive lensing galaxies slightly distort the gravitational arcs formed by background sources. This effect can constrain the population of low-mass (~10^8 Msun) halos, and distinguish between dark matter types (cold, warm, etc). Observationally however, the most striking detection so far is of a substructure in the lens J0946+1006 that is far more massive than should exist in any current model, without hosting a luminous galaxy. The evidence for this structure rests on modelling HST images of arcs from a bright z=0.6 background spiral. The detailed arc structures cannot be reconciled with smooth models for the lensing galaxy, and seem to demand an extra mass of >3x10^9 Msun within a ~1 kpc aperture, with no luminous counterpart. The regions in the arcs that are closest to the perturber, and which are most sensitive to its influence, are notably red, showing the likely presence of dust in the background galaxy. Here, we propose ALMA continuum observations to detect this dust in emission, to determine its lensed structure at high angular resolution, and hence better constrain the properties of the apparently CDM-defying dark structure.',\n"," 'Measuring the luminosity of massive protostars via their millimeter brightness temperature. A major hurdle to improving our understanding of the process of massive star formation is the inability to determine the luminosity of individual massive protostars in deeply-embedded protoclusters. The problem is caused by the lack of high-resolution telescopes in the mid- to far-infrared that cover the peak of the Planck curve. Without being able to apportion the total luminosity among the cluster members, it is impossible to construct luminosity functions which might shed light on how clusters evolve. The advent of ALMAs long baseline capability offers a new technique for measuring the luminosity of compact millimeter sources via their brightness temperature. The high dust column density around a massive protostar makes it optically-thick to radiation shortward of about 1 mm wavelength. By measuring the angular size and brightness temperature at a few wavelengths near unity opacity, one can compute a luminosity estimate from the Stefan-Boltzmann law. By observing with 0.07 arcsecond (130AU) resolution in Band 4, 6 and 8, we propose to test this technique on several protostars in the M17 UC1-IRS5 region whose 1-20 micron luminosities have recently been measured on the VLT.',\n"," 'High-resolution Observations of the Tadpole near the Center of Our Galaxy. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are an important ingredient that helps create supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at galactic centers, while none of IMBH candidates are accepted as definitive. Recently, several IMBH candidates in the Galactic center (GC) were reported based on the presence of compact molecular clouds with extremely broad velocity widths. \"Tadpole\" is such a compact cloud discovered at 2.6 arcminutes northwest of the Galactic nucleus, Sgr A*. It is spatially isolated, having a characteristic head-tail structure with a steep velocity gradient in the position-velocity map. Applying the center-of-gravity technique, the kinematics of Tadpole can be reproduced by a Keplerian orbit around a point-like object of 100 thousand solar masses. To confirm this result, we propose ALMA observations of Tadpole in band 7 and 3. High-resolution images will delineate the entity of the orbit stream, diagnose the physical conditions along the stream, and thereby examine the Kaplerian model around a point-like massive object. We expect that Tadpole can provide a promissing candidate for IMBH in the GC environment, which greatly contribute to the understanding of SMBH formation.',\n"," 'Outflow launching scales in a Class I protostar. In this program we will investigate the innermost regions of a Young Stellar Object to trace the kinematics of the molecular gas very close to the launching point of the protostellar outflow. With ALMA in its largest configuration currently offered, it is now possible for the first time to directly trace molecular gas at the relevant spatial scales, i.e., radii of ~3 AU. We aim to discriminate whether outflow launch regions are confined to a few stellar radii or that extended disk winds also play a role. To achieve this, we will directly compare our ALMA spectral line profiles, at unprecedented angular resolution, with our numerical simulations that are specifically developed with the aim of simultaneously resolving small outflow launching scales as well as larger, traditionally observable length scales. At the same time, our observations will be sensitive to disk rotation signatures, allowing us to determine any deviations from pure Keplerian rotation in the very inner disk. This would have implications for our understanding of protostellar disk dynamics.',\n"," 'Fragmentation of massive dense clumps: unveiling the initial conditions of high-mass star formation. This is the resubmission of project 2012.1.00366.S, approved in cycle-1, postponed to cycle-2, but not observed yet. The project aims at determining the population of dense cores (size, number, spatial distribution) embedded in 11 carefully selected massive clumps through high-angular resolution observations of N2H+ (3-2) and (sub-)mm continuum, in order to test high-mass star formation competing theories. High-mass stars are born from the gravitational collapse of such clumps (i) either via competitive accretion in highly fragmented clumps (ii) or through accretion onto single cores if fragmentation is suppressed. Simulations show that the fragmentation process is efficiently inhibited if a strong magnetic support dominates the dynamics during collapse. Vice-versa, a faint magnetic support favours the formation of many small fragments. Therefore, if the magnetic support dominates over turbulence in the formation of massive stars, we expect a majority of clumps with low fragmentation levels, and vice-versa.',\n"," 'Vertical Stratification of Turbulence in Protoplanetary Disks: the CS tool. Turbulence is thought to be a key ingredient for angular momentum transport, mixing processes, and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks, but was rather poorly constrained by molecular line observations. We recently used CS (a ``heavy molecule for disks) to separate the thermal and turbulent components of the local line width in DM Tau, and obtained unambiguous determination of the (radially averaged) turbulent motions. The turbulence magnitude is high, around Mach 0.5, in contrast with derivations from viscous spreading of disks, or accretion rates. This may be the first evidence for a vertical stratification of the turbulence in protoplanetary disks. We propose here to use the unique combination of high spatial and spectral resolving power and sensitivity of ALMA to image CS 5-4 (and incidentally CN 2-1 plus two lines of HC3N) to go one step further and probe the radial dependency of the turbulence in the disk around DM Tau.',\n"," 'Investigation of Molecular Clouds Traced by CI. We propose to observe NGC613 in CI, 13CO and C18O(1-0) with ALMA to investigate molecular cloud evolution with a spatial resolution of ~20pc. It has been considered that a dominant CI emitting region is the photo-dissociation region (PDR). However some observations of Galactic sources revealed that CI exists also deep within molecular clouds where UV radiation is attenuated. CI may also trace an early phase of molecular cloud formation from diffuse atomic clouds. The nuclear ring of NGC613 is the best targets for this study because the age gradient of stars along the ring is found from near-infrared observations. Using the age gradient and the kinematics of the molecular clouds along the ring, we can evaluate the time evolution of molecular clouds. Formation of molecular clouds from diffuse atomic clouds is supported in case that CI is enhanced in the upstream side of CO peaks or dense gas regions. The high CI-to-CO ratio in the downstream region of association of CI with massive stars means that CI is produced in PDR. Observations with high resolution toward the nuclear ring of NGC613 will clarify usefulness of CI as a molecular gas tracer and time evolution of molecular clouds.',\n"," 'Resolving the double gaps in the disk around HD 169142. Gaps and holes of the transitional disks have been attracting attention, since such structure has been expected to be the result of the dynamical interaction between the forming planet and the disk, though grain growth and photoevaporation can also create such structures. Recently, Subaru/HiCIAO near-infrared observation revealed a possible double-gapped structure in the transitional disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 169142. Such structure is hard to be created by photoevaporation and/or grain growth alone, thus double-gapped structure can be a smoking-gun evidence that the forming planets are actually present in the disk. However, infrared observations can trace only the surface region of the disk, thus the Subaru/HiCIAO detected gap can be either a true radial gap or rather a shadow casted by the inner disk structure. To know what is occurring in the possible double-gapped disk of HD 169142, here we propose to make high angular resolution imaging of the dust and gas disk around HD 169142 with ALMA in Band 7. Both the inner and outer gaps should be clearly resolved for the first time with the high spatial resolution (0.165”) achieved with ALMA, hence we can discuss the distribution of dust and gas in the gaps simultaneously. When both the dust and gas are depleted in the gaps, it strongly indicates that the forming planets are responsible for such double-gapped structure. When only the dust is depleted and the gas component remains in the gaps, it implies that the grain growth is a likely cause of the double-gapped structure of dust disk. In any case, this observation will reveal the origin of the amazing double-gapped structure found in the disk around transitional object HD 169142, and it will contribute our understanding of the evolution of transitional disks and planet formation.',\n"," 'Anchoring Spiral Galactic Magnetic Fields in Molecular Clouds. The formation of molecular clouds is poorly understood. Many cloud formation models assume that a large-scale galactic magnetic field is irrelevant at the scale of individual clouds, because the turbulence and rotation of a cloud may randomize the orientation of its magnetic field. The only observation of cloud fields in a face-on galaxy (M33, Li & Henning, Nature, 2011), however, supports the opposite picture: galactic fields could be strong enough to impose their direction upon individual clouds, thereby regulating cloud accumulation and fragmentation. Our location in the disk of the Galaxy makes an assessment of the situation difficult and observations of clouds in face-on galaxies are necessary. Only ALMA can offer the resolution and sensitivity to survey magnetic fields of clouds in face-on galaxies using the polarization of thermal dust emission. In this proposal, we start with NGC 628, a bright grand design spiral galaxy in the southern sky.',\n"," 'ALESS CO: A CO survey of spectroscopically-confirmed, ALMA-identified SMGs. The high-redshift galaxies selected at submillimeter wavelengths (SMGs) are amongst the most dusty and active systems in the Universe, with star-formation rates exceeding a few hundred solar masses per year. The fuelling and triggering of their extreme star-formation rates is not well understood, with conflicting models and few observational constraints. Here, we propose a survey of the gas in SMGs, by observing CO in 19 ALMA-identified SMGs with secure rest-frame UV/optical spectroscopic redshifts from the ALESS survey. These observations directly trace the star-formation fuel and will ~double the number of SMGs with high-quality sub-arcsec resolution CO maps. We will use the data to measure the mass and spatial extent of the gas reservoirs in SMGs, properly placing them on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We will also determine whether the prolific star-formation rates are merger-triggered, by measuring the gas dynamics and identifying whether the blends in single-dish surveys are physical associations. Finally, we will use the data to measure the bright-end of the CO luminosity function at high-redshift, which differs by factors of ~10 in different galaxy evolution models.',\n"," 'Probing The Star Burst Phase of Quasar Host Galaxies. Understanding the physical mechanisms and connection between supermassive black hole growth and galaxy formation and evolution remains elusive. In particular, observational properties of host galaxies of distant luminous quasars has remained challenging due to the high contrast needed to separate the bright quasar from the faint, resolved galaxy. We are proposing to observe two carefully selected quasars at a unique stage in their evolution where the host galaxy is undergoing a burst of star formation. In the submm regime we gain the necessary level of contrast to see the light from the host since the energy output from the host galaxy is far greater than due to AGN. Due to high angular resolution of ALMA we will be able to spatially resolve the host galaxy and study several key properties, including molecular gas distributions and masses, dynamical properties from resolved kinematics maps, and host galaxy morphologies. Our ALMA observations will be supplemented with adaptive optics assisted near-IR integral field spectroscopy observations, combining the two will give us a better understanding of the relationship between star formation and AGN activity at these early epochs.',\n"," 'Young Quasars in the Early Universe. In the past decade we have experienced a seven fold increase in the number of high redshift quasars (z>6), most of which were discovered by our team. Observations of these objects show that they already host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) less than 1 Gyr after the Big Bang. The formation and growth of these SMBHs on such short timescales remains an important open question. We recently identified a few quasars with very small proximity zones, which is the region of enhanced transmission around the quasar due to its ionizing radiation, indicating quasar lifetimes of only 0.1 Myr. These objects pose a significant challenge to current black hole formation models, which require much longer lifetimes of almost the entire Hubble time. We have identified six new young quasar candidates and propose to obtain precise systemic redshift measurements from [CII] emission lines, which are crucial to obtain accurate lifetime estimates. The confirmation of six additional young quasars would imply that a significant fraction of the known quasar population is significantly younger than previously expected and thus requires new theoretical models explaining the rapid growth of the SMBHs.',\n"," 'NGC 7582: A case study for the dual effects of AGN feedback and bars on star formation activity. AGN outflows and galactic bars can have an impact on their host galaxy that is difficult to distinguish. NGC 7582 provides an ideal case study for separating out the various mechanisms that may act to either suppress or enhance the efficiency of star formation and the availability of gas throughout the galaxy. Recent MUSE observations reveal clumps of star formation along the leading edge of the bar and a 3 kpc long bi-conical ionized gas outflow, which may be collimated by a central circumnuclear starburst ring. Narrow band wide-field imaging from Magellan/MMTF shows clumps of star formation along the leading edge of each side of the bar and throughout the center of the galaxy. We propose to map NGC 7582 in CO (2-1) observations over a large 3x1 arcminute map at spatial resolution comparable to the MUSE observations. The wide-field high angular resolution observations will provide a spatially resolved map of where the star formation efficiency and gas fraction are enhanced or suppressed relative to both the bar and outflow edges, to determine the relative effect of each mechanism, and the interplay between positive and negative feedback.',\n"," 'Radio jets or morphological quenching: What suppresses star formation in massive galaxies?. We will use ALMA at 3 mm at 1-1.5 beam to probe CO(1-0) in the nearby (z=0.0755) massive spiral galaxy 2MASX J23453268-0449256, which has two giant radio lobes, but no bulge (<10% bulge fraction). This provides us with a rare and precious opportunity to study the gas kinematics in a radio galaxy without potential impact from the most important alternative mechanism discussed in the literature: Morphological quenching has been proposed to inhibit star formation in early-type galaxies simply by stabilizing the ISM through the spherical stellar gravitational potential, without need for feedback. We will compare the gas mass, gas fraction, and depletion time in J2345-0559 with those found in other samples of nearby early-type radio galaxies and galaxies in the field taken from the COLDGASS survey. Does this galaxy fall onto the Schmidt-Kennicutt relationship of ordinary (spiral) star-forming galaxies, or 1-2 orders of magnitudes below, like many nearby radio galaxies? Since we are probing a universal mechanism of galaxy evolution, answering this even for a single spiral galaxy will be a powerful test of the role for AGN feedback in galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Characterizing the nature of a protogalaxy in the primordial Universe (z=7.1) seen by ALMA. In our previous Cycle 1 observations we have detected [CII]158um emission in a star forming galaxy at z=7.1, well within the epoch of reionization. This is the most distant [CII] detection and in a galaxy representative of the galaxy population responsible for the reionization of the Universe. The [CII] line is extremely narrow (8 km/s) and slightly offset (a few kpc) relative to the Lya emissiion; both these features are in very nice agreement with the expectations for the distribution of ionized and cold gas from simulations of primeval galaxies. The system has a modest star formation rate (less than 10 Msun/yr), indeed in the range expected for galaxies contributing to the Universe reionization. The goals of the proposed observations are 1) to map the [CII] emission with much higher angular resolution and verify the expectatinos of models that [CII] should break up into small clumps with sizes of ~1 kpc; 2) obtain a detailed dynamical map to infer the mass distribution of the system; 3) trace the ionized component of the ISM through the [OIII]88um line, which is not affected by IGM absorption, and which is expected to have a smoother and broader distribution than [CII].',\n"," 'Using Hydrogen Recombination-line Masers to Trace Disk and Wind Dynamics in MWC 349A. Disk winds are thought to play a critical role in star birth. As winds extract excess angular momentum from accretion disks, matter in the disk can be transported inward to the star to fuel mass growth. However, the observational evidence of wind carrying angular momentum has been very limited. We propose ALMA observations of a rare hydrogen recombination-line maser object MWC349A. The high signal-to-noise ratios made possible by the maser emission process and high spectral dynamic range of ALMA allow us to constrain the relative astrometry of the maser spots to 0.1 milli-arcsecond precision. By improving relative astrometry by one order of magnitude over the previous SMA and PdBI studies, this project will determine how angular momentum is transfered to the wind within a radius of 25 AU, and inform theoretical models of jets and outflows.',\n"," 'Probing the magneto-ionic medium at the jet base in AGN through Faraday rotation. We apply for 12 hr of ALMA time in the full polarization mode to study the jet magnetization and particle composition in the innermost part of the jets of three AGN at 1 and 2mm. Our band 6 pilot study of 3C273 in Cycle 4 has demonstrated that AGN can exhibit extremely high rotation measures (RM) of > 10^5 rad/m^2 at short mm-wavelengths, which has opened up a new window for studying the magneto-ionic medium in and around the jet base. This gives us an unprecedented opportunity to probe the magnetic fields in the region where the jet first becomes visible and helps us to constrain the jet magnetization. Here we propose to extend the pilot study and look for more cases of high RM in AGN at mm-wavelengths. If such high RM signals are found, we will model the Faraday rotation and frequency-dependent polarization behaviour to distinguish between Faraday rotation happening inside or outside of the emission region. Our numerical simulations show that if the jets are highly magnetized, the RM in the boundary layer of the jet will dominate over the RM within the jet, which allows us to probe the jet magnetization through the RM observations.',\n"," 'The structure and dynamics of the very inner equatorial regions of bipolar planetary nebulae. The shaping mechanism of bipolar planetary nebulae (PNe) has not been fully understood yet. It is clear that the main role in shaping the nebula takes place at its innermost region, where an equatorial density enhancement should be related to the collimation of light and jet-launching from the central star. Appropriately sampling these equatorial condensations at the core of PNe would help determine the shaping mechanism. We request ALMA simultaneous band 7 observations (12CO, 13CO J=3-2 and continuum) of the innermost equatorial regions of 3 extreme bipolar nebulae with rich, tight and structured equatorial condensations. They are excellent candidates for ALMAs current capabilities in a reasonable amount of time: Mz 3, Hen 3-401 and NGC 6302. Our main aim is to use high spatial resolution to detect and map these structures, in order to derive accurate ages and sizes to compare with those of their outflows and determine their role in the shaping of the nebulae. Alternatively, should orbiting disks be found as predicted by models, this would be the first direct detection and mapping of stable disks around planetary nebulae showing well-developed, high-velocity bipolar outflows.',\n"," 'Imaging Extended [CII] Emission at z=6.15 with Compact Array. As one of the brightest atomic coolant lines in the far-infrared, [CII] 158um line is viewed as a reliable star-formation rate (SFR) indicator up to redshift ~ 6 at least. However, certain ALMA observations of gravitationally lensed, intrinsically faint galaxies at z>6 did not yield robust detection of [CII], raising the concern that [C II] could be underluminous in low metallicity environment, or simply being resolved out because of an extended size, 2-3x larger than UV star-forming regions. We request standalone ACA observation of a giant (~10\") Lyman-alpha-emitting arc at z=6.15. With a lensing magnification of ~17, this source could host an intrinsically low SFR down to ~0.6 Msun/yr. Our CASA simulation suggests that previous observations with 12-m array might miss the bulk of extended [CII] emission, which will be detected robustly when combined with the proposed 16-hr ACA observations on-source. Despite being a simple detection experiment, this program will also compare the size/distribution of [CII] emission with those of UV continuum and line width with those of LyA, exploiting the potential of ACA in detecting extended [CII] lines at z>6.',\n"," 'Unvealing the true nature of the subluminous young stellar object Par-Lup3-4. Par-Lup3-4, located close to the brown dwarf limit is an underluminous object for its spectral type which is also accreting. We propose Band 7 observations of CO(3-2) and continuum of Par-Lup3-4 to study the morphology and the physical parameters of the dust and gas disk surrounding the object. These observations will also allow us to confirm the low velocity molecular outflow that was detected recently in previous ALMA band 6 observations. Using the continuum emission from the dust we will measure the spectral index between 1.3 mm (using previous ALMA b6 observations) and 870 microns to probe possible evidence or grain growth inside the disk. Another important goal is to study the kinematics of the disk and estimate the dynamical mass of ParLup3-4, which will reveal the true nature of this object in the limit of the substellar regime. This proposal requesting only 2.17 h time, will provide unique information on the origin of low mass stars close to the brown dwarf boundary.',\n"," 'The first molecular line inventory in hybrid disks. The transition from the late phase of protoplanetary disks to young debris disks remains a poorly explored evolutionary stage of planet-forming disks. The new class of \"hybrid\" disks, recently revealed by our team, includes disks exhibiting debris disk-like dust properties, but having primordial gas content. These disks may represent the protoplanetary to debris disk transition. In order to establish how the physical and chemical properties evolve, we propose to study all four hybrid disks discovered so far, and four evolved Herbig Ae systems with relatively low gas content as comparison targets. The observations will provide the first inventory of the most important molecules in these disks. We will characterize their morphology and kinematics, and perform a detailed chemical analysis using our ANDES and ALCHEMIC chemistry codes adapted to these disks. Our program will reveal the physics of an independent evolutionary path for the gas component around A-type stars. The longer than anticipated survival of gas in hybrid disks will have important consequences for planet formation, providing material for the formation of gaseous planets even after the canonical 10 Myr of evolution.',\n"," 'Mapping the feedback effects on the gas reservoir in a z~1.6 QSO. We have recently reported, based on X-shooter and SINFONI data, the best example of a 10-kpc scale AGN-driven ionised outflow in the z=1.6 obscured QSO XID2028, showing effects of feedback in the host galaxy. For this object we have also evidence of atypically low gas fraction from PdBI data, consistent with a scenario where the gas has been already affected by the effects of the strong QSO feedback. Therefore, this source is the best suited for deep ALMA follow-up observations at a resolution comparable with SINFONI data (0.4\", few kpc in size). With a total of 6.5 hrs of observing time this program: 1) will provide the first, unambiguous observational detection of AGN feedback affecting the gas reservoir of a z~1.5 QSO host galaxy; 2) may provide the first detection of a molecular outflow in the CO transition in a z>1 system. Overall, the observations will maximize the scientific return of ALMA Early Science spatial and spectral capabilities and will provide the missing smoking gun of AGN feedback in action at the peak of AGN/galaxy formation, thus resulting in a crucial step for both theoretical and observational studies of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Mapping Infall in Filamentary Environments: A Study of three Orion Class 0 Protostars. We propose to use the Orion A cloud as a laboratory to study the processes that control low mass star formation by mapping infall in three Class 0 protostars found in dense filaments, each selected to be in a region with different environmental properties. We will adapt an approach used to map infall in massive protostars to low mass protostars, using C18O (2-1) and simultaneolusly obtained 13CO and 12CO lines, to map the acceleration of the infalling gas near the protostar. The interpretation of this acceleration is potentially less model dependent than the red-shifted absorption profiles commonly used in infall measurements. Combined with measurements of the envelope structure from simultaneous dust continuum mapping and Spitzer/Herschel/APEX SEDs, the infall motions will provide the rate of mass infall onto the protostar, and the dependence of mass infall rate on environment. We will use 12 m, ACA and TP observations for this pilot study to identify the minimum data needed for larger surveys of infall. These data will also be compared to a similar Cycle 2 study of Class I protostars to study the evolution of infall between the Class 0 and I phases.',\n"," 'Stimulated AGN feedback in cluster cores. ALMA has revealed that radio AGN drive massive molecular gas flows in galaxies, and has identified a population of slowly moving molecular clouds in massive galaxies that are difficult to understand. Observation indicates these clouds were lifted from the nucleus by rising X-ray bubbles, or the clouds formed in the bubbles updrafts. We propose to test this model using ALMA CO(3-2) and CO(1-0) observations of two brightest cluster galaxies harbouring powerful radio AGN, molecular gas masses exceeding ten billion solar masses, and star formation rates of up to 140 solar masses per year. The results will yield new and significant developments in our understanding of radio-mode feedback, which is common to all elliptical galaxies and may drive their evolution.',\n"," 'Molecular observations of the AGN Torus in Cygnus A. We propose path-finder observations to detect CO emission from the archetype powerful radio galaxy, Cygnus A. The immediate goal is to make a first measurement of the CO luminosity of the recently discovered torus region. Cygnus A, at a redshift of 0.0564, provides a unique laboratory to study the detailed physical processes in high (quasar-like), luminosity AGN right in our own backyard! We have discovered a structure in the nucleus of Cygnus A which may be free-free emission from the long-sought circumnuclear torus. The key to understanding this structure is to image the molecular gas and dust in the multi-phase, obscuring torus. Unfortunately, to date, no detection has been made of molecular emission from Cygnus A, although the existing limits are poor. In our path-finder observations, we will perform a search for CO emission at a resolution adequate to isolate the toroidal region, but not over-resolve any potential emission. These results will be used to plan high resolution imaging of the torus, to determine the dynamics and physical conditions in this unique AGN laboratory.',\n"," 'Delving Deeper into PKS 1510-089. We propose using phased ALMA as part of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) to image the polarized emission emanating from the gamma-ray bright blazar PKS 1510-089 in an effort to discern whether the jet is magnetically disordered or ordered on the micro arcsecond scales probed by VLBI at 1 mm. PKS 1510-089, along with a number of other blazars, has exhibited prominent orphan gamma-ray flaring behavior that can be explained by disordered turbulence in the jet spine or inverse-Compton scattering of photons emanating from regions of ordered magnetic field in the jet sheath. Determining the nature of the magnetic field within PKS 1510-089 using the high resolution (and sensitivity) afforded by a phased ALMA in concert with the EHT will help discriminate between models of blazar emission that have been developed to explain this high-energy variability.',\n"," 'Identifying targets for cross-checking blackhole mass measurements. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are key to understanding galaxy evolution, but the SMBH mass-central velocity dispersion relation is based on a relatively small number of measurements and a handful of methods. It is straightforward to measure the mass of SMBHs in the ALMA era, by probing the near-Keplerian rotation of CO disks around them. This method has been demonstrated in recent years. In order to further compare the SMBH mass measured by CO kinematics with other methods, we propose this 7-m ACA proposal to find suitable targets for subsequent higher resolution follow-up. We select targets with regular dust disks (from HST imaging) and robust masses from other methods. We request low spatial resolution CO(2-1) imaging of 9 galaxies. We aim to quantify their molecular gas content, thus identifying the best targets for SMBH measurements at higher resolution, and 2) as a byproduct, study the abundance and kinematics of molecular gas and look for suitable targets for follow-up resolved observations of giant molecular clouds.',\n"," 'X marks the spot: outflow-infall interaction in B335. We propose to observe the central region of the isolated Class 0 prototar B335 with a 7-point mosaic in Band 6 with an angular resolution of 0.8\", which corresponds to spatial scales of <100 AU at the source distance, to obtain detailed information on the physical and dynamical properties of the infalling circumstellar envelope and of the outflow-infall interaction. Our final goal is to highlight the interaction between the outflow and the accreting envelope close to the protostar, where outflows could actually reverse and end the infall of material, preventing further growth of the central protostar. This will give insights into the important role that the outflow-envelope interaction plays in the mass-assembling process and in determining the final mass of the forming star. Different outflow and high-density tracers (12CO, 13CO, C18O, H2CO, 13CS and CH3OH), together with the continuum, will be observed to probe different density and kinematic regimes, trace the morphology and kinematics of the outflows, the physical properties of the outflow cavity walls and the impact of the outflow on the envelope, and the distribution of the infalling gas and its interaction with the outflow.',\n"," 'Investigating a Young, Extreme High-Mass Star-Forming Region. We have recently observed G23.33-0.30, an extremely energetic high-mass star-forming region, with the Green Bank Telescope. This source contains the brightest NH3(3,3) maser ever detected, probably generated by a powerful outflow, and the largest NH3 line widths detected outside of the Galactic Center. G23.33-0.30 coincides with an infrared dark cloud and CORNISH detects no HII region near its position. Given G23.33-0.30s large thermal line widths, bright NH3(3,3) maser, suspected high velocity outflows, and nondetected H II region, this likely indicates that G23.33-0.30 is an extremely massive young stellar object in a very energetic early evolutionary stage. High-mass stars pose the largest challenges, both observationally and theoretically, thus the study of this source will shed light on the formation of the most massive stars in the Galaxy. To study G23.33-0.30s core-scale kinematics and outflows, we request 2 hours in the C40-2 configuration at Band 6.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas in the Nearest, Extremely Low-Metallicity, Star Forming Galaxy, Leo P. Leo P is the most extremely low metallicity (Z = 0.03 Zsun), low-mass (M_HI = 1x10^6 Msun) star forming galaxies in the nearby universe (D = 1.72 Mpc). The proximity of Leo P affords us the best opportunity to constrain recent star formation models in such an extremely low-metallicity environment in comparison to much more distant objects such as I Zw 18 (D = 18.2 Mpc). We propose to observe the 115 GHz CO (J=1-0) emission in Leo P with a single-pointing observation requiring 5.51 hours (including overhead) of ALMA time. These observations will help to constrain recent star formation models at low metallicity which suggest molecular gas may not be required to form stars. Regardless of a detection or a non-detection, this observation will put valuable constraints on the CO luminosity and its relationship to other star formation tracers such as L_Halpha, L_B, stellar mass, and total HI mass as well as provide important insight into the low metallicity star formation process prevalent in the early universe.',\n"," 'Star Formation and the Turbulent Interstellar Medium of Lyman Break Galaxy Analogs. A major challenge for studies of galaxy evolution is understanding the details of star formation in key populations at all redshifts. While Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z>3 have been studied extensively, their dense gas reservoirs remain poorly understood due to limited sensitivity and resolution. Exploiting the proximity of z~0.2 LBG analogs (LBAs) and close engagement with theory, we propose to obtain 0.2\" resolution CO(3-2) line observations to address three key questions that are difficult or impossible to tackle directly at high redshift. First, we will analyze LBAs molecular gas kinematics to assess whether gravitational instability or star formation feedback drives the turbulence that dictates the collapse of clouds to form new stars. Second, we will determine whether and how LBAs diverge from the global and resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation seen in ordinary star-forming galaxies at z=0. Third, we will investigate whether and how shocks and star formation feedback impact the molecular gas reservoirs of LBAs.',\n"," 'The disks around low-mass stars in the solar neirborhood. Debris disks are signposts of successful planet formation in some stars. Several years of studies have revealed a broad population of evolved disks. This population shows a clear decrement in the frequency of disks towards later spectral type stars. The origin of this trend is not clear, but evidence suggests there is a segregated evolutionary path that might depend on the stellar mass/temperature. M-stars are the most abundant stellar objects in the Galaxy but the fraction of M-stars harboring warm debris disk seems to be very low, while complete surveys looking for the cold debris disks are not complete yet. Here we propose to observe a small sample of M-stars in the Solar neighborhood, all showing clear signs of harboring circumstellar material. We will use the ACA standalone to detect the cold component of debris disks around nearby M-stars, in order to determine the amount of dusty material present around the dwarfs and, this way, to constrain the formation and evolution of the very close M-stars population.',\n"," 'The Nature of the Central Disk in V Hya: A Carbon Star Ejecting High-Velocity Bullets. The carbon star V Hya is experiencing heavy mass loss as it undergoes the transition from an AGB star to a bipolar planetary nebula (PN), and is possibly the earliest object known in this brief phase, which is so short that few nearby stars are likely to be caught in the act. Our STIS/HST data show a 25-yr history of high-velocity (>200 km/s) bullet-like ejections from the star. SMA CO observations with ~3.5\" resolution also reveal an extended high-velocity, collimated outflow (aligned E-W) and a N-S elongated dense waist (size 8\" in CO 3-2) on ~100-250 yr timescales. Our coronagraphic polarimetric imaging at 1 micron shows an inclined disk of size 0.6\" (or 240 AU) at the center of the waist. We propose to observe the CO J=3-2 line and 0.87 mm dust continuum in V Hya at 0.1\" resolution to (a) determine whether this disk is rotating or expanding, and to constrain its mass, (b) study CO bullets close to the central source. These observations offer us an unprecedented opportunity to test binary interaction models for making the jet engines that launch the jet-like outflows that produce bipolar PNe outflows, and the disks that are the launch-sites of these outflows.',\n"," 'Unveiling the merging substructures of a high-z cluster mapping their Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. ClJ0152-1357 is a massive z=0.834 non-virialized galaxy cluster characterized by a complex combination of several merging subclumps observed in many spectral bands. Thanks to its high redshift, high mass, electron temperature and density, and the merging directions apparently lying on the plane of the sky, it is a representative target to investigate the interacting substructures in a cluster in the early stages of its evolution. Our 18 GHz ATCA observations (Massardi et al. 2010), limited to the region of the most massive subclump, showed that the peak of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal is significantly displaced from the X-ray peak possibly as a consequence of major mergings of the subclumps. The combination of X-ray and SZ mapping at comparable resolutions can disentangle the temperature and the density distributions and retrieve a detailed picture of the ISM. Henceforth, we propose Band 4 (at the maximum of the negative SZ peak) ACA standalone observations to map to ~10 arcsec resolution (comparable to that of the available XMM-Newton images) the whole cluster region, to unveil the subclump properties and reconstruct models of the substructure interactions.',\n"," 'Low Mass Protostellar Outflows: An Efficient Legacy Survey. Bipolar molecular outflows may be the dominant factor determining the initial mass function by extracting angular momentum and then dispersing the parent dense gas core.

We will survey all embedded protostars of Chamaeleon, Ophiuchus, Aquila, Cor Aus, and Serpens from Dunham et al 2015. We will map 125 sources covering the full class 0 and I and the early class II Young Stellar Objects. We will use a single Band 6 spectral correlator setup to observe CO and other lines tracing the molecular outflow material, jet, envelope and disk gas on spatial scales of 150 to 2000 au with 1\" angular resolution. In addition, we will obtain sensitive 7.5 GHz Band 6 continuum images with 0.1\" angular resolution to determine YSO multiplicity and measure associated protoplanetary disks. These proposal will increase by a factor of 15 the early work done by Arce & Sargent (2006) to measure variation of outflow opening angle with age, and be the first complete census of nearby bipolar outflows with ALMA.

Understanding the early evolution of high mass star formation is one of the major open topics in star formation research. To investigate this, we propose to map a massive star forming filament within the G10.3-0.1 complex in band 6 and 7 with both 12m array and ACA. The clumps on the filament are in different evolutionary stages--from a potential starless clump to ultracompact HII regions--gives us exceptional opportunity to study key parameters as a function of the evolutionary stage (i.e., time). The main scientific goals are: a)Resolve the clumps down to 0.009pc to investigate how exactly the fragmentation proceeds from less evolved to more evolved clumps, such as the fragment masses and separations, and compare the results with Jeans and turbulent fragmentation theories. b)Investigate the radial density profile of each resolved core, and establish whether it changes as a function of the evolutionary stages of the cores. c) Investigate the deuterium fraction (N(N2D+)/N(N2H+)) characteristics between the onset of gravititional collapse and more evolved stages. d)Study the kinematics of the high-mass star forming complex, investigate the global collapse from clump to core scale.',\n"," 'Molecular gas content of EXTREME outliers from the star-forming main sequence at z~1.5. It is currently unclear as to whether the most rapidly star-forming galaxies operate in a mode of star formation dissimilar from that of the majority that populate the so-called Main Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies. Two scenarios are commonly considered. In one of them, the sudden accumulation at the bottom of the potential well of a large amount of gas triggered by a major merger (or by a disk instability) is boosting a highly efficient conversion of gas into stars. Alternatively, MS outliers may form stars in the same mode (i.e. efficiency) as MS galaxies, but just happen to be exceptionally gas rich. With the remarkable sensitivity of ALMA, we can now directly test this by determining whether the star formation efficiency (=LIR/LCO) is statistically different from that of MS galaxies. A new ‘intensive’ near-infrared spectroscopic survey of over 2000 star-forming galaxies in COSMOS with 1.2 < z < 1.7 using Subaru/FMOS is enabling us to identify a robust sample of galaxies detected by Hershel/PACS and having extreme offsets from the MS. We propose to use ALMA to obtain CO measurements for such galaxies with accurate spectroscopic redshifts and SFRs based on Hα and FIR luminosity. These ALMA observations will nicely complement published CO studies of main-sequence galaxies and lay the groundwork for future (sub)mm studies of such extreme events including those at higher spatial resolution.',\n"," 'Who Stirs the Pot? Dynamics of Edge-On Debris Disks. The tenuous, dusty debris disks around main sequence stars are hallmarks of substantial reservoirs of large planetesimals. The dynamical state of debris disks is central to our understanding of their masses, grain size distribution, and collisional evolution -- as well as the presence or absence of large bodies \"stirring\" the planetesimal belts. Edge-on debris disks present a unique opportunity to access dynamics, since the vertical scale height encodes the velocity dispersion and the total mass of any perturbing bodies. Millimeter wavelengths are uniquely suited for revealing the dynamical state of debris disks, since the large grains are not subject to the excitatory effects of stellar radiation that puff up the vertical scale height at optical and infrared wavelengths. Here we propose to measure the vertical scale height of the debris belts around the two brightest, most prominent nearby edge-on systems: beta Pic and AU Mic. The observations will reveal whether the collision velocities are destructive or erosive, and will be sensitive to perturbing masses as low as 2 and 5 earth masses in AU Mic and beta Pic, respectively -- potentially revealing the presence of Neptune-mass planets at large distances from these young stars.',\n"," 'Mapping the water megamasers in the Circinus Galaxy. Water megamasers provide the best means of probing the physical conditions and accurate geometries within less than 1 pc of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Sub-millimeter water masers allow us to investigate with unprecedented detail the accretion disk and map so far uncharted regions. This is only now possible thanks to the superior sensitivity and resolution that ALMA provides. We propose here a sensinsitive observation of the sub-millimeter water maser lines at 183, 321, 325 and 658 GHz towards the Circinus galaxy, which is the nearest AGN hosting powerful pc-scale maser disk. Both the 183 and 321 GHz lines were previously detected with ALMA, but have never so far been resolved. The detection and imaging of all these lines will give us an entirely new insight into the kinematics and physical state of the accreting material that is within the sphere of influence of the supermassive black hole at the center. An analysis of the strength and distribution will allow us to : i) map the gas temperature and density to very high angular resolution, ii) improve our geometric disk models, iii) test unification schemes and iv) constrain radiative transfer models.',\n"," 'Can high velocity winds drive molecular outflows in main-sequence galaxies?. Outflows are a central element of galaxy evolution models. Observed ionised gas outflows are ubiquitous, but can the winds that drive them also launch outflows of cold, star-forming gas? We request 13 hours to map CO(1-0) in 16 main-sequence galaxies (0.02',\n"," 'Disorder vs. Order: Discerning the nature of the magnetic field in PKS 1510-089. We propose using a combined ALMA+GMVA array to map the polarized emission emanating from the gamma-ray bright blazar PKS 1510-089 in an effort to discern whether the jet is magnetically disordered or ordered on the pc-scales probed by VLBI at 86 GHz. PKS 1510-089, along with a number of other blazars, has exhibited prominent orphan gamma-ray flaring behavior that can be explained by disordered turbulence in the jet spine or inverse-Compton scattering of photons emanating from regions of ordered magnetic field in the jet sheath. Determining the nature of the magnetic field within PKS 1510-089 using the high resolution (and sensitivity) afforded by a phased ALMA in concert with the GMVA will help discriminate between models of blazar emission that have been developed to explain this high-energy variability.',\n"," 'Mapping the Dense and Shocked Gas at 100 pc Scales in the Nuclear Regions of the Antennae galaxies. Dynamical interactions and mergers of two gas-rich galaxies can result in galaxies bright in IR luminosity. Numerical simulations have predicted the ubiquitous presence of large scale central gas inflow that leads to central gas accumulation and subsequent starburst activity. As a first step toward better understanding the process that leads to IR-bright starburst activities in nearby systems, we have been leading an extensive program to study the nearest gas-rich intermediate stage merger, the Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/9). Using the SMA and ALMA Science Verification data, we found kinematical evidence that suggest radial inflow of gas into the nucleus in NGC 4039 and high CO(3-2)/(1-0) ratios in both nuclear regions suggesting higher excitation there. While the CO emission is extremely useful to study the overall molecular gas mass and the gross kinematics, it does not provide a quantitative measure of the dense/shocked gas that are directly related to star formation activity. Here we thus propose a total of 1.4 hours to image both nuclear regions of the Antennae galaxies in the 5 dense/shocked gas at 100 pc scales in Band 3. We will probe the most active dusty star forming regions using 3 dense gas tracers (HCN, HCO+, CN), and examine their relation to the stellar potential and star formation activities traced in multi-wavelength images. We will also investigate whether the distribution of the shocked gas (SiO, CH3OH) shows correlation with the region where the CO velocity field shows significant deviations form circular motion and determine the origin of large-scale molecular shocks using the SiO/CH3OH ratio.',\n"," 'Tracing molecular outflows with [CI] at high redshift. Carbon monoxide (CO) is widely used as a tracer of the molecular gas in almost all types of environments. However, shocks and photoionisation from AGN radiation field may destroy CO molecules, dissociating them into atomic carbon, while leaving the underlying H2 unaffected. Therefore, neutral carbon emission may be a good, and potentially even better, alternative to CO as a tracer of AGN-driven outflows. We propose here an exploratory programme to observe the [CI](3P1 - 3P0) fine structure line in one of the most luminous QSO at z~2. If this pilot project proves to be successful at detecting and measuring the molecular outflow of the selected QSO we will extend this investigation to a large sample, by conducting the first survey of atomic carbon in a statistically-significant sample of high-z AGN host galaxies.',\n"," 'Understanding star formation in the swept-up ring around the RCW 36 HII region. When feedback from high-mass stars disperses a cloud, it can simultaneously also create dense rings of swept-up gas that can form stars. Currently it is unclear which physical processes regulate the star formation activity in these rings and how this affects the star formation activity and outcome in these rings. Here we propose to map the full swept-up ring around the RCW 36 HII region with 7m compact array observations that cover dust continuum, protostellar outflow, temperature and dense gas tracers. The observations will determine the triggered star formation activity of the full ring and evaluate its relative contribution to the total cluster. Additionally, the different observed lines and archival data will allow to study the different support terms (thermal, turbulent and magnetic) and inflow in the ring and cores to propose a comprehensive scenario to explain the observed star formation activity. Lastly, the proposed observations can support archival data to probe the relative magnetic field orientations from the cloud down to the 0.03 pc scale.',\n"," 'ALMA band-7 survey in the HUDF: Slicing the properties of the faintest dusty galaxies through cosmic time. One of the most important results of the deep field mm continuum surveys in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) has been the measurement of an unexpected but clear flattening of the cumulative 1.2-mm continuum number counts at faint flux levels (<0.1 mJy). This implies that most of the cosmic cold dust reservoirs are finally being accounted, with most of the galaxies located at z<3. Here, we aim to capitalize on these findings, by obtaining a deep 870um dust continuum map over the HUDF down to an rms of 45uJy. Aside from having a unparalleled legacy value, these observations will (1) measure the faint-end slope of the number counts independently at 870um, providing insights on the reasons behind this flattening (are faint galaxies just dust poor? differences in metallicities?); (2) study the dust properties of individually detected galaxies; (3) provide an independent estimate of the dust-obscured cosmic SFR density, which can be compared to cosmic molecular gas density estimates; (4) Provide constraints on the dust temperatures at z>3 through stacking, informing IRX-beta/stellar mass relationships.',\n"," 'LiH - a probe of Galactic Li evolution and the lithium problems. Li abundances of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prediction and meteorites are not consistent with the ones measured in old metal-poor stars and in current Solar atmosphere, respectively. These discrepancies are the long-standing \"cosmological lithium problem\" and \"lithium problem in the Sun\", which plague our current understanding of cosmology, stellar evolution, and Galactic chemical evolution. Here we propose to use ALMA to observe LiH (J=1-0) in the Milky Way toward two interestellar clouds. The determination of the interstellar Li abundance, along with the stellar Li distribution in our galaxy derived from the upcoming Gaia DR2 data, will allow us to understand the Galactic Li evolution and shed light on the lithium problems.',\n"," 'A survey of the [NII]205 um / [CII]ratio at z=1. We propose to use ALMA band 9 to observe the [NII]205 um transition in 5 galaxies at z=1.2 from which we have detected emission in the [CII]158 um line. The [CII] transition is emitted by molecular gas ionized and heated by stellar UV radiation, and in the ALMA era promises to be a crucial workhorse in high redshift surveys. The [NII]205 um line is a sensitive tracer of ionized gas, and complements the [CII] line as a star formation diagnostic. We will use the [NII] line to measure the fraction of the ISM in these galaxies that has been ionized by stellar radiation, and use this to determine the intensity of the starburst. We will also use the [NII] line, compared with the continuum emission, to trace the hardness of the UV field, thereby determining the spectral type of the most massive stars or inferring the presence of an AGN. Finally, we will use the [NII]/[CII] ratio to determine how much of the measured [CII] arises from ionized gas rather than PDRs. These observations will be an essential reference for future ALMA high-z [CII] studies. This project is a resubmission of a highly ranked cycle 1 project (carried over to cycle 2) with updated source list.',\n"," 'WISDOM: From (Giant) Molecular Clouds to Supermassive Black Holes. Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are key to understand galaxy evolution, but the SMBH mass-central velocity dispersion relation underpinning our understanding is based on a relatively small number of measurements and a handful of methods. We have shown that it is straightforward to estimate the mass of SMBHs in the ALMA era, by probing the near-Keplerian rotation of molecular disks around them at high angular resolution. As part of mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM), we have identified numerous promising targets from high resolution (0.1\") dust imaging with HST, and hereby request low spatial resolution (5.4\") CO(2-1) imaging of 21 galaxies across the Hubble sequence. We aim to 1) quantify their molecular gas content, thus identifying the best targets for SMBH measurements at higher resolution, and 2) study the properties of the spatially-resolved molecular cloud populations analogously to the local universe, where constraining the diffuse emission is essential. Our work will revolutionise studies of the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies, and systematically probe molecular cloud properties in the central bulge-dominated regions of many galaxies.',\n"," 'Characterizing Substructure in the TW Hya Disk. Theoretical models for the early stages of planet formation make predictions for the evolution of solids in protoplanetary disks that conflict with resolved mm-wavelength data. Calculations of inward migration rates for mm/cm-sized particles are much too high to account for the extended emission that is routinely observed. The nominal solution for this problem is to invoke small-scale substructure in the disk, which can trap particles in local concentrations. Such inhomogeneities may be caused by embedded planets, magnetic structures, hydrodynamic instabilities, or turbulent fluctuations. In any case, this substructure is absolutely fundamental to the planet formation process. We propose sensitive, very high angular resolution Band 7 continuum observations to find and characterize this substructure in the closest protoplanetary disk, around TW Hya. This disk is the only case where we can resolve low-amplitude features as small as 2 AU, sufficient to measure planetary gaps on scales compatible with our Solar System architecture and to probe turbulent fluctuations with sizes comparable to the gas pressure scale height over most of the disk volume.',\n"," 'Connecting the black hole shadow and jet base in M87. The supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the heart of the Virgo A galaxy (M87) powers one of the most well-studied relativistic jets in the sky. Due to its high mass and close proximity, M87 shows the shadow cast by the BH event horizon, and promises successful imaging of the jet launching mechanism with unprecedented detail. We propose 3 tracks of Band 6 VLBI observations with the EHT+ALMA VLBI array. The array improvements from Cycle 4 to Cycle 8 (inclusion of KP and NOEMA, together with a further optimized GLT) enhance the angular resolution and sensitivity. By accumulating multi-epoch imaging over multiple years, we can further refine the shadow feature both in total intensity and polarization. It will enable new tests of general relativity (GR) and models of powerful jet launching from a spinning BH with highly magnetized accretion flows. The observations will be accompanied by complementary (requested) 3mm observations with the GMVA+ALMA, together with a multi-band campaign including X and gamma rays up to the TeV regime. Ultimately, we aim to connect the smallest objects predicted by Einsteins GR to galactic-scale outflows that impact large-scale structures in the Universe.',\n"," 'Structure of the beta Pictoris disk in mm dust. We propose to image the brightest debris disk - beta Pictoris - with ALMA in band 7. The primary aim is to study the distribution of mm-size dust on scales from ~150AU down to ~10AU. This will enable us to delineate the location of the colliding planetesimals which are the ultimate cause of the debris cascade in such disks. This will be compared with the distribution of small grains seen in scattered light, the hot dust seen in the mid-IR and the location of the planet beta Pictoris b, in order to test existing models and improve our understanding of the archetype debris disk. The images will probe the mm-grain population of structures including the 100AU ring, outer disk, inner clumps and warp or inclined disk. Simultaneously we will be performing a deep search for emission from the circumstellar CO in the disk, probing the origin of the gas and the nature of the parent planetesimals.',\n"," 'Anatomy of a Fried Egg. IRAS 17163-3907 was recently identified %by Lagadec et al (2011) as the closest and brightest Yellow Hypergiant. Infrared imaging of the dust emission implies a very intense mass-loss, with 2-4~Msun of gas ejected in the last 500 years. This led to the formation of at least two concentric dusty shells. This makes IRAS~17163 a unique object for the study of the mass-loss process in a spectacular short-lived phase towards the end of the life of a massive star, before it explodes as a supernova. Our Cycle 2 proposal to observe it was accepted, but only compact array observations were taken, enabling us to discover the formation of a swept-up ISM bubble around this Yellow Hypergiant.We propose to complete our observations and study these shells in CO J=2-1 emission with ALMA, to probe the kinematics and morphology of the gas in this massive stellar envelope. This will enable us to measure the amount of gas ejected, the time scale of the ejection and check whether the dust and gas ejection are coupled. These measurements are the key for understanding the physics of the intense mass loss during this short-lived, and thus rare, phase of stellar evolution.',\n"," 'Understanding AGN feedback with gas chemistry in NGC 1266. NGC1266 is an early-type galaxy in the southern sky that has recently been shown to be expelling its molecular gas through a large AGN-driven molecular outflow. In this proposal we aim to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the ISM in the central few hundred parsecs of this extraordinary galaxy. We propose to conduct an unbiased line-survey of the 3mm band, using chemical tracers in the ISM to investigate the mechanism driving the molecular gas from this galaxy, and thus more generally constrain how star-formation can be quenched by AGN feedback as galaxies move onto the red sequence. Our data will be the deepest and highest velocity resolution line survey ever conducted in an early-type galaxy, enabling us to explore in depth the astrochemistry in high-metallicity and alpha-element enhanced environments, as well as sheding light on the mechanisms responsible for AGN feedback.',\n"," 'Dust in the disk and wind launching region of TMC1A. In this proposal we aim to unambigiously detect dust in an outflow for the first time. Dusty MHD disk winds have long been suggested, but have never been directly observed. We recently presented a study of the Class I object TMC1A, where we report the first resolved images ever of an outflow launching region (Bjerkeli et al., 2016). These observations demonstrate that the gas in the outflow from TMC1A is launched from the disk surface out to radii of 20 au from the central protostar. Interesting features are, however, also detected in the dust continuum towards the disk. The goal of this project is to further characterize the dust in the disk and to unambiguously detect dust in continuum in the outflow cavity walls close to the protostar. We will use ALMA in its largest configuration, with 16 km baselines, to attain the highest possible spatial resolution. This study will put strong constraints on both the dust content of outflows and subsequently the initial conditions for planet formation.',\n"," 'The nature of the brightest submm galaxies. Recent submm interferometric studies with ALMA and SMA of bright submm sources from single-dish bolometer surveys have hinted that about 60% of the brightest sources (850um fluxes > 8mJy) actually represent blends of ~2-4 fainter SMGs. Corrected for this blending, the interferometric counts of SMGs show a sharp drop above S870~8mJy which implies a fundamental limit to the maximum star-formation rate in galaxies. Moreover, the level of blending observed is inconsistent with the faint SMGs being simply line-of-sight projections, instead a significant fraction of these SMGs must be physically associated with the brightest SMGs. However, the current ALMA/SMA studies comprise just ~40 submm sources and so we propose ALMA Band 7 continuum snapshots of 160 brightest (>8mJy) sources from a new SCUBA-2 survey of the 2-sq. deg COSMOS field. These observations of a statistically significant sample will allow us to better define the knee in the counts to understand its physical significance for galaxy formation, as well as reliably determine the excess of the secondary SMGs (>1mJy) and test the physical association of these faint SMGs with the brighter SMGs.',\n"," 'Investigating the dyncamics of a thermal starless core in the Orion A cloud.. We have discovered a thermal (dv=0.2 km/s) starless NH3 core surrounded by CCS emission in the Orion A Cloud. Although molecular clouds (cores) are generally non-thermally supported in the Orion A cloud, turbulence is almost completely dissipated in this dense object. A striking resemblance to the collapsing starless core L1544 in Taurus suggests that this core is on the verge of star formation. The JVLA observations in NH3 (4\" resolution) revealed that there are clumpy structures within the NH3 core. Because revealing initial conditions of star formation is quite essential to study how the stellar mass is determined, how multiple star systems are formed, how protoplanetary disks are formed, it is of great interest to know how this core is fragmented and evolves into protostars. We propose to map this core in 3 mm dust continuum emission to scrutinize the mass distribution in detail at 1.5\" spatial resolution. We also aim to observe the N2H+ (1-0) and CH3OH (2-1) lines, simultaneously. The observation of the molecular lines with 0.098 km/s velocity resolution will allow us to investigate details of fragmentation process and the dynamical state of the dense cold condensations.',\n"," 'Resolving the emission of phosphorus carriers in a protosolar analog. Phosphorus is a key bioelement on Earth, yet there are very few astrophysical constraints on phosphorus carriers during star formation. We recently detected bright PO and PN emission towards the low-mass protostar B1-a with the IRAM 30m telescope, offering a rare opportunity to characterize the phosphorus carriers in a protosolar analog. We aim to follow up these detections in Bands 3 and 4 of ALMA, covering multiple PO and PN transitions with a spatial resolution of 1\". We will determine the origin of the PO and PN emission within the protostar, map their abundances and excitation temperatures, use molecular tracers to explore the phosphorus chemistry, and make comparisons with the early Solar system phosphorus abundances. This project will provide valuable new insight into how a crucial bioelement is inherited in an analog to the Solar nebula.',\n"," 'The physical nature of massive quenched galaxies at z>3.5. Determining why galaxies stop converting gas into stars is a key unanswered question of galaxy evolution. Multiple processes could play a role in quenching a galaxy, yet evidence is scarce to favor one explanation over the other. Using NIR spectra, we recently discovered quiescent galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, with properties that models fail to predict. Studying these systems further is necessary to understand the first appearance of quiescent galaxies in the Universe, and give constraints on the quenching models. We propose dust continuum and [CI] observation with ALMA for the spectroscopically confirmed massive quenched galaxies at z > 3.5. Deep dust continuum imaging at Band-7 will enable us to investigate whether these red and massive galaxies have strongly dust-obscured star-formation or are truly quenched. We will also conduct deep [CI] spectroscopy at Band-3 to investigate their cold gas fractions, which will allow us to disentangle the quenching processes with different timescales. These data will provide us with deep insights into how galaxies stop star formation and massive quenched galaxies first appear in the early Universe.',\n"," 'Dissecting a colossus: confronting recent theory with a multi-merging HyLIRG. Recent Spitzer and Herschel results have highlighted the importance of Sub-Millimeter Galaxies (SMGs) for studies of galaxy formation and evolution: SMGs contribute significantly to the total star formation in the early universe. Amongst these SMGs, only a handful are hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs; > 10^13 solar luminosities in the IR). For a standard IMF, a HyLIRG hosts a staggering star formation rate of > 10,000 solar masses per year for a very short (Myrs) period. We have identified an ultra-rare system of two merging HyLIRGs at redshift 2.41: HATLAS J084933.4-021443, alias g09h124. This source is an excellent system to confront current theory and showcase ALMAs scientific capabilities. Here we request less than 4 hours of ALMA time to obtain resolved kinematics/dynamics of several lines including the CO ladder, water vapor emission lines, CI, OH+, HCN, HNC, HCO+ and plus associated dust continuum emission. Our principal goals include (a) determining resolved kinematics and physical conditions of both HyLIRGs; (b) measuring kinematic and luminosity based masses of the different gas components, thus constraining star formation scenarios; (c) constraining the radiation field and the presence of AGNs; (d) constraining the presence and mass of outflows and winds; (e) calibrating gas masses derived from different emission lines, and (f) comparing the observational results to the most recent hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. This economical program is well suited for ALMA Cycle 1, and will produce immediate scientific results which will also be useful in designing ours, and others, large Cycle 2 programs on SMGs.',\n"," 'Do counter-rotating stellar discs promote black hole fuelling?. Accretion of external gas often produces stellar discs that counter rotate with respect to the main body of the galaxy. Numerical simulations predict that these counter-rotating discs will promote gas inflows to the central ~400pc of the galaxy, which may then fuel the black hole. We propose a pilot study to test this prediction. Using ALMA observations of CO(1-0) to trace the velocity and distribution of the cold molecular gas, we will determine if galaxies with counter-rotating discs show: 1) a higher molecular gas mass in their nuclei when compared with galaxies without counter-rotation; 2) dynamical evidence for gas inflow towards the black hole. If these two features are observed, it will indicate that external accretion events can provide the necessary conditions to fuel the black hole. Our pilot study will provide significant insight on how black hole activity has been triggered and fuelled for the past Gyr, an issue that remains unresolved in studies of black hole and galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Characterizing the Circum-Planetary Disk of GSC 6214-210 b with ALMA. Circum-planetary disks are natural outcomes of giant planet formation but are observationally difficult to study. Fortunately, a handful of wide-separation planetary-mass companions (PMCs) below 15 Mjup have recently been discovered from direct imaging planet searches, enabling a detailed look at the atmospheres and environments of young gas giants for the first time. We propose ALMA 870 um continuum observations of the 14 +/- 2 Mjup companion GSC 6214-210 b, the only young (5-10 Myr), wide-separation (330 AU, or 2.2\") PMC known to harbor a circum-planetry disk based on accretion activity and thermal IR excess. Planet scattering will severely truncate these disks, so measuring the dust mass for GSC 6214-210 b will allow us to discriminate in situ formation via either disk instability or turbulent fragmentation versus dynamical scattering to a wide orbit following formation closer in. Our 5-sigma detection goal of 1.8 Lunar masses can be achieved in 11 min of on-source integration time (41 min total) with ALMA. Altogether, these observations will provide the first insight into the origin of the growing population of gas giants being found on extreme orbits beyond 100 AU.',\n"," 'The Birth of Super Star Clusters at 0.5 Parsec Resolution. Our recently delivered B7 mosaic of the central regions of NGC 253 at 1.6 pc resolution uncovers highly-structured bright emission and a number of compact sources that have all the markings of nascent very massive star clusters (super star clusters). These objects are very bright in continuum and HCN 4-3, possess dynamical masses of approximately a million solar masses, and are unresolved in our 1.6 pc resolution data. We propose to obtain 0.5 pc resolution data in the central field encompassing these objects, with enough sensitivity to ensure their detection and conclusively measure their sizes and kinematics. These measurements will allow us not only to obtain accurate masses and determine the structure of these objects, but also to study feedback signatures and processes that may stop their growth. In particular we will look for the imprint of strong radiative feedback by estimating FIR optical depths from dust surface brightness and comparing them to local kinematics from high S/N line profiles. NGC 253 is the best source to carry out these high spatial resolution observations.',\n"," 'Constraining Ionization in a Diverse Sample of Protoplanetary Disks. Ionization is influential in shaping both physical and chemical structure in protoplanetary disks. However, ionization is poorly constrained in observed disks, with strong constraints towards only one source, TW Hya. In this disk, it was found that ionization from cosmic rays is suppressed by two orders of magnitude, implying that coupling of disk material to magnetic fields may be too weak to explain angular momentum transport in this system. We propose a survey of ionization-tracing molecular ions towards seven physically well-characterized disks that will complement existing observations in the ALMA archive to place constraints on ionization in a diverse disk sample. In addition to verifying whether or not the low ionization levels observed in TW Hya are typical, the proposed observations will have implications for the cold ionization-driven chemistry occurring in these disks, which governs the formation of water and complex organics, and will additionally supply realistic, observationally motivated ionization models for future disk physical modeling, namely magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.',\n"," 'Molecular tracers of hidden AGN: Spatially resolved chemistry in Circinus. Recent studies reveal that a significant fraction of the AGN population may be undetected in X-rays surveys because of the extreme obscuration. Molecular emission in the mm/submm can penetrate large columns of dust and gas and probe the inner regions of Compoton-thick AGNs. The HCO+/HCN line ratio has been proposed to trace AGN activity but it is not clear if it is regulated by X-ray chemistry or shocks. Also, recent observation in obscured luminous infrared galaxies have shown that other species, such as vibrationally excited HCN and HC3N may be better tracers of obscured AGNs. We propose to map the dense gas in the Circinus galaxy in order to assess the reliability of molecular AGN tracers with spatially-resolved observations. The galaxy hosts the nearest Compton-thick Seyfert 2 nucleus and is the perfect target to study the dense interstellar medium of obscured AGNs in great detail.',\n"," 'Molecular Absorption Survey against the G2 Cloud Sgr A* Accretion Event. Recently, a cloud, G2, hs been detected on an orbit that will eventually accrete on Sgr A*. Predictins are that the continuum flux will drastically increase during the event. We apply for ALMA TOO time that is triggered when the source will be brighter than 6Jy. This is bright enough to observe molecules in absorption against Sgr A* down to 10^-3 in opacity. In Cycle 0, we were successful to obtain a molecular absorption survey against the supermassive black hole in Centaurus A. Covering a very similar molecular lines, we will be able to directly probe the environments of our own Milky Way from the nearby gas, through the majority of the disk includign three spiral arms, to the Central Molecular Zone and the 4pc central nuclear disk, into the immediate Sgr A* environment. This event is a unique opportunity to probe the molecular environment of the Milky Way. We will also apply for VLA time to perform the cm counterpart of the ALMA mm line survey.',\n"," 'Particle growth in disks across the substellar limit. Circumstellar disks are central for the formation of planets. Their ability to form planets depends on their mass and ability to grow dust into larger particles. With the ALMA sensivity and an ideal sample of 12 young, low mass objects, we propose to get 3mm maps to measure the dust properties of protoplanetary disks over the stellar/substellar transition. By targeting objects already detected at 885um in our Cy1 ALMA program, each too faint for follow-up with any other facility, we maximize the detection probability and the SED coverage, important for the characterization of disk properties. ALMA is essential to move from a small number of detections (brightest low mass objects) to a comprehensive understanding of brown dwarf disk properties. Currently, only 3 Taurus low mass objects (spty. M4-M8) have measured spectral slopes. With the proposed ALMA observations, we will observe four times this number and enable an investigation of the more typical disks. By targeting the lowest mass members of the well known Taurus region, we will efficiently complete a comprehensive population study across the full mass spectrum by combining the proposed ALMA study with existing measurements.',\n"," 'ACA B7 and B8 Mosaic of a Planck selected cluster lensed dusty protocluster at z = 2.7. Our understanding of the cold interstellar medium and extended emission towards protoclusters at high-z is still limited, particularly how wide-spread star formation can be and determining the molecular gas mass in cluster environments. Therefore we request one of the largest ACA B7 and B8 mosaics around a distant, dusty protocluster to-date. We aim to trace the redshifted thermal dust emission from the core field of a sub-mm all-sky Planck-selected, cluster-lensed-protocluster at z=2.66, with IR luminosity log(LIR)> 14 Lsun. By mapping the entire strong lensing magnification map we will characterize the rise in rest-frame dust emission from all counterparts within a physical area of about 650 sq. kpc. Matched with wide-field imaging of low-J CO from ALMA/B3, it will be possible to estimate robust global molecular gas mass and star formation rate surface density maps to examine the distribution of gas/dust and the typical depletion time for this massive, lensed DSFG protocluster. This will showcase the ALMA ACA capability to mosaic wide-frequency ranges to examine protocluster environments in the early Universe.',\n"," 'How Hierarchical is Cluster Formation? The Case of G11.92-0.61. Most stars form in clusters and associations, yet basic aspects of how this occurs remain unknown. Hierarchical and monolithic cluster formation models make opposite predictions for the spatial extent of the protostellar members of a forming protocluster, while individual hierarchical models differ in their predictions for the relative birth order and spatial distribution of high- and low-mass protostars. We will distinguish between these models by searching for the low-mass protostellar population within the deeply embedded massive protocluster G11.92-0.61. With matched-resolution (675 AU) mosaics at 1.0mm and 1.3mm, we increase the mapped area by 3x and improve the mass sensitivity by 5x compared to our Cycle 2 observations, which revealed 16 new low-mass cores within radius<0.33 pc of the central massive protostars. By imaging the full extent of the gas reservoir (920 Msun) at two wavelengths, we will characterize the protostellar population down to a circumstellar gas mass of 0.03 Msun, measuring their emission mechanisms (via spectral indices) and velocities. To gauge their accretion activity, we target multiple outflow tracers spanning a range in abundance and excitation.',\n"," 'Giant factory caught contaminating the environment: dust and molecules expelled by eta Carinae. Eta Carinae is one of the most massive stellar sources in the Milky Way; it entered the hall of fame of astronomy in the mid 19th century when it underwent a major outburst known as the Great Eruption. This event led to the ejection of at least ten Solar masses of material, now distributed in a bipolar nebula called the Homunculus. The material in the Homunculus is nitrogen-rich and carbon- and oxygen-poor, as expected for stellar matter after an interrupted CNO cycle: it provides us with a rare example of an ejecta that has not yet mixed with the ambient medium. Dust and molecules have formed out of this material, and recent APEX and Herschel observations have shown that the chemical composition of the molecular component reflects the peculiar elemental abundances of the Homunculus. Here, we propose to constrain the spatial distribution of the dust and molecular components using high resolution ALMA observations. These observations will constitute a fundamental step toward a complete understanding of the origin and the dust and molecular component around eta Carinae, that will have important repercussions for our comprehension of the latest stages of massive stellar evolution.',\n"," 'Wind properties of the very-metal-poor Halo giant star RU Vul. This very short proposal aims to measure, and likely resolve, the CO (2-1) and (3-2) emission from the oxygen-rich Halo giant RU Vul. At 1/20th of solar metallicity, this is by far the most metal-poor star to have these observations done. The line width will tell us what the driving mechanism of the stellar wind is. The line strengths will inform us of the mass-loss rate, likely further constrained by the measurement of the CO envelope diameter. We also hope to probe inhomogeneities in the outflow. The results of this pilot study will be used to inform future observations, which will help determine the physics of mass loss from metal-poor stars, and calibrate mass-loss rate measurements in existing observations.',\n"," 'Dense Gas and Star Formation in Interacting Galaxy Pair NGC 4567/8 and Comparison to Galactic Dense Cores. In order to determine the state and physical conditions of the dense molecular gas and its relation to the physics of star formation across infrared bright interacting galaxy pair NGC 4567/8 from the VIRUS-P Investigation of the eXtreme ENvironments of Starbursts (VIXENS) survey, we propose to use ALMA to obtain spatially resolved maps of HCN, HCO+, HNC, and CCH gas. We will compare the ALMA dense gas maps at matched spatial resolution to our resolved VIRUS-P integral field unit maps, and a full suite of multi-wavelength ancillary data (CO/HI maps, GALEX, Spitzer, Herschel, and HST). We will also compare the dense gas distribution in this interacting pair to a sample of Galactic high mass star forming dense cores in the same gas tracers. Understanding the physics of star formation and its relation to the dense gas content in a low-z merger and comparing to Galactic star forming regions is paramount to understand ALMA observations of high-z galaxies merging systems. Obtaining spatially resolved maps of multiple tracers of dense gas in nearby galaxy mergers is only now possible thanks to the combination of spatial resolution, sensitivity and UV coverage offered by ALMA in cycle 2.',\n"," 'WISDOM: From Small-Scale Structure to Galaxy-Scale Processes. Observations of molecular gas at both GMC and galactic scales in external galaxies are key to understanding the molecular cloud (MC) formation and the relation of small-scale structures to galaxy-scale processes. Although the exquisite resolution of ALMA allows us to effortlessly resolve individual GMCs in nearby galaxies, we have demonstrated a need for low-resolution ALMA maps in GMC studies to allow complete flux recovery and total mass measurement of cold gas. We aim to 1) accurately measure MC (including low-mass MCs) properties and study their relations to galactic environment, using a high-sensitivity map combining high- and low-resolution observations; 2) investigate Larsons relations in external galaxies; 3) study star formation relations from large galactic-scales to small GMC-scales; and 4) determine the conversion factor between CO flux and H2 mass using the virial mass method. Our work will use a uniform methodology to perform a comprehensive analysis of MCs properties across different galaxy environments. Our aim is to address multiple key open issues regarding MC formation/evolution and their relationship to the wider galactic environments.',\n"," 'Isotopic ratios in Neptunes atmosphere and the origin of CO and HCN (Resubmission of cycle 1 program). This proposal is a resubmission of the proposal 2012.1.00624.S accepted in cycle 1 with \"highest priority of being observed\", but this project has not been observed. In order to avoid duplication, if this project is finally observed in cycle 2, we do not need observations during cycle 3. Isotopic measurements represent a powerful tool to diagnose the origin and evolution of planetary atmospheres. The 14N/15N ratio, in particular, shows a large range of variability throughout the Solar System. The main goals of this proposal are i) to determine the 12C/13C, 16O/18O and 14N/15N isotopic ratios in Neptune CO and HCN, in order to constrain the origin of these species in Neptunes atmosphere and to characterize isotope-related fractionation effects within the atmosphere ii) to take benefit of the large bandwidth of ALMA to simultaneously search for two additional species, CS and CH3CCH. The detection of CS would bring support to the cometary origin hypothesis for CO and/or HCN, and the measurement of CH3CCH would provide new constraints on Neptunes hydrocarbon photochemistry. This will provide novel clues to understand the origin of these molecules.',\n"," 'Who Stirs the Pot? Resolving the Vertical Thickness of Debris Disks. The dusty debris disks around main sequence stars are hallmarks of substantial reservoirs of large planetesimals. Edge-on debris disks present a unique opportunity to characterize the dynamics of the collisional cascade, since the vertical scale height encodes the velocity dispersion and allows us to measure the total mass of any perturbing bodies \"stirring\" the planetesimal belt. Millimeter wavelengths are uniquely suited for revealing the dynamical state of debris disks, since the large grains are not subject to the excitatory effects of stellar radiation that puff up the vertical scale height at optical and infrared wavelengths. Here we propose to complement our recent high-resolution Band 6 observations that spatially resolved the scale height of the AU Mic disk for the first time by making the same measurement at Band 9. Resolving the vertical structure at two widely separated frequencies will allow us to constrain both the grain size distribution and the velocity dispersion as a function of particle size. For the first time, we will be able to distinguish the strengths of the bodies in the collisional cascade.',\n"," 'Directly measuring black hole mass of a quenched galaxy at z=2.1. The recent discovery of massive, quenched galaxies in the early universe has changed our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. The primary physical mechanism that is responsible for star formation quenching in such massive systems is yet to be identified. One of the most plausible mechanisms is by strong feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The causality is still unclear due to the lack of direct evidence of SMBHs in the quenched system. To provide the smoking-gun evidence, here we propose Band 6 observations targeting a quenched galaxy at z=2.1. An unprecedented spatial resolution of ~75pc will be achieved by combining its strong lens-magnification and the resolving power of ALMA. Our observations aim to resolve the sphere-of-influence of the target, allowing us to directly measure black hole mass via the [CI] line. This will be the first measurement of black hole mass in a quenched galaxy beyond the local universe.',\n"," 'Galactic Census of All Massive Starless Cores within 5 kpc. Star formation research has still not revealed the initial conditions for high--mass star formation (HMSF). This is largely due to the lack of clear--cut examples of dense clumps that are bound to form stars but have not done so yet (high--mass starless clumps: HMSCs). While scattered, small sky patch searches have been made, no systematic galaxy wide survey that can place such searches on a statistical firm footing has ever been conducted. We have now performed a systematic search for HMSCs from the ATLASGAL 870mu survey that covers the entire inner Galactic plane which are dense and devoid of infrared sources up to 70mum. Embedded star formation will manifest via outflowing, shocked, and warm gas component with little or no evidence of cold gas towards dense cores. By weeding out such masqueraders, and revealing the extent of fragmentation in all HMSCs, a feat only achievable with a survey machine like ALMA in an ambitious but highly economical <10 hrs main array time, we will for the first time reveal the truly massive starless cores. We will obtain the most robust constraints to date on whether massive starless cores exists, their lifetime and the initial conditions for HMSF.',\n"," 'Pinpointing dust-enshrouded star-forming regions within young proto-cluster galaxies at z=2.16. Our recent narrow-band H-alpha study of a rich proto-cluster at z=2.16 (PKS1138-262) with Subaru Telescope revealed that star-forming (SF) galaxies in the proto-cluster environment are significantly more massive and more actively forming stars than general field galaxies. Those massive SF galaxies in young forming clusters are believed to be the progenitors of massive cluster spheroids in the local universe. We here propose ALMA Band-7 (870um) observations of 24um-detected, massive H-alpha emitters in this proto-cluster environment to spatially resolve their dust continuum emission on ~kpc scale (comparable to the HST rest-UV data available in this field). Our goals are (1) to identify dusty SF clumps inside the galaxies and pinpoint the location of most intense starbursts (hence rapid stellar/bulge build-up) within young cluster galaxies; and (2) to unveil the nature and environmental dependence of individual SF clumps by comparing our sample with those of general field galaxies at the same redshift obtained through our successful ALMA programs in the previous cycles. This program was approved twice (Cycle-3+4), but the observation was not carried out successfully.',\n"," 'Chemistry in the Brightest Luminous-Infrared Merger. We propose to fill a large gap in extragalactic spectral surveys by observing NGC 3256, the most luminous galaxy within z=0.01. This galaxy is the brightest on the sky among the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) powered by merger-induced galaxy-wide starburst. This class, whose energy source is known to be starburst (not an AGN), is the majority of the luminous LIRGs (11.5 ~ < log L(IR) < 12). Also, they are ~10 times more luminous than NGC 253 and M82. Yet disproportionally little attention has been paid for its astrochemical properties. We will observe key molecular tracers in multiple transitions in Bands 3 and 6, and compare the derived chemical abundances to those in Arp 220, a ULIRG having very compact energy source(s), NGC 253, a local starburst, and the Seyfert nucleus of NGC 1068, as well as other sources with spectral scans. Principal component analysis will reveal the effects of merger and high-luminosity in the chemical composition.',\n"," 'A study of molecular clouds interacting with cosmic rays in the supernova remnant IC 443. Supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs), and yet its acceleration mechanism is not fully understood. In particular, the CR acceleration efficiency is still a matter of debate. IC 443 is one of the very few SNRs where the gamma-ray emission produced via collisions between CR and interstellar protons is identified, being an excellent laboratory to study CR acceleration in SNRs. Recently we find some evidence for presence of the 0.1-pc scale clumpy molecular clouds in IC 443 with the near-infrared [FeII] and H2 observations. The clumpy clouds may allow CR protons to interact with large amounts of the interstellar protons in IC 443. However spatial resolutions of the current available CO maps of IC 443 are not high enough to resolve such clumpy clouds, preventing us from precisely estimating the interstellar proton density, an important parameter to evaluate the CR energy and thus the CR acceleration efficiency in SNRs. In order to evaluate the CR acceleration efficiency in IC443, with ALMA, we aim to investigate morphologies of the clouds in IC 443 at the 0.05-pc scale for the first time.',\n"," 'AGN Feedback and its Role in Galaxy Evolution: gas and stellar kinematics of radio-loud early-type galaxies. Galaxy formation theories struggle to explain the quenching of star formation and the formation of sub-structures in early-type galaxies (ETG). The solutions to both problems may well be connected: molecular gas can feed active galactic nuclei and generate feedback, while also leading to new decoupled stellar components. We have already obtained VLT/VIMOS integral-field unit spectroscopy and 12CO(2-1) line observations with APEX for a complete volume-limited (z<0.03) sample of 10 southern radio galaxies. Here, we request follow-up CO(2-1) imaging of the 9 objects rich in molecular gas. Our targets differ from ETGs studied previously at similar spatial resolution (100-300 pc), being significantly more massive and harbouring active jets. We will thus be able to isolate the role played by jets (likely the dominant feedback mode in local ETGs) in the overall formation and evolution of ETGs. ALMA is essential and ideal for the proposed mapping and, using Atlas3D as a radio-quiet control sample, our sample is appropriately sized for a first study aiming to identify and contrast trends.',\n"," 'Gas-Mass Evolution in Milky Way Progenitors at z~1.3. Although there is a growing number of detections of cool gas in distant galaxies, these have been limited to rarer high mass, high SFR objects. We have almost no knowledge of the cool gas in more moderate-mass, \"typical\" galaxies, including the progenitors of our own Milky Way. Here we propose to obtain the first measurements of cold gas in four \"typical\" galaxies at 1.2 < z < 1.4 using ALMA Band 4 observations of the CO(3-2) emission line. We have carefully selected the target galaxies from our deep near-IR ZFOURGE/CANDELS survey such that they have the mass (Log M*/Msol = 10.2) and SFR (=20 Msol/yr) of Milky Way-sized galaxy progenitors. The target redshift range corresponds to when Milky Way-type galaxies transition from forming stars at their near-peak rate to when their star formation quenches, and it is also when these galaxies began to form bulges. With these data we will (1) measure the gas masses and (2) measure the star-formation efficiency. We will correlate these measures against other galaxy properties (including bulge fraction) to understand what mechanisms lead to the decline of star-formation in Milky Way-sized galaxies.',\n"," 'Moving Past Small Number Statistics in Astrochemistry: A Molecular Survey of 25 Hot Cores. Studies of chemical evolution have traditionally focused on a small number of exceptionally molecularly rich and bright sources due to the historical difficulty in detecting complex interstellar molecules. This small sample size biases our understanding of standard chemical evolution, and prevents calibration of chemical models to standard conditions. Single-dish surveys that have attempted to address this issue by surveying substantially larger sample sizes have suffered from extreme beam dilution, due to the very small angular size of typical chemically rich hot cores. Here, we propose to exploit both the sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA to conduct a distance-limited survey of twenty five hot core sources. We target several spectral windows designed to provide the maximal scientific return, and will use the results to calibrate several of the industry-standard models and identify critical areas in which these models need refinement.',\n"," 'How extreme are the extreme star-forming hosts of optically-bright quasars at 2 < z < 4?. We propose band 7 continuum ACA stand-alone observations of the most infrared-luminous type 1 quasar hosts in the Herschel HerS and HeLMS fields. The proposed observations will establish whether the Herschel-SPIRE fluxes come from a single component alone, placing the hosts of these type 1 quasars among the most extreme star formers in the Universe with SED-derived star formation rates (SFRs) above 1000 solar masses per year, that will immediately chanllenge the models for galaxy assembly. If not, we will resolve the SPIRE fluxes into multiple components, allowing for revised SFRs. Such multiplicity could either be the result of unrelated sources lying closely to one another in projection but far apart in redshift, or real oversensities, in which case we will have immediately identified a sample of high-redshift overdense region candidates around type 1 quasars, hosting multiple starbursts, that will be ideal targets for follow up observations.',\n"," 'Physics of low-metallicity molecular clouds with ALMA. Star formation (SF) in dwarf galaxies occurs at the brink of the dynamical balance between gravity, turbulence, pressure and cooling. To probe SF physics in this metal-poor low-pressure regime, we propose a CO(2-1) pilot study at 3pc resolution of 4 nearby dwarf galaxies within 5 Mpc and having CO(3-2) detections with APEX. Only with this resolution is it possible to retrieve the tiny CO-emitting clouds preponderant at low metallicity. All targets are far-infrared (dust) emitters, and have a vast range of ancillary data to trace atomic gas, dust extinction, and young stellar populations. The ~2,100 clouds we expect to detect across the sample give statistical leverage to address: (1) the cloud dynamical state and lifecycles; (2) the effects of stellar feedback; and (3) with ACA+TP, the dependence of the conversion of CO luminosity to H2 mass, alphaCO, on CO surface brightness and spatial scale. Our proposed observations will be the first systematic study of the regulating mechanisms at low metallicity and will test emerging theories of SF as a dynamical balancing act.',\n"," 'CN excitation in T-Tauri disks: a challenge to protoplanetary disks models. Gas and dust disks are ubiquitous around Pre-Main-Sequence stars of masses below 3 solar masses. Understanding their density and temperature structures is one of the major issues to study the formation of planetary systems. Theoretical studies of proto-planetary disks structure lead to a model with three layers, i.e. a photo-dissociation region illuminated by the stellar UV, a warm molecular layer and a cold gas-phase molecule depleted mid-plane. This picture is however not yet constrained by current observations. Nevertheless, existing observations of CO, CN , HCN and CCH suggest very low excitation temperature (< 10 K), and challenge the current disk model. Here we propose to take advantage of the ALMA Early Science to observe the CN J=3-2 and HCN J=4-3 lines (one setup in Band 7) in one ``cold disk surrounding the TTauri star DM Tau and in the ``warm disk surrounding the Herbig Ae star MWC 480. Combining these observations with our CN J=2-1 and HCN J=1-0 data taken with the PdBI will allow us to better constraint the excitation condition, and check if the apparent low excitation temperatures is due to sub-thermal excitation.',\n"," 'An efficient CO survey of sub-millimetre galaxies from AS2UDS. We propose an efficient band 3 search for CO emission from 59 sub-millimetre galaxies selected from our ALMA continuum survey of the 716 SCUBA-2 sources in the ~1 degree^2 UDS field. Our targets comprise 29 ALMA-located sub-millimetre galaxies brighter than S_870>7.5mJy (none of which have spectroscopic redshifts), along with a comparison sample of 30 fainter (S_870~3.5mJy) sub-millimetre galaxies which have precise spectroscopic redshifts putting CO into the tunings for the flux-limited sample. Together these 59 galaxies represent a population which makes a major contribution to the extragalactic far-infrared/sub-millimetre backgrounds and hence the obscured star-formation rate density in the Universe. Our sample provides an unique laboratory to investigate the evolution of the cold gas mass function of galaxies and to relate the gas content, gas depletion timescales and properties of galaxies to the evolution of the star-formation rate density at z~1-5 and the formation and evolution of some of the most extreme star-forming galaxies which have ever existed.',\n"," 'Mapping Ionizing Photon Rates in the Era of ALMA. We propose for Band-3 (95 GHz) imaging to create ionizing photon rate maps. These observations will showcase ALMAs ability to precisely quantify star formation activity among a physically diverse sample of 9 extragalactic star-forming complexes within galaxies spanning a large range in physical properties (e.g., SFR, metallicity, ISRF, H_2/HI ratios). Each region has a wealth of ancillary data as they have been targeted by the SINGS/KINGFISH mid/far-infrared spectroscopic mapping programs, as well as with the Jansky VLA in the Ka-band (33GHz). By targeting emission at 95 GHz, these observations sample a sweet spot in galaxy radio-to-infrared spectra where contributions from synchrotron, anomalous microwave, and thermal dust emission are minimized with respect to free-free emission arising from newly formed massive stars. Consequently, these new ALMA data will yield an extinction-free measure of the ionzing flux and serve as the zero-point to calibrate other SFR diagnostics available from the rich existing and forthcoming data from the SINGS/KINGFISH legacy programs including, but not limited to, warm/cool dust, PAHs, UV/H-alpha+IR hybrids, [CII]158um (and other mid- and far-infrared fine structure lines). At 2\" resolution, and given the range of distances to our sample galaxies, we will map the distributions of ionizing photon rates on spatial scales spanning 90-160pc for comparison with our ancillary dust, H-alpha, Pa-alpha, PAH, atomic and molecular (CO) line maps, providing a better quantitative understanding of the connections between anomalous dust, free-free emission, and gas conditions across the full range of abundances, radiation fields, and ISM physical conditions present in normal galaxies today. The observational setup will also allow for the serendipitous detection of a number of dense molecular gas tracers available within Band-3 (e.g., HCN, HCO+, HNC), potentially enabling studies of the resolved star formation law and astrochemistry. This program is an ideal use of ALMA Cyle1 time as the continuum sensitivity of ALMA in 2012-13 is already powerful enough to make a major scientific advance in the study of extragalactic star formation.',\n"," 'A survey for CO[5-4]emission in star forming galaxies at 1.1<z<1.7. We propose to detect CO[5-4] (and the 520um rest-frame continuum as a bonus) for 127 galaxies at 1.112 measured by Herschel, including similar numbers of main sequence and starburst galaxies. Thanks to our direct detection with IRAM PdBI of CO[5-4] in a small sample of comparable objects, and evidence of a linear LIR to LCO[5-4] relation, we can reliably estimate required integration times that are of order of 1 minute per galaxy, enough also for continuum detections. For all these targets we will have a measurement of high-J CO[5-4] luminosity, LIR, Mdust and Mgas (from continuum) and of U=LIR/Mdust, the hardness of the radiation field. We will be able to perform an unprecedented investigation into the nature of star formation inside high-redshift galaxies, statistically confirm the supposed linear relation between LIR and LCO[5-4] and measure its scatter and systematics for different galaxy types, and explore the correlation between CO excitation and star formation efficiency. With 6.2h of ALMA observing time in Band6 we will obtain the first statistical sample of CO detections in the z~1.4 Universe.',\n"," 'Probing Episodic Accretion in Very Low Luminosity Objects. We propose to observe N2H+ (1-0) and C18O (1-0) toward eight Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs). Our goal is to probe episodic accretion which is used to answer the long-standing Luminosity problem (Kenyon et al. 1990). Episodic accretion models consider that a protostar is at a quiescent accretion status for most of time and accretion bursts occasionally occur to deliver material onto the central star. The accretion luminosity of a protostar undergoing episodic accretion process will vary through an accretion burst. It is difficult to detect a significant variation of luminosity since the timescale for an accretion burst is very short. However, the luminosity variation can be found in the chemical vestige. The N2H+ depleted hole toward a source center can be caused by an increase of luminosity and it can preserves for a long time after the accretion luminosity decay. Therefore, studying N2H+ depletion provides us an opportunity to identify a protostar which has experienced an accretion burst, and explore evidences of episodic accretion process.',\n"," 'The extremely peculiar globular cluster system of UDG GAMA-526784 and its implications. Observations of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs, with luminosities of dwarfs but sizes of giant galaxies) have picked up a lot of attention by the community. Two nagging problems are 1) the apparent lack of dark matter of some UDGs and 2) their anomalously abundant-and-bright globular clusters. The former is difficult to reconcile with a LCDM model of structure formation, while the latter is contrary to observations in any other galaxy. A newly discovered UDG may provide valuable insight towards solving both problems. This unique object has similar properties to typical UDGs, apart from a widely spread population of compact star-forming regions. Some properties of this galaxy are similar to those hypothesised by Silk 2019, who predicts the formation of massive globular clusters (GCs) and links it to the formation of UDGs that lack dark matter. We aim to measure the molecular gas content of the regions, constraining the depletion timescales and the expected final mass of the star clusters. With ACA we will constrain the molecular gas content and, possibly, dynamical state of the whole galaxy, assessing if it lacks dark matter. These are essential ingredients to test the Silk 2019 model',\n"," 'Reformation of Cold Molecular Disks in Merger Remnants. It has been long predicted from numerical simulations that a major merger of two disk galaxies results in a formation of the spheroid-dominated early-type galaxy. Contrary to this classical scenario of galaxy merger evolution, recent high-resolution simulations that include more realistic gas physics have shown that not all of the major mergers will become an early-type galaxy, but some will reemerge as a disk dominated late-type galaxy. Here we propose to obtain sensitive and high resolution CO(1-0) maps toward 20 optically selected advanced merger remnants with well studied stellar hosts. The main purpose of this study is to identify the presence of molecular gas disks formed through a merger of two galaxies, and to examine the dependence on the stellar mass and structure in a statistically significant sample of merger remnants. We already have a tentative evidence that disk formation is common in merger remnants from our own analysis of archival interferometric data. If CO(1-0) is detected in all of the proposed sources, the new ALMA observations will triple the number of CO maps for a robust statistical analysis.',\n"," 'Shut It Down: Probing Molecular Feedback in z=4-5 Dusty, Star-forming Galaxies. One of the most important realizations of the last fiteen years is the vital role that feedback must play in the evolution of galaxies, particularly at the massive end (Mstar > 10^11Msun). Star formation appears to have been efficiently \"quenched,\" but the processes by which quenching occurs are poorly understood. Theoretical models invoke feedback from AGN and/or star formation to disrupt, expel, or heat the gas and prevent further star formation. Recent observations and circumstantial evidence suggests that the bulk of star formation in the earliest quiescent galaxies took place in dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z>4. We propose to test models of feedback and the evolutionary connection between DSFGs and quiescent galaxies by spatially and spectrally resolving massive molecular outflows in 7 z=4.2-5.3 galaxies. Our observations will constrain the outflow geometry and mass loss rates, allowing us to determine whether quenching is due to gas depletion or gas removal. Our targets span a factor of 12 in star formation rate (SFR) and 30 in SFR surface density, giving a large dynamic range to constrain outflow scaling relations and match local work at high-z.',\n"," 'Has Planet Formation Already Begun in the Class I Protostellar Phase?. Recent ALMA observations of the early Class II protostar HL Tau revealed gap structures indicative of newly-forming planets. The observations represent the earliest direct detection of planet formation, suggesting that planets form during the first million years of star formation. These observations showed that planets form before some theoretical predictions, which begs the simple question: \"When exactly do planets start to form?\" While it is known that planets should start their formation in a Keplerian disk, we do not know if they start forming at times significantly younger than HL Tau. To further constrain whether gap structure appears at an early stage, i.e., the Class I stage, we propose for high angular resolution (0.035\" = 4.4 AU) toward the Keplerian disk IRS 63 located in Ophiuchus. This source is one of the brightest known Class I disks and has a small inclination of only 30 degrees. These observations will easily detect gap structure if it exists in younger sources. Such observations will either reveal the earliest known direct evidence of planet formation or put significant constraints on the age of which planets start to clear out material in protostellar disks.',\n"," 'Fire and Wind in Compton-thick Monster: The Case of NGC 4418. [This project will take ~125 min of 12m-array time on the galaxy. See Tech. Justification.] We propose to study a putative Compton-thick AGN and its molecular outflow in the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 4418 to reveal the true nature and evolutionary path of this elusive galaxy nucleus. For the fiery hot but dust-enshrouded nucleus we will use the new 1 km baseline to measure the size and surface temperature of its continuum core, i.e., dust photosphere. We will then obtain the bolometric luminosity from within the central few 10 pc using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. We will also measure the dynamical mass of the core using molecular lines including bright CO(3–2). The luminosity-to-mass ratio and luminosity density measured this way will constrain the nature of the hidden nucleus because, for example, stars cannot have as high an L/M ratio as an accreting black hole. Our SMA data suggest that the nucleus of NGC 4418 is an ideal target for this new approach and for Cycle 1 ALMA. We will also map in CO(2–1) a multi-kpc superwind that we found emanating from the nucleus. We will measure the distribution and velocity field of molecular gas in the outflow to determine the mass outflow rate and kinematical age. NGC 4418 is among the nearest galaxies that have both a highly Compton-thick nucleus and a giant outflow. Thus the proposed observations will become an archetype of ALMA studies on galaxies in rapid transition from the buried infrared-luminous phase to optically visible Seyfert/quasars. The AGN/starburst feedback widely regarded important in galaxy evolution is in full action here for detailed analysis.',\n"," 'GG TAU AB: Studying viscous and tidal effects in the circumbinary disk. We propose to observe the hierarchical system of GG Tau AB simultaneously in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO 3-2, and 0.8mm continuum emission in Band 7 (B7), using an extended configuration (0.22\") of ALMA. The unprecedented resolution in B7 will allow us to accurately probe the impact of viscous spreading and tidal disturbances on the shaping of both circumbinary and circumstellar gas and dust. Thanks to its distance ($\\\\sim 140$~pc) and brightness (800 mJy at 1.3mm), the GG Tau AB system, two young (TTauri) binaries separated by 11 (with stellar separations of 0.25 and 0.4 for A and B binaries), provides a unique opportunity to study the physics and dynamics of the mass distribution in a young multiple system. In particular, these new images will allow us 1) to precisely measure the morphology of the circumbinary ring (ring width, internal and external slopes of surface density), 2) to search for any azimuthal asymmetry or inhomogeneity in the ring, 3) to map the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO 3-2 lines within the gap searching for departure of Keplerian velocity and 4) to measure the individual continuum flux densities of the inner circumstellar disks.',\n"," 'MAGNUM FEAR: Magnum Follow-up Exploiting ALMA Resolution.. AGN-driven outflows are believed to be signatures of feedback in action on the host galaxies of accreting BHs. Outflows are observed both in molecular and ionised gas but their acceleration mechanisms are still debated. There are indications that they represent two phases of the same outflowing medium, with molecular gas accounting for most of the mass, but their physical relation is almost completely unknown. We have recently started the MAGNUM project, a survey of nearby Seyferts aimed at a detailed study of the effects of AGN activity on their hosts. The high intrinsic spatial resolution (10-100 pc) combined with the VLT/MUSE field of view and spectral coverage allows to study outflow properties with unprecedented detail. We propose ALMA follow up observations in CO(2-1) to detect molecular outflows and to compare their physical properties with those of the ionized outflows, at the high intrinsic spatial resolution allowed by the closeness of the targets. This is the first study of this kind that will critically constrain the origin of outflows and the impact on host galaxies in low luminosity AGN and that will serve as a laboratory for higher luminosity but more distant AGN.',\n"," 'Measurements of high-density gas tracers in lensed submillimter galaxies. Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) constitute a population of high-redshift and heavily dust-obscured galaxies undergoing a phase of intense star formation, accounting for a large part of the total energy emitted in the Universe at far-infrared wavelengths. This population spans the peak epoch of star formation in the Universe, and is believed to be evolutionary linked to quasars and present-day ellipticals. Most star formation takes place in dense cloud cores, traced by molecular species such as HCN, HNC, and HCO+, which have some of the brightest lines after CO. Estimating the dense gas properties in SMGs using these lines is therefore essential in understanding galaxy evolution and the history of obscured star formation in the Universe. To date, the detection of such lines at high redshift has been limited mostly to the brightest quasars. We propose deep ALMA observations of the (3-2) transitions of HCN, HNC, and HCO+ in the lensed SMGs H-ATLAS J090740.0-004200 and J091043.1-000321, at z=1.5746 and z=1.784, respectively. At these redshifts, the targeted lines will fall in ALMA Band 3, and can be obtained in a single tuning in a relative short integration. Because of their large luminosities enhanced by gravitational lensing, favorable redshifts, and availability of ancillary data, these targets are well suited for the ALMA Cycle 1 capabilities. Targeting two SMGs will enable the comparison of the dense gas content between two galaxies characterized by different CO excitation, and will provide a faster progress in this area than has been previously possible. The three chosen lines will provide us with the necessary diagnostics to constrain the total amount of dense gas and its physical properties, estimate the age of the starburst, and look for indications of AGN activity. We aim to obtain the first multi-line diagnostic set for dense gas in high redshift SMGs, showcasing the potential of ALMA to break new ground in the study of obscured star formation at high redshift.',\n"," 'Fifty AU STudy of the chemistry in the disk/envelope system of Solar-like protostars (FAUST). The huge variety of planetary systems discovered in recent decades likely depends on the early history of their formation. The proposed FAUST Large Program focuses specifically on the early history of Solar-like protostars and their chemical diversity at scales of ~50 au, where planets are expected to form. In particular, the goal of the project is to reveal and quantify the variety of chemical composition of the envelope/disk system at scales of 50 au in a sample of Class 0 and I protostars representative of the chemical diversity observed at larger scales. For each source, we propose 50 au spatial resolution observations of a set of molecules able to: (1) disentangle the components of the 50-2000 au envelope/disk system; (2) characterise the organic complexity in each of them; (3) probe their ionization structure; (4) measure their molecular deuteration. The output will be a homogeneous database of thousands of images from different lines and species, i.e., an unprecedented source-survey of the chemical diversity of Solar-like protostars at 50 au scales. FAUST will provide the community with a legacy dataset that will be a milestone for astrochemistry and star formation studies.',\n"," 'Recovering Extended Structures in Merger Remnants. Contrary to the classical scenario of galaxy merger in which an elliptical galaxy forms due to a major merger, recent studies argued that some fraction of the merger would reemerge as a disk galaxy by forming an extended gaseous disk. In order to check this scenario, we conducted a CO (1-0) survey on local merger remnants with the Cycle 0 ALMA 12m-array and found a high occurrence rate of molecular gas disks with various sizes. However, the ALMA data were taken using the 12m-array alone and they were clearly suffering from the missing flux problem, up to 57% in the worst case. Correctly quantifying the true size of the molecular disk and assessing its relation to the stellar size is the key to unambiguously define the type of galaxy the merger will evolve into. We thus propose follow-up CO (1-0) observations with ACA towards 14 merger remnants to accurately measure the extent and amount of molecular gas, by combining new ACA data with the Cycle 0 12m-array data. This study will allow us to accurately evaluate the frequency of the occurrence of extended gas disks in post-mergers, and offer stronger support to the scenario that merging events are the crossroads of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Formaldehyde deuteration in the protoplanetary disk of DG Tau: the organics trail from protostars to the solar system. The origin of organics in the solar system (SS) is a key unanswered issue. Is the composition of the SS inherited from the prestellar phase? Or does it reflect chemical processing in the protosolar nebula? Deuteration is a powerful tool to answer these questions as it strongly depends on the molecules formation environment. High deuteration of organics (e.g. formaldehyde H2CO) in protostars (~0.04-1) is thought to be the signature of cold ice chemistry in the pre-collapse phase, whereas deuteration in the SS is lower (<0.01). There is a missing piece of information: what is the organics deuteration in protoplanetary disks (PPDs), where planets, comets, and meteorites form? Organics are mostly frozen on ices in PPDs, therefore their gas-phase abundance is low, making the detection of their less abundant deuterated forms a real challenge. To fill in the gap we propose ALMA-Band 5 deep observations of HDCO towards the nearby DG Tau disk to complement H2CO observations probing the outer disk ices. This will allow us to obtain the FIRST estimate of H2CO deuteration in a PPD and to compare it with that in protostars and in SS, thus testing the inheritance versus disk reset scenarios.',\n"," 'The earliest stages of molecular outflow activity from the young protostar Lupus 3 MMS. We propose Band 3 and Band 6 observations of CO isotopologues and continuum for the class 0 source Lupus 3 MMS. Consistent observations in two bands, performed with the same angular- and spectral-resolution, allow a comprehensive study of the morphology, kinematics, and temperature structure of the outflow and its driving protostellar source. We will map the entire outflow using the 12m array and the ACA, studying the collimated and cavity structures of the outflow. This is a particularly interesting source because accretion has only very recently begun, and we will use its outflow as a proxy for the accretion history, therefore providing a case study for the very earliest stages of the low-mass star formation process.',\n"," 'Resolved gas and dust in star-forming galaxies within the epoch of re-ionisation. Characterising the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies in the early Universe is one of the prime goals of observational astrophysics. Currently, ideal targets for such studies are luminous, spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at z~6-7. We have recently detected the most luminous [CII] line in such a z>6 source (CR7, Matthee+in prep). This high luminosity however is at odds with observations from other galaxies, indicating a large dispersion. For example, CR7 is at least 10 times more luminous in [CII] than Himiko, while their UV properties are similar. Moreover, three separate clumps in CR7 are resolved in [CII] emission, indicating metallicity variations of about a factor 2, confirming that clumps are in different evolutionary stages. We now propose to target two newly discovered, spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies at z=6.55 (MASOSA and VR7). VR7 is even more UV-luminous than CR7, while MASOSA is UV-faint and potentially dusty. We propose to constrain their dust masses, their L[CII]/SFR ratio and gas-metallicity (from [CII] measurements), allowing us to constrain the enrichment of the ISM by the earliest generations of stars.',\n"," 'Cloud-scale neutral atomic carbon in the local star-forming galaxy NGC 4321. We propose to obtain 120 pc resolution CI 3P1-3P0 map of the full molecular gas disk of the nearby star-forming galaxy NGC 4321. We will use the existing multi-wavelength datasets at similar spatial resolution, including H-alpha, FUV, dust extinction, 13CO(1-0), and CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio maps, as well as GMC and HII region catalogues and galactic sub-region mask (center/bar/arm/inter-arm). These rich ancillary datasets are crucial to determine which map has a more similar distribution to CI, i.e., answering the two-decade-long standing question, \"Where does CI come from in galaxies?\" We will also apply a stacking analysis using ancillary datasets, and then (1) discuss the impact of the presence of CO-dark molecular gas as functions of GMC properties and environments, and (2) provide \"typical\" CI properties of molecular clouds in a single star-forming galaxy. The requested CI observations will cover the important parameter space between parsec-scale galactic GMC studies and sub-kpc-scale extragalactic studies, and therefore they will provide a benchmark measurement for all future studies utilizing the neutral atomic carbon line.',\n"," 'ACA Observatory Project: SMC Band 6 CO and continuum mapping. The SMC is an ideal laboratory to study star formation and evolution in a low metallicity environment similar to the early Universe. As a legacy observatory project we propose a large area ACA-only map of 12CO, continuum and H(30)alpha of the North SMC bar, which contains active areas of star formation including the brightest HII region in the SMC, NGC 346 / N 66. This will improve several-fold in resolution compared to any previous single dish millimeter wavelength surveys of the region, providing a valuable resource to the community for future ALMA follow-up of a broad range of science areas.',\n"," 'Winds of change? - probing the nuclear activity and outflow of the FIR-excess galaxy NGC1377 v1.5. ALMA offers a unique opportunity to probe the nature of FIR-excess galaxies where the IR emission is powered by dust-embedded starbursts and/or AGN activity. The molecular outflow and dusty core of the extreme FIR-excess, synchrotron deficient galaxy NGC1377 presents an opportunity to study this important phenomenon. We propose extended array CO 1-0 observations to image the molecular outflow to determine its age and address the nature of the dust enshrouded nuclear activity: an extremely young (1~Myr) starburst or a super-Eddington accreting black hole. We furthermore propose CO 6-5 and 690 micron continuum observations also in extended to study the buried central source on scales of 20 pc. We expect intense, 50-80 K emission from the very nuclear region probing the dynamics of the inner disk, the enclosed mass and the gas heating/energy budget. The continuum will constrain the IR surface luminosity and dust mass. This proposed study will allow us to uniquely probe the very earliest phases of nuclear activity - the onset of black hole accretion or the pre-synchrotron beginnings of a starburst.',\n"," 'Enhanced Molecular Oxygen abundance in galaxies with AGN molecular outflow. We propose to observe red-shifted 118.75 GHz O2 emission as well as CO 2-1 toward one nearby AGN IRAS 10565+2448, in which molecular outflow had been detected with CO 1-0 observation. It will be the first well-imaged extra-galactic O2 emission, which will be an ideal tool for studying AGN feedback and understanding cooling and oxygen chemistry in molecular outflow. If O2 118.75 GHz line in IRAS 10565+2448 can be imaged within several hours, it will open a new window for searching molecular outflow in AGN, because outflows identified with CO observations can severely be contaminated by non-Gaussian components of the host galaxy. On the other hand, O2 emission from dense molecular gas in host galaxy can be neglected. If the enhancement of molecular oxygen in galaxies with AGN molecular outflow is a common phenomenon, such observations will be important to provide inforamtions of gas properties in O2 emiting regions for new chemical models of O2 formation.',\n"," 'Sunyaev-Zeldovich mapping of an extreme cool core in the galaxy cluster RXJ1504-02. The massive, relaxed galaxy cluster RXJ1504 hosts one of the most extreme X-ray luminous cool cores. Cool cores are a balancing act of several physical phenomena -- the radiative cooling is offset by some heating mechanism(s) with a feedback loop to keep the cluster stable. Cooling depends on the gas spatial structure, while heat can have several sources, whose efficiency depends on poorly understood physical properties of the intracluster plasma. We recently obtained a Sunyaev-Zeldovich map of the RXJ1504 core with CARMA at 12\" and 44\" resolutions to study the distribution of its gas pressure. While there is large-scale agreement, we found that the peak of the SZ signal does not coincide with the X-ray peak, but instead sits at the tip of a subtle sloshing gas filament. It is very difficult to generate small-scale pressure nonuniformities in a non-merging cluster; something significant must be missing from our understanding of the cool core physics. Several interesting possibilities exist. We propose to resolve the structure of our 20\" SZ peak with ALMAs 4.5\" beam in order to elucidate its possible nature. This would be the first high-resolution SZ study of a cluster cool core.',\n"," 'Filling in the missing piece of the water trail: D2O observations in a protoplanetary disk. Water is a crucial ingredient for life as we know it on Earth. Furthermore, water enhances planet formation and it is the main carrier of oxygen, one of the most abundant elements. Still, the trail of water from clouds to planets is unclear. Water on Earth may be inherited from its parent molecular cloud, but it is also possible that water has been destroyed and reformed along the water trail from the cloud to the disk. Recently, observations of the HDO/H2O ratio in a young disk around an outbursting star have shown that water likely is inherited from the parent cloud. However, models have shown that the reprocessing of water in protostellar envelopes and disks can lead to a similar HDO/H2O ratio to that in the case of inheritance. Thus, we propose to use the most sensitive tool to distinguish these scenarios: D2O/HDO to HDO/H2O ratio. We target D2O in the same disk where HDO and H218O already have been detected at high signal to noise, filling the gap in D2O observations in a key stage evolution from clouds to planets. Therefore, we will observe D2O to observationally the complete water trail, especially the crucial step from cloud to disk.',\n"," 'A Dusty Starburst Galaxy Caught in a Heavy Bombardment?. The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is the battlefield between gas inflows along cosmic filaments and outflows from galactic disks. How the CGM connects to star formation is one of the most pressing questions in galaxy evolution. Although intervening cool gas in the CGM leads to strong Ly-a absorption that is evident in the spectra of background QSOs, there are only a handful of detections of the galaxies that give rise to strong absorbers at z > 2. By providing sensitive spectral mapping, ALMA is revolutionizing this field. In Cycle 3, we identified the first association between a hyperluminous starburst galaxy and multiple strong HI absorbers at z ~ 2.7. The spectra of two background QSOs show consecutive Ly-a absorption spanning over 1700 km/s, indicating the existence of a 6-Mpc gas-rich overdensity. We propose deep band-3 observations to map out its spatial and kinematic structure in CO(3-2). By comparing the data with simulations, we will identify gas-rich subhalos of the starburst and check how long their bombardment could sustain the starburst. The observations will also shed light on the chemical enrichment of the CGM and the diverse gaseous environments in massive halos.',\n"," 'SMC NGC 602: an exemplary test of low-metallicity star formation and GMC evolution.. NGC602 in the SMC wing is an isolated, very young nascent OB association, so well characterized that it can serve as a prototype to understand dense gas and molecular cloud formation, evolution, and star formation at low metallicity. The SMC is the nearest place that we can study such physical processes under conditions similar to the era of galaxy assembly. We can attain critical sub-parsec scales (1pc=3\") with ALMA, resolving the dense clumps and filaments which actually participate in star formation. NGC602 likely formed from the intersection of giant HI shells 7Myr ago, with OB star formation beginning 5Myr ago and continuing today. We have studied recent and current star formation in detail with HST and Spitzer. All that is missing is knowledge of the molecular gas. We will answer questions about each stage of molecular cloud evolution and star formation, including whether there is enhanced photodissociation at 0.2-solar metallicity, whether there is mechanically triggered star formation, and whether a GMC similar to those observed in the Milky Way is even required for active star formation at low metallicity, or whether only small dense CO clumps will be revealed.',\n"," 'Atomic carbon in a prototypical barred-spiral galaxy. Atomic carbon (CI) has been suggested as a tracer of molecular mass alternative to CO, especially in high-redshift galaxies where cosmic rays can destroy CO, or in outflows where the optical depth of CO is unknown. However, the CI abundance over the H2 abundance varies with various other factors such as turbulence, cloud age, UV field, and density. How the CI abundance changes first needs to be understood in a nearby galaxy where the physical conditions are well known. We propose a large-area CI mapping of a barred-spiral galaxy M83 to study how CI/CO changes in various location of a galaxy, namely, a galactic center, bar, arm, and interarm. We will examine the variation of CI/CO with the influence of turbulence, cosmic rays, and UV photons. The CI data will be compared with large-scale maps of CO 1-0 and 2-1 already available. Our analysis will serve as a template for nearby and high-redshift galaxies as to when CI is a reliable molecular mass tracer.',\n"," 'Tracing the Enrichment of the ISM in Extreme Starbursts. We propose to observe four sources that are undergoing or have undergone recent extreme star formation in 12CO, 13CO and C18O to trace the enichment of the ISM via stellar nucleosynthesis. The C18O traces nucleosythesis and can distinguish enrichment from pristine gas inflow. We will use the proposed observations to search for morphological evidence of enrichment, similar to that what was osberved for IRAS13120-543. We will also perform a non-LTE analysis to constrain the relative abundances of the species and compare them across the four sources and results in literature to look for any trends with merger stage.',\n"," 'Witnessing the Origin of the Interstellar Turbulence: Rapidly moving Small Scale Structures in Multi-Phase Interstellar Medium. We propose ALMA observations to detect small scale (~ a few 100 AU) cloud structures at the periphery of a molecular cloud as the origin of ubiquitously observed super-sonic turbulence driven by thermal instability. Such small scale structures are predicted by theoretical studies, and we aim to observe a direct evidence of the two-phase medium model. The preceding observations with the 45m telescope at the edge of a nearby molecular cloud have discovered small scale (a few 1000 AU) structures in 12CO (1-0) with the line width of ~ 0.6 km/s, which is significantly smaller than the typical value of 12CO in molecular cloud. It suggests that molecular cloud is composed of small-scale dense and cold structures and their overlapping effect makes it appear to be a turbulent entity as a whole. The theoretical model suggests that the cloudlets grow by coalescence of even smaller structures. It is very likely that fainter and smaller CO clouds exist but not resolved by the 45m beam. The aim of this project is to detect many small scale structures down to a few 100 AU, which will be the observational evidence supporting the theoretical two-phase turbulence model.',\n"," 'Dynamical Properties of Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies in the Peak Epoch of Star Formation. Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at high redshift are thought to be dominantly highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies that represent extreme, short-lived starbursts. This picture is supported by studies of gas dynamics, but unfortunately, the resolution of these past studies remained limited to 3-4 kpc even for the best handful of cases (with only a single exception), which is barely adequate to resolve the galaxies. Using the advanced capabilities of ALMA in cycle-2 (in particular band 8 and the longest baselines) and the magnifying effect provided by gravitational lensing, we here propose to study the [CII] gas dynamics in a large, carefully-selected sample of 14 Herschel-selected DSFGs covering the peak epoch of galaxy formation down to 100-500pc resolution. Based on uv plane lens modeling and dynamical models, we will investigate the occurence rate of major mergers vs. disks in our sample, measure dynamical masses, and constrain the physical properties of individual gas clumps down to physical scales that will only become accessible with full ALMA in unlensed galaxies at these distances. This comprehensive investigation thus will remain unrivaled for years to come.',\n"," 'Gold Standard of Dynamical Mass Estimates for z>6 Quasar Host Galaxies. The knowledge of dynamical masses of galaxies is indispensable to put galaxies in an evolutionary context. However, deriving accurate dynamical masses requires significantly resolved measurements of a bright spectral line that are typically not accessible at high redshift. This is why other estimators (~v_disp^2 D) are often employed to put first constraints on dynamical masses in unresolved (or barely resolved) observations, but the implied uncertainties are significant. Out of a sample of 27 quasar host galaxies at z>6 in which bright [CII] emission was detected with ALMA at ~0.2-0.3\" resolution, we have identified two galaxies that show large disks with apparently smooth rotation. Using a custom-made Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method, these two galaxies are prime targets to obtain accurate dynamical masses through the requested 0.09\"(500 pc) and 0.06\"(300 pc) [CII] imaging, and thus to test the applicability of low-resolution estimators. These measurements can be directly compared to the central black hole masses in these quasars, to assess how or if their black holes are over-massive compared to local scaling relations.',\n"," 'Probing the thermal properties of the chromosphere at high resolution. We propose to improve our knowledge of the thermal structuring of the solar chromosphere by obtaining the highest-resolution ALMA observations in Band 3 (100 GHz). This will build on our earlier results by measuring the key spatial scales of the temperature variations in the upper chromosphere. Our previous analysis showed that the interpretation of the millimeter-wavelength brightness temperature needed to consider radiative transfer effects to properly understand the temperature stratification along the line of sight. The higher-resolution ALMA observations, combined with other spectral diagnostics in the optical and UV, will allow us to determine how closely coupled different regions of the solar chromosphere might be. It will also allow a more robust study of the small-scale dynamics of the chromosphere.',\n"," 'CO and AGN feedback in massive galaxies. We propose to measure the molecular gas content in three massive elliptical galaxies at the centers of nearby, X-ray bright groups known to contain kpc-extended dust and cooler, multiphase gas. Many recent observational and theoretical studies of the centers of hot gas atmospheres in galaxy groups and clusters conclude that multiphase gas is evidence of non-linear radiative cooling to low temperature. Such cooling is thought to produce molecular gas visible in CO, but so far CO has been detected in only one galaxy/group, NGC5044, during ALMA cycle 0. Here we propose to test this multiphase cooling hypothesis by observing the cores of three nearby group-centered giant elliptical galaxies, all similar to NGC5044. This test is best done with galaxy groups, not clusters, because of their simplicity and proximity. In short: our ALMA observations will reveal or constrain the physical nature of the cooling-accretion-feedback cycle driven by massive central black holes in elliptical galaxies.',\n"," 'A Survey for CO(3-2) in HS1549+19, the most overdense protocluster known at z>2. We propose to map the HS1549 z=2.85 protocluster in the CO(3-2) line. HS1549 is amongst the richest system in Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters at z>2 known. We choose 35 pointings which cover all highly significant SCUBA-2 sources lying within high density subregions in the protocluster (likely cosmic web \"nodes\"), and the intervening area covered by the 70 band-3 ALMA primary beam. Our pilot NOEMA pointing targeted an especially active subregion, with 4 QSOs and 3 bright submm sources. We detected 6 sources in CO(3-2), but cannot easily interpret the results more globally in terms of galaxy density and CO luminosity function. This ALMA program will provide an efficient view of the star forming gas in a massive protocluster to understand the assembly of one of the richest regions in the Universe, but also as a lever on the CO(3-2) luminosity function and its variations within the protocluster, scaled by the galaxy density in this system. This is a resubmission of a C-rated cycle 4 proposal which has not received any data yet. The proposal has been updated, to include our wider field SCUBA-2 map over the Subaru mapped extended pro cluster.',\n"," 'Mapping CI in the beta Pictoris debris disk. The dusty debris disk around the ~20 Myr old main-sequence A-star beta Pictoris is known to contain gas. Evidence points towards a secondary origin of the gas as opposed to being a direct remnant from the initial protoplanetary phase. The dominant gas production mechanism is not identified so far, but believed to be connected to the dust. The reason for the extreme overabundance of C and O compared to metallic elements (e.g. Na, Fe) is also unknown. We propose to use ALMA to map the C I 492 GHz emission from the carbon-rich gas disk around beta Pic. By spatially and spectrally resolving the emission, ALMA will in particular address the following questions: 1) What process produces the circumstellar gas? 2) What is the mechanism behind the extreme overabundance of C in the gas disk? 3) What is the C/O ratio of the gas? Of key importance in answering these questions will be a comparison to recent ALMA observations of CO(3-2) in the disk. In addition, simultaneous observations of the dust continuum combined with archival data will map dust properties such as the grain size distribution in the disk.',\n"," 'An ALMA Search for Disks around Planetary Mass Companions. In the last decade, direct imaging surveys have discovered dozens of planetary mass companions (PMCs) at ultra-wide separations from their host stars. The origin of these objects remains unclear, as canonical planet formation theories are not effective at such high radii. Recent studies, however, suggest that these enigmatic objects may be surrounded by disks of primordial material. Direct detection and characterization of these disks provides a new avenue for studying the formation of PMCs as well as their potential exomoon systems. Here we propose to survey 7 PMCs which show indirect evidence for the presence of such a disk. With ALMA we will image those disks and calculate disk masses to constrain PMC evolutionary paths as well as the amount of material available to form exomoons. We will also use 0.1\" spatial resolution to resolve circumplanetary disks, measure their sizes and structures, search for CO (2-1) emission to measure Keplerian rotation and thereby dynamical masses for PMCs, and trace disk evolution by comparing disk morphology at different ages. This proposal is an important first step towards better understanding the formation of PMCs and exomoon systems.',\n"," 'The phase of CO in the embedded disk around the faintest protostars. We propose to observe C18O, 13CO (2-1) and N2H+ (3-2) emission toward four low-luminosity objects (LLOs, internal luminosity <0.2 Lsun), aiming to find the cold inner disks or disk-like structures with CO freeze out in the midplane. The CO snowline sets the C/O abundance in the gas and ice interior and exterior to itself, affecting the elemental ratio of planet-building material. Because planet formation may start very early, those snowline radii at the Class 0 stage are important for the chemical composition of the planets later formed. However, because of the viscous heating by accretion and the low efficiency of radiative cooling in the inner dense envelope, the early embedded disk would stay warm, preventing CO to freeze out in the majority of the disk. We found a potential cold disk with CO freeze out at the midplane in the LLO IRAS16253 (Hsieh et al. 2019). This suggests that those faintest sources, LLOs, are good condidates that host a cold disk, a unique condition of planet growth. The proposed observations aim to found such a cold disk with CO freeze out at the disk midplane in protostars at embedded phases (Class 0/I) for the first time.',\n"," 'Carbon physics across the molecular cluster medium in 4C 41.17 (z=3.8). The evolution of galaxies is tightly linked to processes in the circum- and inter-galactic medium (CGM/IGM). However, a direct connection between the CGM/IGM and the stellar growth of massive galaxies has remained missing, because we had yet to identify the ultimate reservoir of cold halo gas that has sufficient mass to fuel widespread star-formation. Recently, we mapped -for the first time- a widespread reservoir of cold molecular gas across the ~100 kpc halo of the massive Spiderweb Galaxy at z=2.2. This provided the first direct link between in-situ star formation and molecular gas in the IGM at high-z. We here propose observations of [CI] 3P1-3P0, [CI] 3P2-3P1 and [CII] in the only other forming massive cluster-galaxy with properties matching those of the Spiderweb, namely 4C41.17 at z=3.8. We will map the carbon cycle at scales ranging from the individual merging galaxies to the cluster-IGM, in order to study the molecular gas content, energy budget, and star-forming properties of the IGM. Our results will provide unique information about the role of very extended molecular gas and the history of star formation at a crucial epoch of massive galaxy evolution (z = 2.2 - 3.8).',\n"," 'Investigating the rotation velocity of the ionized gas slower than the Kepler speed in a protoplanetary disk. We propose to identify if the rotation speed of ion molecules is slower than the Kepler roation by using the ion molecule of H13CO+ toward the protopolanetary disk, HD 163296, because non-ideal MHD theory predicts that the ionized gas rotates slower than the Kepler rotation due to the Lorenz force. This slower velocity is known as ambipolar diffusion and is simply described by the magnetic field strength and the densities of neutral and ion gases. Therefore, the velocity shift would be direct evidence of the magnetic fields. By using ALMA archival data, we find a velocity shift of 0.5 km/s between DCO+ and C18O in HD 163296, suggesting a magnetic field strength of 5.7 mG at 100 au. However, DCO+ and CO may trace different layers and DCO+ was observed with coarse resolution. It is highly needed to investigate such slower rotation velocity with high spatial resolution by using the suitable molecule of H13CO+ tracing the same layer as the C18O. This is the first trial to obtain the direct evidence of the magnetic fields and estimate the magnetic field strengths of a protoplanetary disk. Even if velocity shift is not found, we can set an upper limit on the magnetic field strength.',\n"," 'Imaging the dust destruction cavity around the magnetar SGR 1900+14. Magnetars are a small class of strongly magnetized pulsars emitting extremely powerful X/gamma-ray flares on several timescales. Magnetars giant flares second in energetics, in our Galaxy, only supernova explosions: an energy of 1e45-1e47 erg is emitted in a few minutes. An infrared elliptical ring has been discovered by Spitzer surrounding the magnetar SGR1900+14, one of the three objects that ever showed a giant flare (occurred in August 1998), and which is hosted by a massive star cluster. The most probable interpretation is a dust-free cavity produced in the magnetar environment by the giant flare via different dust destruction processes, embedded in a hot dust cloud illuminated continuously by close-by massive stars. We performed 3D dust radiative transfer simulations to constrain the nature of this IR ring and its internal cavity. We ask for 3.5 hours of ALMA observation at 345 GHz to image part of this unique dust ring its the internal cavity to reveal the true origin of the elliptical ring, the dust mass involved, and have the potential to infer for the first time the anisotropy and energetic of a magnetar giant flare.',\n"," 'Obscured star formation of the brightest galaxies at z~8. The recent confirmation of luminous galaxies (MUV<-22) at z=8-11 has demonstrated that galaxy formation was well underway in the early universe, motivating a study of the brightest galaxies forming at z>=8. To this end, we used the recent UltraVISTA DR3 data and the latest IRAC observations of the SPLASH and SMUVS programs, to compile a sample of 16 bright H=24-25 (MUV = -22 to -23), massive ~10^10 Msun galaxies at z=8-10 over COSMOS. Massive galaxies are expected to be significantly obscured, based on stellar population model fits, lower redshift IRX-beta relations, and theoretical models which require substantial attenuation to match the observed UV LF. In Cycle 5, we were awarded ALMA 1.2 mm and 1.5mm continuum observations to test for the presence of dust in the 8 brightest galaxies from our sample. With this resubmission, we request time to complete the program. Our observational setup has been tuned to allow us to serendipitously detect [CII] in ~2 sources in our sample (assuming similar [CII]/SFRs as found by Smit+2018). These observations are vital to understand the bolometric properties of the galaxies and to compare to the prediction of theoretical models.',\n"," 'Magnetic Fields in High-Mass Prestellar Cores: The Missing Piece of the Puzzle. Magnetic fields (B-fields), along with turbulence and gravity, may be the key mechanisms governing the formation of high-mass stars. While turbulence and gravity have long been studied in detail, the particular role and overall importance of B-fields are yet undetermined. High-mass prestellar cores (HMPSCs; >30 M_sun) are likely precursors to high-mass stars and are predicted to be in vastly different dynamical states by different high-mass star formation theories. Only a handful of HMPSC candidates exist in the literature, and measurements of their B-fields are virtually nonexistent. The final piece of the energy puzzle thus lies in determining the relative strength of the B-field in these cores. We present a unique pilot study estimating the total energy balance in an HMPSC candidate and find relatively strong B-fields. Building upon these results, we propose to expand our sample to include 6 recently discovered HMPSC candidates. Using dust polarization (250 GHz) and line emission, we aim to investigate B-field morphologies and estimate field strengths to definitively test high-mass star formation theories.',\n"," 'First direct measurements of dust temperature in quasars at cosmic dawn. Among the >60 quasar host galaxies detected in [CII] and underlying dust continuum to date above z=6, when the universe was <1 Gyr old, only a handful have a published measurement of their dust emission in temperature-sensitive bands (at rest wavelengths <150 um). In order to infer key quantities in the characterization of these early massive galaxies, such as IR luminosities and associated star formation rates, we wildly extrapolate from the temperature-insensitive Rayleigh-Jeans part of the dust emission, or we need to assume templates. Here we propose to alleviate these restrictions by sampling the observed 400 GHz (~100 um rest-frame) dust continuum in quasars at z>6 using the ACA. We target all of the 12 quasars known at these redshifts that 1) have been already detected at 158um (rest-frame) with F_nu>1.5 mJy; 2) have not been observed in band 8 with ALMA; 3) are visible from ALMA. Each observation can be carried out within a few hours. As the quasars are spread over the sky, this program is an excellent filler for the ACA, and does not require the sensitivity nor the angular resolution of the main array.',\n"," 'Unveiling Properties of the Cold Gas Disk/Torus within the Central 1 kpc of NGC 1275. NGC1275 is a giant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Perseus cluster, which is the brightest X-ray cluster of galaxies. Contrary to other elliptical galaxies in a similar system such as M87, NGC1275 reserves a large amount of cold gas within ~1 kpc and reveals an existence of the warm H2 circumnuclear disk (CND) on the inner 50 pc. Thus, NGC1275 is the best target to study the cold gas properties in the CND, which provides a better understanding of gas accretion from the ICM to the SMBH. However, there is a missing link in the mass accretion between the outer kpc and the inner 50 pc scales because of the lack of mm observations to trace cold molecular species and dust with a high-angular resolution. Here we propose to observe the cold gas of NGC1275 at ~50 pc < R < 1 kpc using the CO(2-1) and HCO+(3-2) lines as well as the dust continuum emission with ~0.1\" (or ~35 pc) beam. With this observation, we aim to uncover i) clumpy and filamentary structures in the accretion flow, ii) connection between the CND and large scale molecular filaments, iii) thickness of the CND, and iv) the location of the Fe-K\\\\alpha lines, which is recently detected with the Hitomi satellite.',\n"," 'Resolving the massive molecular outflow G331.5. We propose to spatially resolve and to determine the gas density and temperature for a high-velocity molecular outflow in the multiple massive star forming region G331.5-0.1. This is the core of a GMC at a distance of 7.5 kpc, in the tangent of Norma spiral arm, a counterpart to the northern W43 GMC but in the peak of the southern molecular ring. The outflow is among the most massive and energetic discovered so far (flow mass 55 Mo , momentum 2.4 e3 Mo km/s and kinetic energy 1.4 e48 ergs). The region contains 6 massive dust concentrations, mapped in the mm continuum with SIMBA and LABOCA, with a total luminosity of 3.6 e6 Lo, about 10 times larger than the typical value for massive star forming regions in the Galactic disk. The outflow was discovered and preliminary characterized through APEX and ASTE molecular line observations. The proposed ALMA observations will permit to spatially resolve the outflow; the SiO at different frequencies will allow to determine rotational temperatures and densities for the outflow; and the H13CO+ lines will yield the properties of the ambient gas.',\n"," 'Deep Dive into the ISM at z=6 with ALMA + JWST: From the Individual Lensed Star to 1-20pc Star-Forming Clumps. Recent HST and JWST/NIRCam studies have identified strongly lensed star clusters and even individual stars out to z=6, offering us new hope of directly observing such compact systems and their local environments at cosmological distances. Here we propose ALMA [CII]158um observations of the most highly magnified (mu~300) low-mass dwarf galaxy (2e9 Msun) hosting the strongly lensed star, Earendel (Welch+22, Nature), whose redshift has been confirmed at z=5.93 in the latest JWST/NIRSpec observations. In the 16\" long lensed arc, the recent NIRCam observations also map out diffuse ISM gas as well as several compact clumps that are the most distant known bound massive star clusters, with radii between 1 and 20pc, the size of local star clusters. This program aims to complete the initial FIR characterization from the full (~16\") lensed arc to the individual small clumps by obtaining their total fluxes and distributions of the [CII] emission line and the dust continuum via the combination of the compact and extended configurations. This is an essential step to design future further high-resolution follow-up to study e.g., even the rotation of the individual star clusters at z=6.',\n"," 'An Unbiased Search for High Velocity Winds in local (U)LIRGs using the 7m Array. We propose to use ALMA 7m array stand alone observations to carry out a complete, flux-limited, survey of 14 equatorial (U)LIRGs in the GOALS sample. The main goal is to obtain a high SNR measurement of the CO(2-1) line in order to test for the presence of high velocity components, >500 km/s, that would indicate the presence of outflows in these sources. This will allow us to estimate the incidence of molecular outflows in a statistical sample of star forming galaxies and test for possible dependences on physical parameters such as star formation rate, presence of AGN, merger stage, etc. Molecular outflows have been shown to be potentially critical in galaxy transformations and therefore a fundamental ingredient in our understanding of galaxy evolution. This program takes full advantage of the unique 7m array as a standalone facility, will provide short spacing data for ALMA 12m observations of the sample and will greatly enhance the rich multiwavelength data available for these sources, thus ensuring the strong legacy value of this proposed dataset.',\n"," 'Mapping multi-phase outflows in three nearby z~2 galaxy analogs. Galactic winds are ubiquitous in star-forming galaxies at z>1, and star formation feedback is now a fundamental component of star formation theory and galaxy evolution models. However, only a few galaxies with outflows at z>1 have been observed in CO, and there are no cases where the multi-phase properties (molecular, atomic, ionized) of high-z outflows is known. Due to this severe lack of data, fundamental properties of outflows (size, mass, etc) are poorly constrained, and a key quantity the mass outflow rate remains uncertain at the order-of-magnitude level. Because we do not have a full description of outflowing gas we still do not have a full picture of the evolution of star forming clumps in z~2 galaxies. The key missing piece of information is the outflowing molecular gas. We propose to map in CO(3-2) line emission the star-formation driven outflows at 1 kpc resolution in 3 galaxies at z~0.1 from the DYNAMO sample. Our clumpy, gas-rich target galaxies are identical in properties to typical systems at z~2. By combining in hand Keck data with the proposed ALMA data we will obtain the first measurement of the full multi-phase outflows from these intense star forming regions.',\n"," 'Anatomy of a jet-cloud interaction and starburst in Minkowskis Object. What happens when the relativistic jet from an AGN impacts a gas cloud? This question is difficult to answer observationally given the lack of well-studied examples, but is important given that it may have important implications for our understanding of feedback. Radio jet induced star formation was common in the early Universe, but only a handful of low redshift analogues are known. Among them, Minkowskis Object (z=0.02), with a clear jet-cloud interaction and starburst, stands out. Although extensively studied in the optical, UV and radio, only ALMA has the sensitivity to study the jet-cloud interaction in molecular gas. The aims of this proposal are: (1) to study the detailed distribution of molecular gas in relation to the HI cloud and the star formation region, (2) to study the detailed dynamics of the interaction on a smaller spatial scale than possible in HI, and compare to numerical simulations, (3) to search for evidence of feedback by the starburst on the interstellar medium in the form of an outflow of molecular gas, and (4) to estimate the total mass of molecular gas and investigate the extent to which this unusual object obeys the Schmidt-Kennicutt law.',\n"," 'Resolved [CII]/CO/dust survey of the star-forming ISM at z=2-4. We propose the first systematic survey of the [CII]/CO/dust continuum on ~2 kpc-scales in a carefully selected sample of 8 z=2-4 DSFGs, with a total of 18 hours in Bands 3/8/9, following a successful pilot study of resolved CO/[CII] emission in a sample of 4(2) z~2.5 SMGs. By resolving the three main tracers of the star-forming ISM on 2-kpc scales in these bright, unlensed targets, this survey will be a dramatic improvement over the previous unresolved multi-tracer studies at z>2. This resolved multi-tracer study will: (1) determine the relation of [CII] emission to obscured star-formation, molecular gas and stellar populations (in combination with deep HST imaging); (2) test the applicability of local SF laws to z>2 systems; and (3) study the ISM properties on kpc-scales. By revealing the relationship of [CII] to the two key ISM tracers in these easily accessible z=2-4 galaxies, this study will have important implications for interpreting the increasingly common [CII] studies at redshifts >4.',\n"," 'Deep CO (3-2) and continuum survey of Rosette Nebula globulettes. Our previous optical, NIR, (sub)mm single dish and ALMA observations and modelling of very tiny molecular clouds, globulettes, that reside in H II regions surrounding young stellar clusters, open a number of questions regarding their nature and fate. How long can they survive in the hot nebular gas and UV radiation field? Are they gravitationally unstable to form free-floating planetary mass objects and low-mass brown dwarfs to be ejected into interstellar space? We propose a CO (3-2) and 340GHz continuum survey of 27 Rosette Nebula globulettes of different sizes and shapes. The point source three sigma continuum detection limit will 5 be Jupiter masses. The observations will show what percentage of the globulettes have dense cores, are there associated continuum point sources or dust continuum emission, allow to estimate the Rosette globulette mass and velocity dispersion distribution, are the smallest globulettes in the last stage before evaporating in the hard UV radiation field and in particular, are the globulettes a viable source of brown dwarfs and free floating planets. The project will thus have an impact on the wider field of planet and low-mass star formation.',\n"," 'Unveiling the Dustiest Galaxies in the Universe with ALMA. Using new ultra-deep near-infrared data from the UltraVISTA survey, we have uncovered a remarkable population of massive galaxies at z ~ 2 that appear to have extraordinary dust obscuration of their stellar populations, Av = 3.0 - 5.0. This amount of obscuration is substantially more than seen in submillimeter galaxies, which typically have Av = 1.5 - 2.5. If truly this dusty, this population are undoubtedly the most dust-obscured galaxies yet seen. The largest uncertainty with these galaxies are their redshifts, as even with ultra-deep 38-band UV/IR/MIR photometric data, the lack of strong features in their SEDs leaves considerable uncertainty in the photometric redshift, and hence the total dust content. They are far too faint for conventional optical/NIR spectroscopy (R < 27.5, H < 24.5), so we request Band 6 spectral scans for the four most strongly star-forming of these galaxies. Our primary goal is to detect multiple CO transitions to pinpoint both their spectroscopic redshift and to measure approximate gas fractions. Once redshifts for this population are confirmed, this will open up an exciting opportunity to study a new population of extraordinarily dusty galaxies.',\n"," 'CH+ lines in starburst galaxies at redshift z=2~4: probes of massive turbulent gas reservoirs. Turbulence is a critical process in the growth of galaxies in the early Universe. Whether it is fed by gas infall, stellar or AGN feedback, turbulence acts as a long-lived mass and energy buffer. The unique properties of the CH+ cation make it a robust tracer of turbulent dissipation and energy injection rate. In our Cycle 2 project, we detected the first CH+(1-0) lines in 7 strongly-lensed starburst galaxies at redshifts ~2. Deep absorptions reveal hidden massive reservoirs of turbulent low-density gas that can sustain the high SFR. Extremely broad emission lines trace major energy releases, the origin of which is open. This proposal is designed to further grasp the origin of turbulence. We will 1) extend the sample with 8 starburst galaxies over a broader range of redshifts and SFR, with and without AGN signatures. This will identify the impact of stellar- or AGN-driven feedback on the CH+ lines, and 2) observe the two brightest Cycle 2 targets at higher angular resolution to localize the sites of CH+ emission. If found at the outskirts of the dust continuum images, they would reveal large scale shocks generated by the impact of cold streams infalling upon the starburst galaxies.',\n"," 'Outflow structure of the young protostar Lupus 3 MMS. We propose Band 6 observations of CO isotopologues and continuum to study the outflow of the Class 0 source Lupus 3 MMS. In Cycle 3 we mapped the Band 3 CO(1-0) line, and uncovered a bipolar outflow extending up to 2 arc-minutes in each lobe. The lobes have well-defined cavity walls and evidence for episodic ejection events. In Cycle 5 we propose complementary observations of CO(2-1) in order to achieve the observation goals of the original program, performed with the same angular- and spectral-resolution. This is required to permit accurate estimates of outflow physical parameters and structure by multi-line analysis of the optical depth and excitation temperature structure throughout the outflow, especially critical in shock regions. Utilizing 12 metre + ACA observations from CO(2-1) in Cycle 5 and CO(1-0) in Cycle 3 we can accurately assess outflow mass, momentum, and force. This is a particularly interesting source because accretion has only very recently begun, and we will use its outflow as a proxy for the accretion history, and thus permitting us to reveal the time-dependent aspects of accretion onto low mass protostars in the earliest evolutionary stage.',\n"," 'Measuring the Emission of Stellar Atmospheres at Submillimeter/Millimeter Wavelengths. Our understanding of stellar atmospheres and our ability to infer architectures of extrasolar planetary systems rely on understanding the emission of stars at millimeter wavelengths. We propose to use ALMA to determine the stellar emission of Sirius A in Bands 3 - 5, as well as $\\\\gamma$ Lep and $\\\\gamma$ Vir in Bands 6 - 7. The proposed observations will be used (1) to determine submillimeter/millimeter intrinsic stellar fluxes for the sampled A and F stars and (2) to evaluate potential variability in the stellar emission. These observations are fundamental to testing stellar atmosphere models, are essential for evaluating the occurrence rate of stellar excess (used to infer the presence of unresolved dust), and are required for determining the dust spectral indices at the proposed wavelength',\n"," 'Magnetic Fields in High-Mass Star Formation. [This is a re-submission of a previously approved B-rank proposal (2017.1.00101.S) from cycle 5. No data delivery by the time of submission, if the data are still delivered, this proposal will be obsolete.] Polarization observations are finally feasible for large samples, allowing to reveal their importance in high-mass star formation. For the first time, we aim to carry out a complete picture of the energy balance of high-mass star-forming regions at the scales directly related to the star-forming process (500-1,000 AU). By observing 31 high-mass star-forming regions, containing >60 cores, we will determine: i) what is the relative balance between turbulence, gravity, and magnetic fields? is this balance universal or variable? ii) and, with the help of numerical simulations, what control the different fragmentation scenarios observed in our sample. We have assembled a strong team for such a large program, including experts in ALMA data, polarization observations, and numerical simulations.',\n"," 'Understanding the Excitation of Molecular Gas in the Quasar-Starburst Systems at z>6. The cold interstellar medium (ISM) in the quasar-starburst systems at high redshift is crucial for probing the early growth of the first super massive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. We propose an ALMA survey of the CO (9-8) line in nine quasars at 6.06 quasars will allow us to investigate the connections of the high-to-mid-J CO line ratio to the AGN luminosities and the local ISM properties including the dust SED/color/temperature, FIR luminosity, obscured column density, etc. Bright emission from very high-J CO transitions (J>9~17) was detected in several quasar host galaxies at z>6, suggesting contribution from AGN power in the gas excitation. Here we propose the first study to statistically explore the correlation between the CO excitation and the AGN power. The results will also motivate further observations of the full CO SLEDs for a larger sample and the detailed studies of ISM excitation mechanisms to understand the evolution of ISM in the young quasar host galaxies at the earliest epoch.',\n"," 'Hidden Gems on a Ring: Resolving Embedded Young Massive Clusters in a Nearby Ringed Galaxy. We aim to understand the earliest phase of massive cluster formation with resolved observations of embedded young massive clusters (YMCs) around the starburst ring in the nearby galaxy M95. Leveraging lower-resolution data from a Cycle 8 program, we will observe extinction-free tracers of dust, dense molecular gas, and star formation in Band 3 and Band 7 at 0.05\" = 2.5 pc scales. Complemented by a rich multiwavelength data inventory (VLA, VLT, HST, and JWST), our proposed ALMA observations will allow us to: (1) conclusively identify forming massive clusters at the earliest, heavily embedded stage, (2) characterize the impact of stellar feedback processes on YMCs, and (3) compare the physical properties of YMCs in different host systems. This will be just the fourth embedded YMC population study with resolved data down to ~2 pc scales and, more importantly, the first in a relatively face-on host system. With reliable measurements of YMC sizes, masses, gas fractions, feedback-related characteristics, and by connecting the YMCs to their ambient ISM and galactic environments, we will provide unique observational constraints for massive cluster formation theories and simulations.',\n"," 'Phosphine in a prestellar core. Phosphorous-bearing molecules, such as nucleic acids and phospholipids, are essential for life on Earth. Then, understanding in which chemical forms phosphorous exists in star- and planet-forming regions and how phosphorus is delivered to planets are of great interest from the view point of the origin of life on Earth. Phosphine (PH3) is thought to be a key species to understand the phosphorous chemistry, but never has been detected in star- and planet-forming regions. We propose ACA stand-alone observations of PH3 toward a prestellar core. The first detection of PH3 will allow us to evaulate the amount of elemental phosphorous available for gas-ice chemistry in the prestellar core.',\n"," 'The First Ever Low Metallicity PDR Benchmark: Revealing the CO-Dark H2. We propose ALMA observations of CO and [CI] emission lines in a low metallicity PDR that is the target of upcoming JWST observations. In Cycle 1, an approved GO program will observe the N13 PDR in the Small Magellanic Cloud using the NIRSpec and MIRI intergral field units with resolution that will locate the transitions from ionized to atomic to molecular hydrogen (H+/H/H2) and map the physical state of the gas and dust. At low metallicity, a key prediction of PDR models is that the transition from atomic carbon to carbon monoxide (C/CO) will occur deeper in the PDR compared to higher metallicity regions, due to decreased dust shielding. This prediction is central to explaining the prevalence of ``CO-Dark H2 at low metallicities, but it has never been directly tested due to the lack of observations that can resolve both the H/H2 and C/CO transition of a PDR in a low metallicity environment. This is now possible for the first time with the pairing of ALMA and JWST. These proposed observations will be critical tests for CO and [CI] as molecular gas tracers at low metallicity and provide the first resolved benchmark for low metallicity PDR models.',\n"," 'Fully characterization of streamers in the embedded phases of star formation. The classic picture of star formation follows the evolution of an isolated spherical dense core. In this picture all the material used in the star and planet formation process must go through the dense core. Clearly this an idealization, but it has helped to move forward our understanding of star formation. Recent observations have revealed streamers of gas toward objects at different evolutionary stages (from embedded Class 0 to more evolved Class II sources). This evidence for non-sperical accretion could deliver an important amount of mass and with a large enough mass infall rate that could severly change the disk formation and evolution process. Unfortunately, until now no systematic study has been able to determine the streamers full lengths and properties. This proposal will observe a sample of 8 objects with strong suggestions for streamers in a systematic fashion to address these questions. These observations will enable the direct kinematical confirmation of the full extent of these streamers, and it will allow for a comparison of the properties across different evolutionary stages.',\n"," 'ACA Study on the Driving Mechanisms of Starburst and Main-Sequence Star Formation in Local Galaxies. We propose an ACA stand-alone observation in 12CO (J=2-1) emission line of 56 local galaxies to reveal the driving mechanism of different star formation modes in galaxies, starburst and main-sequence star formation. The two modes are described on the stellar mass - star formation rate plane. The previous studies have found that starburst galaxies often involved with galaxy mergeres and have more compact star-forming regions than main-sequence galaxies. These results imply that galaxy mergers drive compressed gas and resultant high activities of star formation. However, this picture is observationally unclear because the information on the extent of molecular gas distribution in galaxies is poor. Therefore, we systematically measure the CO extent of the galaxies with the ACAs resolutions (6\"). Our sample widely ranges from main-sequence galaxis to starbursts, and is composed of 35 disk galaxies and 21 mergers. This observation enable us to directly compare between star formation levels, morphologies, and extents of molecular gas distribution.',\n"," 'Probing the in-fall disk in the giant elliptical galaxy NGC 5128. Please Note: This is a request finish an already-started and mostly completed project. Many large elliptical galaxies contain embedded disks of dust and gas, remnants of a merger with a smaller gas-rich galaxy. The physical properties of such disks, and the resulting initial conditions for star formation are very different from those in disk galaxies and starburst galaxies. We will study these in detail by modelling the molecular gas in the embedded dusty gas disk (``dark band) of the only nearby giant elliptical, NGC~5128 (Centaurus A). We will apply PDR and radiative-transfer models to the 12CO and 13CO J=1-0 and J=2-1 line transitions in maps of 20 pc resolution over the inner several kpc of the galaxy. We will specifically deduce the gas mass and temperature, for individual clumps and the whole disk as a function of radius, and investigate the relation of the dense molecular gas conditions to the enhanced star formation in the disk. The proximity of NGC 5128 and its present evolutionary stage about halfway between acquisition and final consumption of a gas-rich galaxy provide a unique opportunity to study an advanced merger state in detail.',\n"," 'The Birth of Giants: Assembly of the First Massive Galaxies. Over the last decade, a coherent picture of the Universe during the epoch of reionisation has started to emerge. High-redshift quasar spectra have undoubtedly been the most polyvalent tools in the exploration of the first Gyr of the Universe. To obtain a pan-chromatic legacy sample of the brightest quasars at z~6, we have recently been awarded an ESO Large Programme (XQR-30) to obtain optical/near-infrared spectra of the highest quality in a carefully selected sample. Here we request ~1.5 kpc (0.3\") resolution ALMA [CII] imaging of this sample of quasars. These observations are critical for a number of reasons: (a) characterise the host galaxy that cannot be traced in the optical/near-infrared and spatially resolve star formation and gas surface densities; (b) provide accurate systemic redshifts that are crucial to fully exploit the optical spectroscopy; (c) pin-down the frequency of merging events in z>6 quasar hosts. Together with accurate black hole masses from XQR-30, the ALMA data will also put the targeted quasars in the framework of the black hole-host galaxy co-evolution paradigm and shed light on the formation of the first massive galaxies.',\n"," 'Characterising the gas and dust distribution in the disc surrounding IM Lupi. The first steps of planet formation are believed to be the growth of initially small, micrometric dust grains and their decoupling from the gas phase via vertical settling and radial migration. IM Lupi is an ideal laboratory to validate and quantify these theories. It is a southern T Tauri star with one of the best characterised protoplanetary disc. We have performed extensive modelling of the currently available data and showed that the disc displays strong evidence of dust evolution: grain growth and vertical settling. We propose to obtain band 3 and band 6 continuum and CO isotopologues observations to map the spatial distribution of the millimetre-sized dust grains and molecular gas and to compare them with the spatial distribution of micrometric grains observed in the near-infrared. The disc is large, bright in the molecular lines and at an intermediate inclination (50 degrees) making it an ideal target to accurately locate both the dust and gas components. These observations will allow us to unambiguously constrain the degree of radial migration of the dust grains and determine how strong is the dynamical coupling between gas and dust.',\n"," 'Extreme feedback in a cool core cluster at z=0.2. We propose to detect and measure with ALMA the cold molecular gas reservoir that feeds the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) within the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) sitting at the centre of the cool core cluster Abell 2667 at z=0.234. We will observe the CO[3-2] transition in band 7, with an angular resolution of 0.3\" (corresponding to 1.1kpc at the redsfhit of the cluster), in order to spatially map its complex structure, that extends for roughly 30kpc. Eventually, we will combine the ALMA cold gas maps with the spatially resolved optical spectroscopy from MUSE (GTO program 094.A-0115(A), P.I. J. Richard) that reveals the presence of multiple gas components with different velocities with respect to the BCG rest-frame. We also aim at spectrally resolving the CO line, to detect multiple gas motions as for the ionized component, and eventual molecular outflows (suggested by the presence of blueshifted emission lines in MUSE data). The existence of shallower ALMA data in the archive allowed us to carefully predict the required sensitivity to reach our science goals, that will basically test the effect of feedback on the inner environment of (one) cool core cluster.',\n"," 'An ACA CO survey: Identifying the best candidates for (approximately less than 2% precision) Black Hole mass measurements. It is now well established that nearly all galaxies have a supermassive central black hole (SMBH) whose mass scales with host galaxy properties, but we are still short of understanding the underlying physics. Our interpretations of black hole mass and black hole (and AGN) evolution at all redshifts are effectively based on the M-$\\\\sigma$ relation, but we are at the limits of few hundred data points with substantial measurement uncertainties and systematics. Additional high-precision data, and a better understanding of the systematics between different methods, is required to find the connection between galaxies and their SMBHs. ALMA is potentially capable of measuring several hundred SMBH masses, but the measurement technique requires validation. We propose ACA imaging of CO J:3-2 and continuum in a sample of 28 galaxies whose SMBH sphere of influence is >=0.16arcsec. Our primary goal is to (a) identify all candidates for future high precision measurements of CO-based SMBH mass and (b) constrain the galaxy potential with kpc-scale gas dynamics. This will allow validation of CO-based (and alternative) SMBH estimates made at lower resolution.',\n"," 'Timing the Disappearance of Molecular Gas in Post-Starburst Galaxies. Theoretical predictions of the \"quenching\" process predict that the absence of molecular gas (via e.g., depletion, removal, or heating) should precede the cessation of star formation. However, recent ALMA CO(2-1) observations have revealed that many (5/12) post-starburst galaxies retain significant gas reservoirs (log(M/M_sun)~10) in the 100 Myr after they shut down their primary epoch of star formation--and afterwards H2 is undetected. Though individually undetected, older (>100 Myr) post-starburst galaxies are constrained to have gas masses an order of magnitude lower than the young ones, even though the depletion times from star formation are ~25 Gyr. We propose an optimized survey which spans the full range of post-starburst properties and would detect all previously detected galaxies at SN>3. By doubling the initial ALMA investment, this survey will almost quadruple the size of the sample, thereby assembling the largest comprehensive sample of H2 measurements in quenched galaxies outside of the local Universe. This statistical census will conclusively describe disappearing H2 reservoirs and evolutionary timescales that will inform quenching models and cosmological simulations.',\n"," 'The most comprehensive survey of dense gas in high-z galaxies. We request 25 hours of ALMA Band 1 observations to conduct the largest-ever survey of dense gas tracers (HCN, HCO+, HNC) in high-z dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). While high-z galaxies have been extensively studied in molecular gas (via CO and [CII]) and obscured star formation (dust continuum), the link between these two - their dense gas (>10^4 cm-3), typically traced by HCN, HCO+ and HNC - is almost completely unexplored. Recent studies suggest that high-z DSFGs are surprisingly lacking in dense gas while having significantly elevated star-forming efficiencies. However, these claims are based on a handful of galaxies, most of which are non-detections. To understand the star-forming processes in DSFGs, it is necessary to move to larger samples and robust detections. We propose deep observations of the Jupp=2 transitions of HCN, HCO+ and HNC in ten strongly lensed galaxies from the SPT sample. By measuring the dense-gas content in the largest-ever sample of high-z galaxies to an unprecedented depth, this project will gather more data than all the previous dense-gas studies combined, providing the first clear view of dense gas in high-redshift galaxies.',\n"," 'CO Imaging of Ultraluminous Infrared QSO Hosts. CO survey of the host galaxies of ultraluminous infrared QSOs (IR QSOs) reveals a massive reservoir of molecular gas and confirms that the FIR emission of IR QSOs are mainly from star formation (SF). We propose to map 8 IR QSOs at z=0.061-0.190 showing the strongest CO emission to study the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas on sub-kpc scale with the ALMA. This will be the first attempt to systematically probe the ~1 kpc nuclear regions of IR QSOs where SF/AGN activities play important roles in shaping up the galaxy evolution (once combining with few nearest IR QSOs that have been imaged in CO, e.g., MrK 231). With the accurate measurements of CO size and kinematics, we can study the M_BH-M_bulge relation and the kinematic signature of molecular gas around black holes in the IR QSO phase. The high resolution ALMA observations will also enable us to resolve the size and geometry of molecular outflows in the hosts of IR QSOs. Together with the multi-wavelength studies of local ULIRGs and PG QSOs, the systematic studies of IR QSOs will help us better understand the co-evolution of starbursts and AGNs as well as provide the best examined local analogues to those at high-z.',\n"," 'ALMA observations of Hydra-A - Resolving a cold gas disk. We propose to map the cold gas disk that appears to be fueling the powerful radio galaxy Hydra-A by observing the CO(2-1) line at 250pc resolution.

Very deep Chandra observations of the intracluster medium set very reliable constraints on the amount of energy that has been inject mechanically into the central region of the cluster over the past 1Gyr due to the favourable viewing angle we have to Hydra-A with the jets in the plane of the sky.

Anomalous microwave emission (AME) is a dust-correlated radio emission with a spectrum peaking around 20-60 GHz. It is thought to originate from small dust grains spinning at GHz frequencies. It has been observed in different Galactic environments but the carriers of this emission mechanism remain unidentified. Until now, most of the observations of AME have been performed at moderate angular resolution (> arcmin) which do not allow for a clear identification of the AME emitters. We have detected for the first time AME at high (~3 arcsec) angular resolution using the VLA at 27.5 GHz in the reflection nebula NGC 2023. These observations show a strong morphological correlation with PAH emission at 8um. We propose ALMA + ACA Band 4 observations in order to map the thermal dust emission from the cloud at similar angular scales as our VLA data. With these observations we will be able to confirm that the emission seen by the VLA does not correspond to thermal dust. Moreover, we will be able to make detailed morphological comparison between both data sets and additional IR templates in order to identify which are the carriers of the AME.',\n"," 'G267: testing the physics of star-forming filaments. Filaments are structures that assemble within the molecular clouds and are the preferential sites to find dense young clumps and cores. Although they seem to be an important phase in the whole star formation process, the question if the properties of young forming stars are related or influenced by the properties of the hosting filament is still open. Part of the reason is our largely insufficient knowledge of the physics of filaments, their interaction with the surrounding environment and with the hosted cores during their evolution. This proposal is intended to contribute with the complete characterization of the physics and kinematics of a nearby large-scale rectilinear and isolated filament with active star formation in different mass and stages of evolution. With complete ACA band 3 mapping of lines and continuum of this scaled-up version in mass and size of the Taurus filament, we will measure how the filament accretes from its surrounding, the rate of material transport along its spine and its relation to the position, properties and evolutionary stages of hosted dense clumps, and determine how these parameters compare to well-studied filaments of lower mass.',\n"," 'Elucidating the origin of small high-velocity compact clouds in the central 10 pc of our Galaxy. The central molecular zone of our Galaxy harbors a number of high-velocity compact clouds (HVCCs), which are a peculiar population of spatially compact (d < 10 pc) molecular clouds with extremely broad velocity widths (dV > 50 km/s). We have recently discovered two small (d ~1 pc) HVCCs (sHVCCs) in HCN J=4-3 and J=3-2 maps obtained with the JCMT. Both of these sHVCCs have similar physical properties, emanating from larger dense clouds in the position-velocity spaces. One has a faint counterpart in a Paschen-alpha image. In order to uncover the nature and the origin of these sHVCCs, we propose high-resolution observations in HCN J=4-3 and H26 alpha lines. The possible origin of the sHVCCs is (1) outflow from a deeply embedded massive protostar, (2) supernova explosion in the recent past, (3) cloud-cloud collision, or (4) high-velocity plunge of an invisible massive compact object into a molecular cloud. The ALMA images enable us to discriminate which process has formed the sHVCCs. This project should contribute to our understanding of these anomalous objects which could belong to a previously unrecognized population.',\n"," 'Unveiling the Chemical Complexity at the Edge of our Galaxy. The outer part of our Galaxy is an excellent laboratory to study star formation and interstellar medium in a Galactic low-metallicity environment. The recent discovery of a hot molecular core at the edge of our Galaxy has suggested that a great molecular complexity exists even in a primordial low-metallicity environment of the outer Galaxy. However, detailed chemical compositions of outer Galaxy star-forming cores are investigated only for a single object, and thus their chemical diversity is still unknown. Here we propose ALMA observations to search for hot cores in five star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy, where the metallicity is lower than the solar neighborhood by a factor of at least three. We propose Band 7 observations towards 16 embedded protostar candidates, which were identified by a near-infrared imaging survey with the Gemini-South and IRSF telescopes. This first comprehensive survey of hot cores for the outer Galaxy will provide the community with unprecedented molecular line datasets for low-metallicity star-forming regions in the Galaxy.',\n"," 'The magnetic field structure in and around the Orion KL outflow. We propose to observe the dense cores surrounding the Orion BN/KL outflow in Band 7 continuum and CO J(3-2) in full-polarization mode for the first time. These observations will build on previous studies of the large-scale magnetic field geometry in the OMC 1 region made by the JCMT BISTRO (B-Fields in Star-forming Region Observations) Survey, and on SMA observations of the BN/KL region, in order to build a complete picture of the magnetic field morphology and energetics in OMC 1 on scales from 0.1 pc to 200 AU, and to achieve the first direct measurement of the magnetic field strength in the BN/KL outflow through observation of the Goldreich-Kylafis effect. Our proposed observations will elucidate the role of magnetic fields in constraining outflows, and of outflows in shaping the geometries of their local magnetic fields. They will allow investigation of the energy balance of OMC 1 on a variety of size scales, in order to determine the relative importance of and role played by the magnetic field in the evolution of this highly complex and non-equilibrium environment.',\n"," 'Are GMCs Real? Searching for the physical objects in a multiscale ISM. We propose fully-sampled observations of 12CO/13CO/C18O(2-1) of a 5 kpc-square box in NGC253, probing scales from 5 pc to 5000 pc. These observations will allow us to search for the signatures of bound molecular clouds in the ISM on a wide range of scales around the canonical cloud size of 50 pc. Identifying such a preferred scale will prove the view that Giant Molecular Clouds are well defined entities, but the lack of such a scale would support the view that what we observe as GMCs are just part of a larger hierarchical ISM and should not be regarded as real objects. We will use a dendrogram-based measure of the gravitational binding on a full range of scales to isolate this signature. We will also measure the properties of turbulence and angular momentum using techniques drawn from the literature. The observations will join a small number of complementary, archival data sets of sufficient quality for multiscale analysis. This will enable a robust, three-dimensional view of the molecular ISM.',\n"," 'Towards a census of star-formation since z~6 with ALMA-1.1mm. We propose to carry out a wide (10x6.8) and deep (128 microJy rms) ALMA 1.1mm survey in GOODS-South requiring 21.9 hrs of observing time. The combined power of ALMA and Herschel will probe the dust (hence also gas) content and SFR (hence SFE=SFR/Mgas) of galaxies out to z=3.5. It will also open a new window on previously undiscovered dusty star formation out to z~6-8, an era previously studied only with UV emission and untested extinction corrections. With ALMAs exquisite angular resolution and sensitivity, >4-10 times deeper than existing sub-mm surveys, these data will provide the missing link between the obscured and unobscured Universe, allowing the deconfusion of Herschel data and permitting statistical studies of galaxy populations via detections and stacking. Our team brings together astronomers with extensive experience with the GOODS-S multi-wavelength dataset, especially Herschel, JVLA, HST and Chandra. In comparison to the previous Cycle 1 ALMA 1.3mm survey in the HUDF, we will cover a 17x wider area, detect 5-7 times more sources, and reach a complete census on the cosmic SFR density of M*>3-4x10^10 Msun galaxies over z=0-6 with ~0.15 dex uncertainty.',\n"," 'The secret lives of BADGRS. We have discovered a very nearby population of extremely blue galaxies with Log M* = 7.5-9.5 Msun and high gas fractions (50-95%) that also have the highest specific dust masses of any local population. They have extended and clumpy starformation and H2/dust ratios over an order of magnitude lower than typical star forming spiral galaxies, depsite reasonably high metallicities (0.8Zsun). Their inferred molecular gas depletion times are ~250 Myr, overlapping with those in LIRGs and ULIRGs but at ×100 lower LIR. Instead, these sources represent a far more common phase of galaxy evolution; comprising more than half the galaxies discovered in the Herschel- ATLAS local volume sample. They are full of paradoxes - dusty but transparent, UV bright but with cold dust and high gas fraction but high enrichment. We will explore their dust properties, CO dark gas components, the effects of cosmic rays on CO, disk stability and conditions for H2 formation. Our ALMA observations will probe diffuse and dense gas tracers and dust emission on GMC scales (~70 pc) revealing the secrets of these gas rich and potentially unstable disks.',\n"," 'mm polarization properties of the flaring jet during a new pecular accretion state in microquasar GRS 1915+105. Polarization observations in the millimeter regime are crucial in determining the magnetic field structure close to the jet base in active galactic nuclei and providing discriminatory power in the determination of the proper model for the jet structure. However, mm-band linear polarization measurements are lacking from jets around stellar-mass black holes. Given their small black hole masses, they evolve through a wide range of accretion rates on timescales accessible to people providing unique opportunities to study jet evolution. Here, we propose an ALMA observation of a transient black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 that has recently changed radio properties from a nearly quenched state to a flaring state indicating an activation of the jet. Also, X-ray observations show signs of obscuration, that has never been seen before. We would like to use this unique opportunity to study the mm polarization properties of the flaring jet in GRS 1915+105 with ALMA together with supporting X-ray observations. This data would provide us a quantitative understanding of the physics involved in jet production and its connection to the accretion flow in this peculiar state of accretion.',\n"," 'Revealing the molecular gas content of low-metallicity low mass strongly lensed galaxies. In the past decades, studies of massive high-z galaxies have revealed a strong relation between molecular gas and the rates and timescales of star formation. When exploring the lower mass range with, the help of gravitational lensing, galaxies have appeared to have less gas and/or to use their gas more rapidly than expected . This apparent gas deficit (relative to massive galaxies) can either be due to the systematic uncertainties of tracer-to-gas calibrations or to a fundamentally different mode of star formation taking place in these lower mass galaxies, but testing this can only be addressed with larger samples. Here we propose CO and dust continuum observations with ACA of six low-mass strongly-lensed star-forming galaxies at z~2-3. These observations will significantly expand the current sample of gas measurements in such objects, with the goal of improving statistics to confirm (or discard) the observed deficit. Additionally, by using two independent tracers we address some of uncertainties of tracer-to-gas calibrations. Finally, ACA and its large FOV and beam sizes is the best suited instrument to perform this survey.',\n"," 'Direct Imaging of Vertical Structure in an Edge-On Protoplanetary Disk. Protoplanetary disks are proposed to be characterized by radial and vertical gradients in density, temperature, ionization, radiation flux and chemistry. Spatially resolved ALMA SV and cycle 0 observations of molecular lines have confirmed the presence of radial temperature and chemical structures in disks, while constraints on the vertical structures remain scarce. We propose to exploit the exceptional spatial resolution of ALMA and the viewing geometry of the edge-on disk AA Tau to obtain the first direct imaging constraints on the vertical chemical and ionization structure in a protoplanetary disk. We will target molecules and ions proposed to trace the disk atmosphere, warm molecular layer and cold midplane to benchmark our understanding of how disk structures and chemistry depend on disk height.',\n"," 'Star formation in a massive z=2.91 halo fed by cold accretion. We recently discovered and spectroscopically confirmed a structure consistent with a forming, single massive halo at z=2.91 in the COSMOS field. With a total mass of ~5x10^13Msun, this is the highest redshift bonafide cluster/group known. Keck/KCWI observations revealed a luminous Lya nebula well centered on the stellar mass overdensity, surrounded by three filaments with a factor of >10 lower surface brightness, extending over a 320pkpc diameter out to the virial radius. A variety of observables suggest that we are a textbook-case of cold accretion onto a massive high-z halo. Existing multiwavelength data, including an ALMA 2min snapshot, only scratch the surface of the star formation content of this system. We propose to image with ALMA at 870um an area of 20x40 fully covering the cluster candidate and associated Lya nebula, enabling detection of any galaxy with >10Msun/yr, about 40x deeper than current limits. We will unveil the luminosity and spatial distribution of star forming galaxies in this unique structure, enabling us to study directly the connection between cold streams and the feeding of star formation in galaxies in one of the earliest forming structures known.',\n"," 'Unveiling the dust properties of z>8 galaxies. Determining when the first galaxies emerged from darkness in the early Universe is one of the outstanding quests of cosmology. However, until the launch of JWST, it is not possible to directly observe sources beyond a redshift z~11. A possible indirect method to determine the extent of star-formation prior to this observational horizon is to measure the dust content of the most distant known sources. Since dust at early times reflects the nucleosynthetic product of massive stars which exploded as Type SNe, it provides a valuable estimate of the star formation prior to the epoch of observation. Unfortunately, the inferred dust mass depends strongly on the dust temperature, a property poorly constrained or not at all at z>6. We propose to obtain deep ALMA band 8 observations for two well-studied spectroscopically-confirmed z~8.3 galaxies with a single-band dust detection, in order to determine more reliable dust temperatures and hence better estimates of star formation history at yet earlier times.',\n"," 'High-mass star formation told by water masers: disk-winds or YSO multiplicity ?. The processes leading to the formation of high-mass stars are still largely unknown. Although, as predicted by star formation models and supported by ALMA observations, accretion disks and jets should play a fundamental role, it is still to clarify the physical connection betweem mass accretion and ejection. Moreover, the very high (> 80%) binary fraction of OB stars requires a high level of mass fragmentation, which might occur either at large scales in the turbulent collapsing cores or at small scales in the massive protostellar disks. In our targets, the high-mass YSOs G011.92-0.61 and G035.02+0.35, previous VLBI masers and ALMA thermal observations strongly suggest the presence of either 1)a disk-wind, or 2)a binary system of high-mass YSOs separated by ~500au. The proposed ALMA observations aim, for the first time, to either 1)resolve the launching region of jets in high-mass YSOs (and test the disk-wind models), or 2)detect disk fragmentation on scales of 100au (and verify that it is a viable route for high-mass YSO multiplicity). In either scenarios, the results will provide a critical test bed for current models of high-mass star formation.',\n"," 'The ISM properties and systemic redshift of a unique double-peaked Lya emitter in the epoch of re-ionisation. Luminous Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) are an exciting class of objects in the early Universe (z>6) that probe of the end of the re-ionisation era. One of the most spectacular of those sources is COLA1 at z=6.59, the only double peaked Lyman-alpha emission line known. We have proposed three explanations for the puzzling double peak: 1) COLA1 resides in a large (>2 cMpc) ionised bubble that allows the blue line to redshift out of the resonance wavelength before encountering significant neutral hydrogen; 2) both peaks are red peaks from a merger along the line of sight; 3) the peaks originate from an absorption feature on top of a single broad outflowing peak. Model 1 is particularly interesting as a potential new probe of the process of re-ionisation. We propose to target COLA1 with ALMA to reliably distinguish between the currently open scenarios by determining the systemic redshift with [CII]158um. We will also constrain the obscured SFR using the IR continuum and estimate the gas-metallicity using the [CII]-UV ratio. This will allow us to map out the ISM properties of a unique galaxy that is both a tracer and an agent of re-ionisation.',\n"," 'The Most Sensitive Search for Magnetic Fields in a Solar Nebula Analogue. The search for magnetic fields threading protoplanetary disks has been a key science driver for ALMA, owing to the critical importance magnetic fields play in the evolution of protoplanetary disks. The use of continuum polarization has, however, proven to be limited owning to a multitude of polarization mechanisms unrelated to magnetic fields identified as the likely cause of the observed polarization. Molecular line polarization appears to be more uniquely related to magnetic fields, but several challenges in detecting them (beam dilution and cancellation from optically thin emission tracing opposite sides of the disk) suggest that the upper limits placed on the strength of the magnetic field could be underestimate by at least a factor of 10. We propose here a novel method to bypass these issues and instead detect a magnetic field in TW Hya purely by the broadening of emission lines due to Zeeman splitting. This is unaffected by the aforementioned issues and will allow us to detect a 10 mG field out to 150au in TW Hya at a 3 sigma significance. In addition to placing unique constraints on magnetic fields, this allows us to calibrate the non-detections found in the literature.',\n"," 'Revealing the Evolutionary Status of Candidate First Cores. In the low-mass star formation process, the first hydrostatic core is a short-lived object in hydrostatic equilibrium between thermal and gravitational pressure. It forms out of a dense molecular cloud core when the initial collapse transitions from isothermal to adiabatic. This phase lasts until the temperature rises to 2000 K and molecular hydrogen dissociates. First cores were predicted theoretically over 40 years ago but have not yet been conclusively identified by observations. Recently, several promising candidates have been suggested, but none are well-characterized enough to reveal their true evolutionary status. We propose to obtain ALMA band 3 observations of a suite of dense gas tracers toward all 5 recently identified first core candidates in order to study their physical properties, density structure, kinematics, and chemical structure, and ultimately to reveal the true evolutionary status of these intriguing new objects.',\n"," 'From Beginning to End -- Star Formation and Molecular Cloud Evolution in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We propose 12CO, 13CO, and C18O (2-1) Band 6 observations of two molecular clouds in the SW Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) to explore how the properties of molecular gas change as a cloud evolves and forms stars. By directly observing low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars via Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we can trace the history of star formation in these clouds over the last ~20 Myr. ALMA molecular gas maps at 1\" (0.3 pc) angular resolution will reveal the detailed distribution of gas with respect to the stars, and allow us to investigate the physical state of the gas before and after the onset of star formation. We target two clouds at opposite extremes of cloud evolution (judged from the ratio of PMS stars to CO emission from existing APEX measurements): pre-star formation conditions in the B1-2-E cloud, and on-going massive star formation in the SWBar Filament. The combination of ALMA and HST observations let us trace the full life cycle of SF, from natal molecular gas to newly formed stars, allowing us to simultaneously characterize cloud star formation histories, gas conditions, and the sources and effects of stellar feedback.',\n"," 'Dense molecular gas as a test for the mode of star formation in galaxies at z=2-3. There is mounting evidence for a more efficient mode of star formation in galaxies at z~2 compared to the present day, based on the higher star formation rate (SFR) for a given molecular gas mass probed by CO and dust. Here, we seek to verify this result by obtaining the first dense gas observations with HCN in six z=2-3 star-forming galaxies (SFGs). HCN traces high density gas, directly probing the star-forming gas within giant molecular clouds. Gravitational lensing offers us the unique opportunity to detect HCN in z~2 galaxies with normal SFR, as HCN is otherwise too faint and unfeasible to detect in these galaxies even with the sensitivity of ALMA. Combined with the rich ancillary data of the targets, we will (1) test whether the L_HCN-L_IR linear relation holds at z~2; (2) measure the dense gas fraction (L_HCN/L_CO(1-0)) in z~2 galaxies. The proposed observations will directly constrain how the mode of star formation varies with cosmic time and stellar mass: do z~2 galaxies behave like local starbursts or spirals, in terms of SFE and dense gas fractions? Do galaxies share the same SF physics at different z?',\n"," 'A Full Inventory of the Molecular ISM in Two Starburst Galaxies at z=5.7. We propose a full molecular line inventory in Bands 3 and 4 of the two highest known redshift dusty starburst galaxies accessible by ALMA, at z=5.7, close to the end of cosmic reionization. A carefully-constructed tuning setup targets more than 40 lines of 13 molecular species expected to be detectable in these objects, tracing the full range of excitation conditions, heating mechanisms, outflow and dynamical signatures, and chemical enrichment pathways. At these rest frequencies, our observations will match and even exceed the sensitivity of local starbursts observed by Herschel/SPIRE. By exploiting high-resolution ALMA 870um continuum observations, low- and mid-J CO observations with ATCA and ALMA, [CII] emission from APEX, and full optical-to-radio SED coverage, these observations will stand as the definitive view of the ISM conditions in these objects, serving as an effective comparative study to local starbursts (e.g. Arp220) and intermediate-redshift analog systems (e.g. the Eyelash). In one target, we aim to spatially resolve the molecular line emission, allowing a 1 kpc-scale study of the near-Eddington-limited star formation underway in this object.',\n"," 'The role of OH outflows in the high redshift Universe. Why were ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z>1 such a major contributor to the star formation density at that epoch, yet they contribute less than a percent today? A likely driver may be changes in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. Herschel observations of hydroxyl (OH) have proven extremely efficient in characterising AGN-driven outflows in the local Universe, and showing that they are relatively common. These outflows provide the only direct evidence that fuel for star formation is being removed. What are the properties of these outflows in the early universe? Are they powered by the same mechanism? We propose a novel study of AGN-driven outflows in 3 ULIRGs at redshifts 2.6-4.2, with the best available outflow diagnostic, OH, and the best available sample of gravitationally lensed sub-mm galaxies with good lens models, using the flux amplification to maximise ALMAs sensitivity to this key diagnostic. Our program will be the first detailed study of OH properties in ULIRGs in the high-redshift Universe.',\n"," 'Constraining the Vertical and Radial Structure of the Turbulence around DM Tau. Turbulence is a fundamental parameter in models of grain growth and planetary evolution and while observational constraints are challenging, our initial studies of the disks around TW Hya and HD 163296 have demonstrated the ability of ALMA to tightly constrain turbulence. Recently, using CO(2-1) data from our ALMA cycle 4 program, we have found significant non-zero turbulence in the disk around DM Tau. This is the first detection of turbulence within our sample, but our knowledge of its radial and vertical structure is limited by the fact that CO(2-1) is most sensitive to gas in the upper layers of the outer disk. We propose to build on our turbulence detection with observations of N2H+(3-2) (sensitive to cold gas near the midplane where CO is frozen out) and CO(6-5) (sensitive to warm gas higher in the disk and closer to the star than CO(2-1)). This combination of emission lines will provide an empirical measure of the vertical and radial structure of turbulence, as well as a more complete understanding of the physical source of the turbulence, the role of turbulence in planet formation, and the outward transport of angular momentum.',\n"," 'Opening a new path in the uncharted territory of high-redshift clumpy galaxies. At redshift z~1-4 giant star-forming regions (clumps) are a common feature of star-forming galaxies. However, the properties (e.g. star formation rate, mass, dust extinction) of those clumps are still unclear. We propose to observe with spatial resolution 0.2\" the dust continuum at rest-frame 150 micron of a lensed clumpy galaxy at z = 3.4. A set of ancillary data taken with comparable resolution (rest-frame UV imaging, Hb, [OIII] and Lya spatially-resolved emission line maps) is already at our disposal. With the proposed observations we aim at investigating the dust morphology of our target, comparing it with the UV and optical imaging and spectroscopic data. An inhomogeneous distribution of the dust might suggest that the detected clumps are not physical structures, but the result of the dust inhomogeneities. If instead the dust is homogeneously distributed it will be possible to estimate the dust extinction affecting the clumps. We can also unveil obscured clumps that would not be visible in HST images. We will also detect the [CII] emission with S/N>10, study its distribution across the galaxy, and compare it with the broad and offset Lya emission that we detect from MUSE data.',\n"," 'Tracing the role of AGB stars in the Galactic Fluorine budget. The cosmic origin of Fluorine (F) is still uncertain. AGB stars are one of the main candidates of F synthesis sites in our Galaxy. They are the only candidates with confirmed observational proof of F production so far, but the question is still open as to what extent AGB stars contribute to the solar-system and Galactic F content. Estimation of the total F budget in AGB stars is needed to quantify their role in the total galactic F budget. In this proposal, we request ALMA-ACA observations of AlF line emission towards three AGB stars which are expected to be efficient in F synthesis from stellar yield models. AlF is one of the two most abundant F-bearing molecule in the outflow around AGB stars. Therefore, measuring overabundance in AlF compared to solar value can potentially quntify the contribution of AGB stars in the F synthesis.',\n"," 'A Systematic ALMA Survey of the Most Massive Starless Clumps within 5kpc. By combining observations and catalogs from recent Galactic plane mid-infrared, far-infrared, (sub)millimeter, radio, and maser surveys, we have identified over 2500 massive starless clump candidates that lack evidence of current star formation in the 15 < l < 55 range of the first quadrant. This population of clumps represents the future sites of intermediate and high-mass star formation in the Galaxy and are excellent targets to obtain observational constraints on the initial conditions for clump fragmentation and intermediate/high-mass star formation. We propose to observe a sample of 12 of the most massive starless clump candidates (M ~ 500 - 4000 Msun) within 5kpc with ALMA at 1.3mm to study the physical and kinematical properties of individual starless cores. This survey will systematically characterize the core mass function and fragmentation down to 0.5 solar masses and 0.03pc scales while simultaneously constraining the virial parameter and kinematic structure of these regions. Deuterated species within the bandpass shall identify cores that are very cold and dense and that may be on the cusp of star formation.',\n"," 'Cold gas in AGNs hosts: walking along the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies.. Probing the properties of the molecular gas reservoir is a key ingredient of galaxy evolutionary studies: it is out of this gas that ultimately stars are formed. An open question is what is the role of black holes in the evolution of the gas content of their hosts. Previous CO studies of AGNs have been focused on bright quasars, whose hosts are well above the main-sequence. But most of z>1 AGNs and star-forming galaxies are actually located in this main-sequence. The main goal of this proposal is to use ALMA to address the scientic question: does the presence of an active SMBH affect the cold gas content of main-sequence galaxies at z~1.5?. We propose to measure the CO(2-1) in a representative sample of main-sequence z~1.5 AGNs. The measure will allow us to: a) Compare the star-formation efficiency of main-sequence galaxies hosting AGNs with that of inactive galaxies and verify if AGN feedback is modifying the star-formation process in its host (e.g. positive feedback). b) Compare the gas fraction of these active galaxies with that measured for inactive galaxies and test if the molecular gas content in SMBHs hosts has changed due to AGN feedback.',\n"," 'Direct imaging of an accretion disk arounf the youngest O star precursor. The immediate vicinity of the youngest high-mass protostars is a highly unexplored territory. In our Cycle 2 project, SPARKS, we discovered the youngest high-mass protostars with envelope masses up to 130 Msol. They are prior to the onset of strong ionising radiation. A detailed case study of one of our targets at 0.2\" resolution reveals the structure of the inner envelope in an unprecedented detail. We find a compact dust continuum source of 250 au likely corresponding to an accretion disk consistent with the velocity pattern of a first vibrationally excited state HC3N line. Here we aim to use sensitive, high angular resolution observations in band 3 and band 7 to image and resolve the structure of the disk in continuum. The band 3 observations are essential because the dust is expected to be optically thin. On the other hand, band 7 provides the best candidate tracer for the gas component of the disk, which is essential to provide an independent evidence for the accretion disk revealing gas in Keplerian motion. This project would directly prove the presence of an accretion disk around the youngest high-mass protostar, and thereby strongly constrain collapse models.',\n"," 'The formation of interstellar formamide. Many of the organic molecules detected in interstellar molecular clouds are also found in comets. These molecules could have played an important role in the pre-biotic chemistry of an early Earth which was subjected to cometary bombardment. There is disagreement between astrochemists about whether formamide (NH2CHO) is formed predominantly from HNCO hydrogenation in ices or from H2CO in the warm gas. There has been evidence published favoring both in observations and laboratory work. As a molecular species, formamide is of astrobiological importance because it contains a peptide bond and could be the predecessor to amino acids. This ubiquitous species has been detected in the interstellar medium, star-forming regions, and solar system bodies (comets, moons) indicating that it can survive the process of planetary system formation. Investigating formamide and two other pre-biotic species, methyl isocyanate (CH3NCO) and acetamide (NH2COCH3), will grant insight into species that may have been the spark for biotic molecules delivered to Earth. We propose these ALMA observations of high- and low-mass star-forming regions to investigate the origin of these species.',\n"," 'Tracking the Origin of Dust and Molecular Gas in an Extreme Feedback-Induced BCG Starburst. We propose to acquire spatially resolved imaging with ALMA of the dust and molecular gas in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) of the galaxy cluster MACS1931.8-2635, observing CO(1-0) to a depth of 0.18 mJy in band 3 and the dust continuum to 0.08 mJy in band 8. These ALMA observations will, for the first time, map the cold gas and dust at 0.6\" (3 kpc) scales, comparable to the size scales of the UV-bright star forming knots and dust lane width in this system. We will also measure the velocity structure of the CO(1-0) tracer at 40 km/s resolution. With these data, we will determine the sources, and distribution mechanisms, of dust in cooled gas in this BCG, characterize the nature of molecular gas flows detected in this system, and constrain the role of dust as a catalyst for star formation and intra-cluster medium cooling. By combining these unique ALMA observations with deep observations from HST, Spitzer, Herschel, Chandra, and archival MUSE IFU data, we will complete a comprehensive study of the multi-phase medium in MACS1931 that will answer unsolved questions about the origin of dust in cool core BCGs and the role of gas physics in AGN-regulated feedback and star formation.',\n"," 'Stellar feedback and physical conditions of molecular gas around low-metallicity super-star clusters. Feedback from accreting black holes and from massive stars and supernovae has become a cornerstone for our understanding of galaxy evolution. However, there are currently few observational constraints for stellar feedback, especially for the effect of metal-poor young, massive, super-star clusters (SSCs). In order to quantify physical conditions in the molecular gas around SSCs, we propose 12CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1), 12CO(3-2), 12CO(4-3), and [CI](1-0) maps at 40 pc resolution of a low-metallicity dwarf starburst, NGC 1140 (0.3 Zsun), hosting 6-7 SSCs; these transitions have already been detected with single-dish measurements. Our proposed observations will characterize the molecular gas morphology, kinematics, gas temperature, H2 density, and atomic carbon abundance in the metal-poor interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding the SSCs. We will compare our results with recent models of ISM chemistry and star formation, to better quantify the effects of stellar feedback for input to galaxy evolution models. ALMA will provide an observational perspective on the effects of stellar feedback in an extreme environment which may be representative of the ISM in high-redshift galaxy populations.',\n"," 'Resolving HCO+ in the ejecta of Supernova 1987A: effect of mixing. From our ALMA Cycle-2 and Cycle-3 spectral line scan program, we discovered HCO+ in the ejecta of supernova (SN) 1987A. The estimated HCO+ mass was about 12 orders of magnitude larger than predicted by chemical models. In order to determine where and how HCO+ was formed, we propose a high-angular resolution imaging of HCO+. The classical image of the stellar interior of the progenitor star is onion-layers of different nuclear burning zones. If a SN sustained this geometrical structure after the explosion, little HCO+ can form --- H atoms are in the H-envelope, while most C and O atoms are located in the He envelope and C + O nuclear burning zones. The likely way to form HCO+ is that microscopic and macroscopic mixings stirred elements from different nuclear burning zones immediately after the SN explosion. We expect that HCO+ will be found in clumps formed by macroscopic mixing, and that microscopic mixing diffused elements from different nuclear burning zones. HCO+ clumps should be located at more extended than CO and SiO, but more compact than Halpha. The distribution of HCO+ can provide important insight into the hydrodynamics and chemical processes of the supernova explosion.',\n"," 'Quantifying Penumbral Jet/Microjet Dynamics in the Low Solar Atmosphere. We propose to investigate penumbral jets and microjets, which are small-scale energy release events that occur in the solar chromosphere near sunspots. Such events are implicated in heating the solar atmosphere, and the basic processes are thought to be similar to larger jets and solar flares powered by magnetic reconnection. However, the exact nature of the energy release processes remains poorly understood. Recent progress in high resolution optical and infrared imaging observations have greatly advanced our knowledge on these events. However, interpretation of such observations is often complicated by the complex ionization and radiative transfer processes responsible for the observed line and/or continuum intensity. ALMA mm observations, regarded as a linear thermometer thanks to the Rayleigh-Jeans Law, provide an excellent means of constraining the detailed dynamic thermal structure in the energy release site with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The largely predictable locations and frequent occurrence of such jets make them a practical choice regarding the restricted field of view of ALMA and the declining solar activity level.',\n"," 'Does Polarization from Scattering Contaminate Magnetic Field Observations in Star Forming Regions?. Polarized emission from aligned dust grains have been used to successfully probe the structure of the magnetic field in regions of star formation. This technique was used to conduct polarization observations towards IRAS 16293B which is a young stellar object with an almost face on geometry. The SMA observations showed that the magnetic field had a toroidal or azimuthal ring like structure and were the basis of our ALMA Cycle 2 proposal. The delivered data tell a different story. The observed polarization is more consistent with that produced by scattering from grains about 200 micron in size. However, in order to confirm this, we need observations at a different wavelength. To this end, we are proposing Band 3 observations in Cycle 4 of this same object and with the same resolution of $\\\\sim0\\\\farcs2$. At these longer wavelengths, we would expect less contribution from scattering and that the polarization produced will be dominated by emission from magnetically aligned dust grains. If on the other hand, scattering continues to be the dominant mechanism even at these longer wavelengths, then even larger grains of sizes of upto 500$\\\\mu$m are present.',\n"," 'Millimeter and Submillimeter Polarization of Disks: Direct Emission or Scattered Light?. HL Tau is the only known T Tauri Star to have a resolved polarization detection in the disk. Since grains align with the magnetic field, polarization from dust emission is typically thought to trace the magnetic fields. However, in the last year four theoretical papers have suggested that polarization at (sub)millimeter wavelengths may be due to Rayleigh scattering off grains in a disk. Currently, we are unable to determine if polarization from disks is from scattering, grain alignment, or a combination of the two. ALMA has observed many 10s of hours of polarimetric observations toward disks already, but none of these observations can truly distinguish between different polarization mechanisms, making it very difficult to interpret any of these observations. We propose to observe polarization in the disk of HL Tau. With deep, high-resolution, and multi-wavelength polarization observations, we will be able to take into account morphological, wavelength-dependent, and optical depth effects, and we will accurately determine whether polarization from disks comes from scattering, grain alignment, or a combination of the two.',\n"," 'Anomalously faint [CII]from a merger at z=7.60. We have recently shown A1689-zD1, a star-forming galaxy lensed by the foreground cluster Abell 1689, to be the most distant dust-emitter known using Cycle 0 and 1 ALMA imaging. We determined its redshift to be z = 7.5 from very deep near-infrared continuum spectroscopy of the Lyman break. The source is faint compared to other dust emitters so far found at high redshift, being a magnitude fainter than L at this redshift. Our Cycle 2 observation of the source with ALMA to characterise the dust mass and infrared star-formation rate and detect the [CII]158m line, has resolved the galaxy into two components and shown that the line is an order of magnitude fainter than expected for such a galaxy. We request here higher resolution and deeper observations to confirm the emission line, determine the velocities of the two components and resolve the dust emission of this UV bright dwarf galaxy to a level of detail comparable to the HST imaging.',\n"," 'A second epoch of Serpens Souths most spectacular outflow. We have discovered and reported on a protostar driving a distinctly episodic outflow, which provides an observational signpost of episodic accretion. This source, named CARMA-7, is part of Serpens South that was mapped with ALMA in Cycle 2 at 1 arcsec resolution, and then we targeted this source in Cycle 5 with 0.14 arcsec resolution, equivalent to 60 au. At such high angular resolution, C7 reveals arguably the most complex structure in position-velocity space of any outflow observed at mm-wavelengths, as well as a chemically rich core, suggesting that it is actively accreting. We propose to use its apparent protostellar outflow variability as a proxy for accretion events. In order to better constrain its outflow characteristics, we need to know (1) proper motions and inclination angle; and (2) temperature structure along the jet. With this information, we will compile a mass-loss history for this young source, and investigate the link to accretion history.',\n"," 'Determining the primary nitrogen reservoir by ammonia ice deuteration. Nitrogen is one of the third most abundant heavy elements in the ISM. Observationally determining the primary nitrogen reservoir in the ISM is essential to understanding nitrogen chemistry. However, as the direct observations of N and N2 are challenging, the primary nitrogen reservoirs are not yet constrained. Based on the previous astrochemical modeling study, we propose to constrain the primary nitrogen reservoir in the ISM by observing multiply-deuterated ammonia gas in the warm inner regions of protostellar envelopes where ammonia ices have freshly sublimated. The proposed observations will distinguish whether the molecular forms (N2 or NH3) or atomic nitrogen are the primary reservoirs in the ISM. The result will provide fundamental insight into the nitrogen chemistry in the ISM and the interpretation of how nitrogen will be incorporated into planet-forming disks and eventually planetary bodies.',\n"," 'Millimeter photometry of the disks around Herbig AeBe stars. This is a simple, small survey program to obtain millimeter continuum and CO line fluxes for a well defined sample of disks around 51 nearby Herbig AeBe stars that have not yet been observed by ALMA. This short survey will reveal which disks are bright enough in the continuum and/or line for followup by the community and provide a near complete census (87 out of 91) of all known Herbig AeBe stars within 500 pc of the Sun. To encourage its broad and immediate utility, the data proprietary period will be waived and the flux measurements will be published within 6 months after data delivery.',\n"," 'Investigation of the molecular environment that caused fewer high-mass stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The physical processes that dictate the fragmentation of a giant molecular cloud (GMC) determine the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Numerical simulations show that a low-metallicity (Z) enviroment is expected to have inefficient cooling gas that forms fewer low-mass stars and flattens the IMF. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with low Z<~0.2 Zsun exhibits a dearth of very high-mass stars from a full GAIA census of the whole galaxy, invoking the explanation of a steep IMF. The new unbiased APEX CO(3-2) survey of the SMC, however, shows a flat cloud mass function similar to galaxies forming massive stars and clusters. Though the limited resolution (6 pc) and the unknown excitation conditions of CO(3-2) measurements prevent further investigation on differences among simulations and observed stars and gas. We request ACA observations on a large cluster of CO clouds in the center of the SMC Bar in Band 3+6 in multiple transitions with the aim to infer physical conditions precisely and to achieve a resolution down to clump scales (2 pc) where star formation actually happens. The results would have profound implications in star formation studies of the low Z early universe.',\n"," 'Testing protostellar dust polarization properties in different local conditions. Polarized dust emission is routinely used as a good tracer of magnetic field lines in star-forming cores. We have developed a chain of ALMA synthetic observations of polarization from non-ideal MHD simulations of protostellar collapse, including both the dust properties and dust alignment physics such as radiative torque alignment (RAT) to interpret our ALMA dust polarization observations in the B335 protostar, and found it is very difficult to reproduce finely the dust polarization in B335 using a single dust alignment mechanism. Since these observations are routinely used to assess the role of magnetic field to shape the disk, binaries and overall star formation processes, it is crucial to now test the grain alignment mechanisms producing the polarization signal in the complex environment taht are protostellar envelopes. We propose to carry out multi frequency ALMA observations of the polarized dust emission in B335 to complement our Band 6 observations, where the local conditions are well characterized thanks to a wealth of ancillary datset.',\n"," 'Giant Molecular Cloud Survey Toward bar and arm of the nearby Galaxy M83. Molecular-rich galaxies with prominent galactic structures are the most suitable targets for the investigation of the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs, size ~50pc) which lead massive star formation. However, due to the limited mapping ability of the existing telescopes, observations toward such molecular-rich galactic disks were limited with coarse resolutions (over 200pc), up to recent. Our recent pilot studies made with GMC-scale resolutions have revealed an evolutionary sequence of GMCs and suggested one of the necessary conditions for GMCs to initiate massive star formation is the virialization of the natal GMCs on global scale, despite star formation is a sub-pc scale phenomena. However, previous studies were limited with small survey area. To robustly verify our findings and make a further constraints, we propose wide-field observations in the CO(1--0) toward the nearby barred galaxy M83 with a significantly larger area compared to the previous studies. The proximity, presence of prominent galactic structures, molecular-dominated gas disk, and accessibility from the ALMA site make this galaxy most suitable for our purpose. Combining ALMA data with our single-dish data taken with the NRO 45m telescope we will recover the total CO flux. The survey will enable to identify hundreds of GMCs from the combined ALMA+45m data. The identified GMCs will be compared with the existing multiwavelength datasets to identify associated HII regions and star clusters to robustly state their evolutionary stage. By comparing the properties of identified clouds which reside in variety of evolutionary stages and galactic environments, the conditions required for onset of massive star formation will be strictly verified and further constrained.',\n"," 'Probing the Physics Behind Enhanced Star Formation in the Early Universe. We propose a survey of [CII] 158 micron emission from eight normal star-forming galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts of z=5.8 to 7.66. This emission line provides a unique tracer of the dynamical mass in these galaxies, which can constrain the total amount of gas present. We will use these observations to answer the question of whether an increase in the typical gas mass fractions with increasing redshift is the dominant physical cause behind an observed increase in the stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio at z > 5. These observations will also have tremendous legacy value, as they will probe the evolution of the ratio between [CII] and far-infrared luminosity to the highest redshifts. Finally, by observing the luminosity of this line at such high redshifts, we will pave the way for the future use of ALMA as a redshift machine, as [CII] represents the best chance for spectroscopic redshifts in the epoch of reionization, where Lyman alpha has become difficult to observe.',\n"," 'Measuring the Star Forming Potential of the Galactic Bar Dust Lanes. The dust lane features within the Galactic Bar are thought to mediate the flow of material from the Galactic Disk towards the Galactic Center, fueling the extreme environment found within the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Therefore, the study of galaxy bars is important for our understanding of how galaxies evolve and investigating the initial conditions of the gas before it accretes into the CMZ. The midpoint of the Dust Lanes (M4.7-0.8) was recently observed using the GBT, targeting the lower transitions of non-metastable NH3 lines - a dense gas tracer. These observations revealed multiple dense substructures with the cloud - indicating the cloud could be rich with dense gas, similar to clouds in the CMZ. Here we propose to target several dense gas tracers at the midpoint of the Dust Lanes (M4.7-0.8) that are abundantly detected in the CMZ and were recently detected in the ALMA ACES program. We use a similar spectral setup as ACES to address the question: How do the physical, chemical and dynamical properties of star-forming regions in the Galactic Bar Dust Lanes differ from those in the disc and Galactic center?',\n"," 'Isotope ratios as a probe of starburst ages and the stellar IMF? A critical observational test in the Antennae galaxies. It has been proposed that observed 18O/13C isotope ratios prove a top-heavy stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) in starburst galaxies. This diagnostic has been used to argue for a top-heavy IMF in high-z starbursts. However, independent confirmation of this model in local galaxies is so far lacking. Here we propose a critical test of this diagnostic in the overlap region of the Antennae galaxies. This region contains a large number of well characterized young star clusters with a range in masses, ages and SFRs, and simple star formation histories. Isotope ratios derived from 1-0 lines of 12CO, 13CO and C18O will provide direct critical tests of the model. Both a confirmation and a rejection of the model will constitute an important result. At a resolution of 0.5\"=50pc we will also study in unprecedented detail the molecular cloud population in the Antennae, including surface density, local free fall time and virial equilibrium in relation to the population of young clusters, and the star formation properties from MUSE data at the same resolution. In free subbands we will obtain high-quality images of the density-tracing CS(2-1) line, and of the continuum at 110 GHz.',\n"," 'Water released in a protostellar accretion burst. Low-mass protostars have been suggested to show highly variable accretion rates throughout their evolution. Such changes in accretion, and related heating of their ambient envelopes, may trigger significant chemical spatial and source-to-source variations. In ALMA Cycle 0 observations of the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 15398-3359, we detected a depression in the emission of H13CO+ in the inner 150-200 AU of the central protostellar core. This likely reflects that HCO+ is destroyed by reactions with extended water vapor present in parts of the core where the temperature is as low as 30 K, well below the freeze-out value. A possible explanation for this extended destruction by water is that the water vapor has been released due to an accretion burst during the last 100-1000 years, which increased the luminosity of IRAS 15398-3359 by a factor 100 above its current luminosity and thus caused the water ice mantles on large scales to evaporate. We here propose to image the emission from two water isotopologues in band-8 to confirm this picture and to reveal the gas dynamics affected by this recent burst and its relation to the newly-formed disk.',\n"," 'Direct sublimation vs. gas-phase synthesis: the missing link in mm/sub-mm cometary science. Comets contain ice, dust and debris left over from the formation of the Solar System. Having remained in a relatively quiescent state ever since, their compositions provide unique insights into the thermal and chemical properties of the protosolar disk and prior interstellar cloud. Detections of complex organic molecules in cometary comae are becoming routine using single-dish mm-wave observations, but the common assumption that these species originate in the cometary ice is largely untested. Our latest chemical/hydrodynamic coma models point to gas-phase chemistry as a possible origin for some of these species. We propose to use ALMA to map the distributions of HC3N, NH2CHO, CH3CN and other molecules (including known extended source species) in a bright target-of-opportunity comet, to reveal whether these species arise directly from the sublimation of cometary ice or whether they are instead synthesized as products of gas-phase chemistry in the coma. In case of only a faint comet in Cycle 5, we will focus on mapping the distributions of H2CO, HNC (and other abundant species) to elucidate the nature of their extended coma sources and compare to previous (limited) mapping results.',\n"," 'Physical Properties of Galaxies that Ionize the Universe. Measuring the properties of low-luminosity galaxies near redshift 6 is central to understanding the reionization of the universe. Although hundreds of bright galaxies have now been identified at this era, their number density is too low to even maintain the ionization of the intergalactic gas, and lower luminosity galaxies detectable only via their line emission provide the closest relation between any post-reionization galaxy population and the objects that actually reionized the universe. Prior to ALMA, however, our knowledge of these important galaxies was limited to number counts and luminosity functions of hydrogen Lyman-alpha emission. The luminosity and line profile of this resonance line depend sensitively on the gas kinematics and dust content of the host galaxy, so Lyman-alpha observations alone provide little physical information about the galaxy properties. To establish the typical star formation rate, dynamical mass, and systemic velocity for the lowest luminosity galaxies yet detected at this important era, we request ALMA observations of their [CII] 158um fine structure emission.',\n"," 'Signpost of Effective Magnetic Field: Probing Drift Velocity. We propose H13CO+ (3-2) observations toward the two Class 0 protostars B335 and L1527 to probe drift velocities in their protostellar envelopes. We have been studying their gas motions from thousands of AU to inner 100 AU in neutral molecular lines, such as C18O. We find that the rotation in L1527 can be explained with the conventional model without incorporating magnetic field, while that in B335 can be better explained with our non-ideal MHD models with strong magnetic braking. Therefore, these two protostars represent the two extreme cases of weak and strong magnetic field. With the proposed observations, we will measure the rotational velocities of ions traced by H13CO+ on hundreds of AU scale, and compare with those of neutrals traced by our previous ALMA C18O observations. Our model calculations suggest that in L1527, there is no difference between ion and neutral velocities because of its weak magnetic field. In contrast, in B335, we expect the ion rotation is decelerated to subsonic and cannot be detected because of the strong magnetic braking. These two distinct features in drift velocity can be a signpost of dynamically ineffective and effective magnetic field.',\n"," 'Gas and Ice: Inheritance or Reset in Taurus planet forming disks?. The abundance and distribution of volatiles in protoplanetary disks is crucial to our understanding of the formation of planets and their habitability. Yet, we still do not known how much of the infalling icy material from the natal cloud makes it unscathed into the shielded disk midplane, and how much of it is reset to its atomic constituents in the gas phase. The gaseous C/H abundance in disks has previously been shown to probe the amount of ices available in the midplane. The recent discovery of Class II sources with late infall facilitates the study of the role of infall on the gaseous and icy chemical inventory in protoplanetary disks. We propose to observe the gaseous carbon abundance tracer [CI] at 492.161 GHz and the C/O ratio tracer CCH in Band 6 in a sample of thirteen protoplanetary disk in the Taurus star forming region, limiting any biases of different starting conditions. Six of these sources have clear signs of infall. By comparing sources with and without infall, at different stages of their evolution, we will trace the level of molecular reset upon infall and the effect that reset has on the amount of ices that are frozen out in disks as a function of time.',\n"," 'Probing the velocity structure of the NGC 6334 filament. Herschel observations of nearby clouds support a paradigm for low-mass star formation in which filaments play a central role. First, the dissipation of kinetic energy in large-scale MHD flows generates ~ 0.1 pc-wide filaments in the ISM. Second, the densest filaments fragment into prestellar cores above the line mass threshold for gravitational instability. Two major open problems are 1) to understand how dense star-forming (SF) filaments can maintain a roughly constant inner width ~ 0.1 pc while evolving, and 2) to determine if the same picture applies to more distant clouds forming high-mass stars. Single-dish mm line observations and modelling of nearby filaments suggest that the solution to the first problem is ``accretion-driven internal turbulence, which generates a complex braid-like density/velocity structure in the filaments. Here, we propose to test this scenario for a more massive filament in the high-mass SF cloud NGC6334, by mosaicing the filament in the N2H+(1-0) line and 3.2 mm continuum. The results will be compared with MHD simulations of accreting/collapsing filaments and are expected to give key insight into the dynamical evolution of massive SF filaments.',\n"," 'Effects of active galactic nucleus and starburst in the nearby galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 253: High resolution images of CN, SO, and HC3N at the 100 GHz region. We propose to obtain high resolution (~0\".75) images of CN, SO, and HC3N at the 100 GHz region (band 3) toward nearby galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 253. So far more than 40 molecular species have been found in external galaxies. The study of their abundances and the understanding of physical and chemical processes are a fundamental for astrophysics and astrochemistry of galaxies. One of the interesting topics is the effect of X-ray produced by AGN (active galactic nucleus) to molecular abundances. We carried out molecular line survey observations toward the nearby galaxy NGC 1068 with AGN and the prototypical starburst galaxies NGC 253 and IC 342 with the Nobeyama 45m radio telescope to study molecular abundances and to prepare for ALMA proposals. Our ALMA cycle 0 proposal was accepted, and we already received a part of data (2011.0.00061.S, PI S. Takano). Images obtained at the band 3 toward NGC 1068 (beam size of about 4”.3 x 2”.4), covering the central nuclear region and the surrounding starburst ring, demonstrated clear distributions of molecules in one or both of these extreme regions. These images are excellent for the study of physical and chemical processes. Based on these results, following observations are mainly proposed. (1) We continue to obtain the above clear images of other molecules at the band 3. CN (N=1-0) is selected as one of the key molecules to study the effect of X-ray. (2) Simultaneously high resolution (~0\".75) images are necessary to compare with results of model calculations at the < 100 pc scale. In addition to CN (N=1-0), we selected related interesting molecules HC3N (J=11-10) and SO (J,N=3,2-2,1) for the ALMA cycle1 observations.',\n"," 'The nature and origin of the Solar system scale disk in the Helix Nebula. We aim at imaging the Solar system scale, dusty disk around the central star of the Helix nebula, the closest planetary nebula (PN, d=152 to 219pc). There are two scenarios for its origin: a Kuiper belt that survived the stellar post-main sequence (post-MS) evolution or a remnant post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (pAGB) disk that formed from material ejected by the star during that phase. We will measure the gas content and probe for large grains in the disk in order to distinguish between the two scenarios. The primordial Kuiper belt case: This will be the first Kuiper belt confirmed and imaged around a star that went through the post-MS evolution and critical, direct evidence that planetary systems survive this phase. We will observationally investigate the effects of this phase on planetary/planetesimal systems. The remnant post-AGB disk case: We will measure its gas and dust mass to test predictions of evolutionary time scales of such disks. We will investigate whether second-generation planet(esimal) formation is possible there. Our observations will impact our understanding of the evolution of post-MS stars and their disks and on the binary hypothesis of PN formation.',\n"," 'CO redshifts of SPT sources. Recent ground and space-based multi wavelength (sub)millimeter surveys covering hundreds of square degrees have discovered a large number ofstrongly lensed, ultra-bright submm galaxies (SMGs). The largest of these, by nearly an order of magnitude at present, is the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, which covers 2500 square degrees. Its 1.4mm detection wavelength ensures a uniform source selection function across z=1-8. Both aspects make SPT the ideal survey to uncover substantial numbers of the elusive z>4 SMG population. We have been granted ALMA observing time in cycle 0 to perform unbiased redshift measurements in the 3mm band in 26 SPT source. This survey is a large success and yields 45 detected line features, 16 (>60%) redshifts at z>3 and two sources at z=5.7 which places them among the most distant SMGs known today. The resulting redshift distribution is almost flat between z=2.5-4.5, in contrast to experiments based on radio identified SMGs in the past with far reaching consequences for the obscured star formation rate density at high redshift. Here we ask to extend our extremely successful efforts to obtain molecular line based redshifts of the SPT sources. In this proposal we focus on a particularly deep part of the SPT-survey located at 23h LST from which we have selected a complete flux limited sample of 15 SMGs with S1.4mm>16mJy within a 15x15 deg^2 field (compared to S1.4mm>25mJy over 1300deg^2 in cycle 0). The broader range of lensed fluxes gives us the ability to investigate and correct for possible redshift biases in different regimes of lens magnification. Combined with the derived magnifications from our imaging project this sample will also help to construct intrinsic flux (and therefore luminosity) limited samples and will the statistics in our SMG redshift distribution to determine its shape in the critical redshift range z=2.5-4.5 more precisely.',\n"," 'Do spiral-arm clouds fragment dynamically or gravitationally?. Most new stars in spiral galaxies form in the spiral-arms, however, the mechanisms that control star formation in these regions remain elusive. High-resolution studies of nearby galaxies imply that local processes that operate in the dense gas play a crucial role. These processes cannot be studied in external galaxies due to the lack of resolution; instead, we must gain insight by studying the analogs of spiral-arm clouds in Milky Way. Indeed, recent works have identified such analogs, but so far, their internal structure and physics are unknown. We will take a step forward by determining whether spiral-arm gas fragments gravitationally or dynamically, and at which scales these modes operate. We will determine the kinematics of a ~150 pc long section of the most prominent known spiral-arm cloud, so-called Nessie, covering three orders of magnitudes in size-scales. This will be done with ACA stand-alone observations of N2H+ and HNC emission in band 3. The observed velocity structure, gradients, and accelerations, together with our existing column density data, enable us to assess the fragmentation modes and to constrain the physical processes that control spiral-arm star formation.',\n"," 'After The Fall: An Ultra High-Resolution View of the Molecular Gas in a Post-Starburst Galaxy. Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) are an important stage in the buildup of the present-day quiescent galaxy population. Likely relics of vigorously starbursting, major gas-rich mergers, PSBs had their star formation quenched within the last ~0.1-1 Gyr. We previously discovered extremely compact, turbulent molecular reservoirs in a sample of PSBs, all exhibiting extreme star formation suppression. This observing plan targets a single, gas-rich post-starburst, aiming to resolve its CO(2-1) and 1.3mm continuum emission on ~20 pc scales. Our Cycle 6 target, unresolved at 200 pc scales, possesses a gas surface density (at least) equivalent to Arp 220, but with a 10x lower star forming efficiency --- one of the most extreme objects of its kind. ALMA provides a unique opportunity: in its extended configuration, it delivers exquisite (0.02\") spatial resolution, providing the ~20 pc physical resolution needed to fully resolve the incredibly dense molecular gas in this PSB. This is perhaps our best option to discern the mechanism which is suppressing star formation in PSBs, a result which will significantly advance our understanding of how starbursting galaxies die and fade into quiescence.',\n"," 'The hot beginning of massive halos: SZ confirmation of a z=2.5 galaxy cluster. We propose ACA 93~GHz observations of the z=2.506 galaxy cluster Cl J1001+0220 to measure the Sunyaev-Zeldovich signature of its X-ray detected intracluster medium (ICM). A dense cluster core observed right before the quenching of its galaxy population, Cl J1001 is our best candidate so far for the most distant virialized halo, observed early in its existence. This program aims at constraining the pressure profile of the ICM, at a pivotal epoch in its evolution.',\n"," 'Is the unique ultracool object closest to Earth radio-loud?. WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (W0855) is an unique object the coldest known brown dwarf (BD) with a temperature of only ~250 K, located just 2.2 pc away. It is extremely faint, even at mid-infrared (MIR) where its spectral energy distribution peaks, making it difficult to investigate if it has companions. However, some cool brown dwarfs (BDs) can have magnetic fields in excess of 1kG and they can emit related radio emission. The angular resolution in the radio regimen can be much higher than in the optical/MIR. Here we propose a pilot project to take advantage of this effect. Out first goal is to investigate the radio properties of W0855 with combined Band 3 and 7 observations. If W0855 is detectable within a reasonable time, we plan to embark (via future proposal) on a radio-astrometric monitoring campaign to search for companions/planets with much higher accuracy than the best current effort with Spitzer. Should we fail to detect radio emission from W0855, our finding will set an upper limit on the magnetic field of this extremely faint object that is beyond the reach of the modern/near-future high-res spectrographs.',\n"," 'Formation of Wide-Separation, Low-Mass Companions: the GQ Lup System. We propose to image circumstellar material in the GQ Lup system, a very young Sun-like star with a well characterized substellar (possibly planetary) mass companion in a 100 AU orbit. Such low-mass, wide-separation companions present serious challenges to standard models of both planet and binary star formation. ALMA provides the high sensitivity and resolution to detect and isolate circumstellar emission from various components in nearby systems like this and to provide new constraints on formation mechanisms. In particular, millimeter imaging can constrain (1) the presence of a remnant outer disk that could point to \"planet-like\" formation of the companion within a large disk around the primary, (2) the presence and mass of a \"circumplanetary\" disk around the companion that would be difficult to reconcile with scenarios where the companion was formed closer in and scattered or migrated outward, and (3) sculpting of the disk around the primary, such as a cavity, that could point to an additional close in object involved in a dynamical interaction that. Both detections and non-detections of these circumstellar features will address the viability of proposed formation mechanisms.',\n"," 'Witnessing Giant Planet Formation in the Act. Observations of giant planets at large semi-major axes (up to 100 au) contrast with the traditional picture of planet formation following the core accretion method most effective in the inner 10 au of disks. Gravitational instabilities at large radii in massive disks have been suggested as a rapid alternative for forming giant planets in the outer disk. We propose to observe Gomezs Hamburger (GoHam) in CO isotopologue emission lines (12CO, 13CO 3-2) and CS 7-6 in Band 7 at 0.15\". GoHam is a massive circumstellar disk (Mdisk / Mstar ~ 0.1), which shows an overdensity (GoHam b) with a mass of 1 - 11 M_Jup. The unique edge-on viewing geometry of this system allows for a 3D reconstruction of the disk temperature and density structure using velocity information to infer line-of-sight distances. We will use this 3D reconstruction to directly compare with models of giant planet formation. In addition, the requested spatial resolution of 0.15\" will allow us to resolve GoHam b and trace the formation of a giant planet or brown dwarf companion via gravitational instability at local scales.',\n"," 'An Unbiased Survey of Disk Structures and Planet Formation around Very Low-mass Stars in Taurus. Correlations between protoplanetary disk properties and stellar mass are frequently applied to infer initial conditions and evolutionary processes of disks. High-resolution ALMA images of dust disks reveal that some disks are large and exhibit exquisite substructures, while others are small and may lack substructures. Since most of these are images of disks around 0.5-2 Msun stars, the stellar mass range is insufficient to use as a lever arm for correlations of disk morphology versus stellar mass. We request high resolution (0.04\") images of 16 low-mass (0.1-0.3 Msun) T Tauri disks, unbiased to substructures and mm-brightness, to evaluate the differences in the dust morphology in disks versus stellar mass. The ultimate goal is to understand how the differences at the disk stage relate to differences in the population of exoplanets around very low-mass and solar-mass stars. The sample is complete for disks around M3-M5 stars, with selection criteria for extinction, known binaries and declination. These observations provide an important complement to our unbiased sample of disks around solar-mass stars in Taurus as well as to high resolution results from other surveys.',\n"," 'Gas fraction and depletion time of massive main sequence galaxies at z=3-5. The evolution of the gas fraction and gas depletion time beyond redshifts of z=3 is ill-constrained and controversial for massive (log(M_star) > 10.0) normal star-forming, i.e. main sequence (MS), galaxies. This redshift range (z>3) is important as the cosmic star formation rate density increases. In Cycle 2 we detected 45/72 of such photo-z selected galaxies with an average log(M_star)=10.7 in their 240GHz continuum - our proxy for cold gas mass. These z~3.2 objects follow the expected trends in gas fraction and depletion time if a universal, log-linear SFR-gas mass relation is coupled to the observed time evolution of MS galaxies, while trends with specific SFR start to emerge. This proposal completes our Cycle 2 and ongoing Cycle 3 efforts yielding a probable sample of ~150 detections. Utilizing a new near-IR selection technique to select the most massive MS galaxies, we request 5.5 hr to obtain the gas mass for 45 galaxies at the high stellar mass end with an average log(M_star)=11.0 at z=3-5 highly complementary to the Cycle 2 objects with an average log(M_star)=10.3. These proposed observations will provide robust constraints vital for current galaxy evolution models.',\n"," 'Are disks around post-AGB binaries second generation protoplanetary disks?. ALMA revealed the detailed morphology of protoplanetary disks showing a lot of structure in the dust distribution (e.g. gaps, spirals). At the other end of the HR diagram, post-AGB binaries are also surrounded by disks of dust and gas. Those disks were formed from matter ejected in a strong binary interaction process at the end of the AGB phase. Despite a very different formation process post-AGB disks share several properties with protoplanetary disks such as similar infrared excesses, inner rim physics and dust grain growth. This raises the question of the planet formation efficiency across the HR diagram. With this proposal we aim to make a pilot observation of one of the best-studied disks around a post-AGB binary system to reveal its structure in the continuum and compare it to protoplanetary disks. Together with infrared direct imaging and interferometric observations, these ALMA observations will help us to constrain the disk structure around the prototype of post-AGB binaries at multiple wavelengths and spatial scales. In the case of the detection of asymmetric feature new light will be shed on these intriguing second-generation protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'Unveiling dusty star-forming galaxies and probing multiple AGN within a giant Lyman-alpha nebula at z=3.167. In the hierarchical model of structure formation, giant elliptical galaxies form through merging processes, within the highest density peaks known as protoclusters. Usually, radio galaxies pinpoint the location of these young protoclusters. However, as part of a campaign to map Lyman-alpha around radio-quiet quasars, we have discovered three giant (>200 kpc) nebulae that host multiple AGN and are surrounded by overdensities of Lyman-alpha emitters. These regions are prime candidates for massive protoclusters in the early stages of assembly. To search for ultraluminous starburst activity within these unique structures, we have initiated a submm programme with single-dish telescopes (e.g. APEX). Intriguingly, our first targeted large-scale structure at z=3.167 showed strong emission at 870 micron. To firmly characterize the source(s) of this emission and known companion objects, we propose here to use ALMA to conduct sensitive observations in band 4 targeting the CO(5-4) line emission and the underlying continuum. These observations will open the path to a detailed analysis and comprehension of the progenitors of elliptical galaxies.',\n"," 'Dust in the Reionisation Era: A New Probe of the Birth of Galaxies. Determining when the first galaxies emerged represents an exciting and fundamental observational quest. Assuming they initiated cosmic reionization, Planck measurements suggest this cosmic dawn occurred at redshifts z~10-12. In a pilot programme targeting a galaxy with deep HST and Spitzer imaging at a photometric redshift z=8.4±0.2, we demonstrated ALMAs unique ability to detect dust emission while simultaneously securing a spectroscopic redshift via [OIII] emission at z=8.38. The dust mass provides valuable insight into the earlier chemical enrichment history and when stellar nucleosynthesis began. We propose to target three further carefully-selected redshift z>8.5 galaxies with good HST and Spitzer photometry to produce the first meaningful census of the dust masses in very early galaxies with well-characterised stellar masses and star formation rates. This will provide the first estimate of when cosmic dawn occurred and form a natural springboard for complementary studies of early chemical evolution using JWST.',\n"," 'Volatiles in protoplanetary disks - Tracers of thermochemistry, and transport?. Here we propose to carry out a 0.4-0.5 arcsecond imaging survey of the HCN 4-3 and CO 3-2 lines in a carefully selected suite of protoplanetary disks with intense, well characterized near- through mid-infrared molecular emission from water vapor, organics, and carbon monoxide. Combined with detailed radiative transfer models, the full data sets will accurately constrain the molecular abundance gradients and volatile elemental ratios throughout the disks. The locations of the frost lines and the abundance jumps across them should provide our first detailed glimpses into the underlying transport dynamics of gas and solids, and only ALMA can provide the necessary angular resolution and sensitivity needed to connect the short- and long-wavelength probes of the gas in the inner and outer disk. Efficient correlator settings in Band 7 enable isotopologues of CO and HCN to be imaged at the same time as the parent species, along with several other important tracers of disk chemistry. This program modestly expands upon observations presently scheduled as Priority C filler in Cycle 2, and any such AOTs acquired in CY2015 will reduce the time required for this program accordingly.',\n"," 'Having a ``Rosetta Stone for galaxy formation studies in the early Universe. We propose observations of the [OIII] 88 micron emission line for an H-drop Lyman break galaxy with ALMA. The galaxy was found in the UltraVISTA near-infrared deep imaging data in the COSMOS field. We performed an H-dropout selection to find objects at z>13. After careful examination of non-detections in the deep optical to H-band images as well as a flat spectrum from K-band to Spitzer IRAC [3.6] and [4.5]-bands, only one candidate remains. The absolute magnitude of this object is as bright as -23.4 and the best photometric redshift is estimated at z=13.7. The number density of such a luminous object is actually consistent with the (no-)evolution of the bright-end in the UV luminosity function from z~10 recently reported. A successful detection of the [OIII] line from this object will yield a new redshift record. The proposed observations are required to be executed in Janurary or March to meet the JWST proposal deadline on May 1st. The earliest possible timing to observe a real z~14 galaxy with JWST must be beneficial to the broad astronomical community. This galaxy will be a ``Rosetta Stone for galaxy formation studies. #The exact object coordinate will be set in Phase 2.',\n"," 'Warm gas in the HD142527 planet-forming disk. The gas-rich disk around HD~142527 highlights a large gap, from 10 to ~140AU, suggestive of gaseous giant planet formation. We have recently imaged a substellar object inside the dust gap, orbiting at 30~AU. The radius of the gaps outer edge varies by a factor of 2, in a morphology reminiscent of eccentric orbits. Is HD~142527b responsible for clearing the gap, as expected from core-accretion? Is gas accretion still going-on? Another feature of HD~142527 is evidence for azimuthal variations in the chemical abundances. This azimuthal structure is probably linked to the same process that shaped the gap. What is the physical state and the relative distribution of the gas and dust that are affected by the gap-clearing process? HD~142527b is a chance to observe planet formation, or its most recent wake. The gas reservoir to build it, at orbits of up to 100AU, still holds 0.1~Msun and a range of neutral and molecular phases. In particular the regions abutting the gap are expected to be warm, and best separated from the colder regions in CO(6-5). Our preliminary detection with CHAMP+ ensures signal. We propose to obtain resolved observations of HD~142527 in ALMA band 6, 7 and 9 of the dust continua and CO and HCO+ ladders. This dataset will image the imprint of the companion accretion onto the gaseous bulk mass of the disk. We will produce limits on the mass of gas interior to the gap, and constrain the physical conditions that occur in planet formation.',\n"," '50-pc resolution mapping of a unique strongly lensed z=2.3 sub-mm galaxy. We propose Band 9 and Band 7 observations in compact and extended configurations of the strongly gravitationally lensed z=2.32 star-forming galaxy SMMJ2135 (The \"Cosmic Eyelash\"). The magnification of this galaxy by a foreground cluster, combined with the high resolution of extended configuration ALMA observations will allow us to probe to high resolution (0.08\") corresponding to ~50pc in the source plane of the galaxy. This will provide a factor of ~3x higher resolution than our previously obtained sub-mm maps. This physical scale is comparable to the charcteristic size of local GMCs. Complementary observations in the compact array will ensure that we recover all the flux and probe a large range of angular scales within the source. We will combine our rest-frame 140um and 260um observations with existing comparable resolution maps of CO(1-0), CO(6-5) and radio emission to measure the sub-mm morphology, the internal dust temperature structure, the star-formation efficiencies in GMCs and the spatially-resolved far-infrared - radio correlation within a high-redshift star-forming galaxy. Our science goals are: -To measure the sub-mm morphology of SMMJ2135 on 50-pc scales, determining the number, size, spatial distribution and rest-frame 140um luminosity of the star-forming regions on these scales. -Combine the 450um and 870um photometry for the star-forming regions to measure the luminosity and hence star formation rate for each clump. -Combine the star-formation rates of the clumps with estimates of their gas masses to test whether their star formation efficiencies are significantly higher than GMCs in the Milky Way. Furthermore, we will investigate the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation on 50-pc to ~kpc scales. -We will measure the spatially resolved far-infrared radio correlation. Although these results will be based on a single galaxy, SMMJ2135 is representative of the high-redshift, gas-rich, star-forming population. Moreover, these observations will provide a test of whether the scaling laws between gas and star formation developed at z=0 are applicable in the gas-rich, rapidly evolving ISM in high redshift galaxies.',\n"," 'Detailed observations of molecular cloud toward the peculiar supernova remnant W49B. We propose the detailed CO observations toward the supernova remnant (SNR) W49B. W49B has unique appearances, the \"barrel-like\" structure in the radio and infrared and the \"jet-like\" X-ray distribution possibly originated by a jet-driven supernova. Because the number of SNRs with jet-like feature is very limited, W49B is a special site for the study of environment of asymmetric jet-driven SN explosion. The molecular cloud associated with W49B has not been well determined yet. We conducted an analysis of 12CO(J=1-0, J=3-2) data of single-dish telescopes (the Nobeyama 45 m telescope and the JCMT). We found (i) the clouds corresponding to the radio and infrared filaments, (ii) the possibly shock interacting clump with a high intensity 12CO J=3-2/J=1-0 ratio, and (iii) the velocity distribution of the expanding cloud with 20 arcsec resolution. However, this resolution is not high enough to compare with the barrel and the jet-like X-ray. Using the ALMA CO(J=2-1) observations with the resolution of 5.7 arcsec (~0.2 pc), we will investigate (i) the more detailed molecular environment, (ii) the physical properties of the cloud, and (iii) the origin of the jet-like X-ray and SNR W49B.',\n"," 'The black hole - galaxy mass relationship at redshift 6. We propose to make [CII] and rest-frame 160 micron continuum observations of a sample of z=6 quasars with observed black hole mass ~10^8 solar masses. The science goal is to measure the dynamical masses of the quasar host galaxies and determine the black hole to galaxy mass ratio at this epoch. Previous work at this redshift has been based on observations of SDSS quasars with black holes > 10^9 solar masses that are subject to a selection bias. Our aims are to measure the strength of the selection bias and hence the true relationship, which is a key constraint on theories of the early co-evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. The dust continuum luminosity measures the star formation rate to be compared with the black hole accretion rate.',\n"," 'Knocking on the door of Large Lens Samples with ALMA. Gravitationally lensed sources offer a unique window onto the Universe, by amplifying the background source both in flux and in angular size, and by probing the intervening matter. This allows large samples of gravitational lenses to statistically measure the cosmological properties of the Universe, especially since lens-selection in sub-mm relies solely on the background, lensed source. Here, we aim to use ALMA to test our state-of-the-art method for finding lenses hidden inside the lower-flux regimes of sub-mm surveys. We use the near-infrared VIKING survey to look for foreground, lensing galaxies, expected to be bright in these colours. Initial analysis finds our method works robustly, however we require high-resolution imaging to confirm this. We stringently select 86 potential lenses from 20 to 80 mJy at 500 micron, and require 18.7 hours to identify their lensing nature, a method verified by our Pilot program. Not only can these measurements verify our method, they can also be a first measurement of the lensing probability at low flux densities.',\n"," 'A survey of 183 GHz water megamasers in nearby AGN. Extragalactic megamasers in AGN are remarkable tools that uniquely probe sub-pc scale geometry and kinematics of the nuclear molecular gas, provide gold-standard masses of supermassive black holes, and allow us to determine geometric distances to galaxies in the Hubble flow. The most scientifically productive megamasers for these studies are so-called disk masers, which demonstrate Keplerian rotation about the central supermassive black holes. Observational work on disk masers has so far been largely limited to studies of the 22 GHz line. With ALMA Band 5, for the first time, we have the sensitivity to probe a water maser transition at 183 GHz with a predicted intensity rivaling that of the 22 GHz transition. Here we propose an exploratory program to search for 183 GHz water masers toward a set of galaxies that are known to have 22 GHz maser disks in Keplerian rotation about the central black hole. This survey aims to establish the detection rate for 183 GHz megamasers, determine their spatial distribution within the accretion disk, and use the 183 GHz lines to probe the physical conditions in accretion disks and measure black hole masses in nearby AGN.',\n"," 'Flowing the gas from molecular clouds to protostellar envelopes. The formation and evolution of cores and envelopes (and the disks and protostars inside) depend on the density and velocity structure of their parent cloud or filament. The scales of the outer envelope/core (~10^4 AU) are particularly important as the gas properties on these scales influence the mass reservoir (and final mass) of the forming star, and the number of companions in a multiple system. We propose to conduct mosaic observations of a very young mini-cluster in a filament in Orion, representative of the way most stars form in our Galaxy. We will map the cluster using molecular lines that probe different regimes in the star formation environment in order to: 1) characterize the dynamical state and structure of the gas in a region of clustered star formation in a filament; 2) follow the kinematics and distribution of the gas from cloud to envelope scales (~0.1 pc to 1000 AU) in a cluster and study how these impact the multiplicity and disk properties of protostellar systems; 3) investigate how the feedback and gravity of a source affect nearby sources and the cluster medium; and 4) determine how these properties vary between sources at different ages within the cluster.',\n"," 'Characterizing the Brown Dwarf Orbiting Interior to the Debris Ring around HD 206893. Directly imaged companions orbiting within directly imaged debris rings provide a rare and valuable opportunity to place dynamical constraints on the mass and orbit of the companion. HD 206893 is only the second known system to host a directly imaged brown dwarf companion orbiting interior to a debris ring. The outer radius of the debris disk has been marginally resolved by Herschel, but the inner radius, eccentricity, inclination, and degree of axisymmetry of the disk are still unknown. Here we propose to spatially resolve the full debris ring to measure its properties and derive dynamical constraints on the mass and orbit of the brown dwarf companion, which will also provide insight into its formation mechaism. Since the masses of directly imaged brown dwarfs are derived from largely uncalibrated models of their photometric and spectroscopic properties, a dynamical constraint from the objects interaction with the debris ring will have significant impact on our broader understanding of brown dwarfs.',\n"," 'On the star-forming and co-evolution nature of less-biased low-luminosity quasars at z > 6. The recent discovery of high redshift low-luminosity quasars (LLQSOs) provides a less-biased picture of the early evolution of both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. We have been conducting multi-wavelength follow-up campaigns of LLQSOs at z > 6, which are several to >10 times fainter than the luminous z~6-7 quasars known to date. In ALMA Cycles 4 and 5, we found that the host galaxies of those LLQSOs have star formation rate about one order of magnitude lower than those of optically-luminous quasars. Moreover, these LLQSOs exhibit ratios of SMBH mass to galaxy mass roughly consistent with values seen at the local universe. However, these less-biased results rely solely on a small number of submm observations (in total 13 LLQSOs at the time of this submission). With this Cycle 6 program, we thus aim at detecting the [CII] line and the underlying FIR continuum emission of another 12 z > 6 quasars selected from our LLQSO catalog, to statistically test the above trend and obtain a comprehensive view of early galaxy-formation. The number of LLQSOs with ALMA measurements will finally become comparable to that of luminous quasars with resolved properties.',\n"," 'The bright, inclined disk of IM Lup: an ideal laboratory for studying dust-scattering-induced millimeter polarization. New studies have shown that millimeter-wave polarization from protoplanetary disks can be produced from scattering by dust (Kataoka et al. 2015, 2016; Yang et al. 2016a,b). However, recent observations of disk polarization -- most notably toward HL Tau (Stephens et al. 2014) and NGC 1333-IRAS 4A1 (Cox et al. 2015) -- may be contaminated by polarization from dust grain alignment. To be confident that we are observing polarization caused by dust scattering and not by emission from magnetically aligned grains, we propose Band 7 polarization observations toward the large, bright, inclined, and optically thin disk of IM Lup, a weakly accreting T Tauri star that is an ideal laboratory for testing dust-scattering theories.',\n"," 'Shut It Down: Probing Molecular Feedback in z~4.5 Dusty, Star-forming Galaxies. Above stellar masses of log(M*/Msun)~11, the abundance of galaxies drops exponentially, even out to z~4. These galaxies host little ongoing star formation, and appear to have been quickly and efficiently \"quenched,\" but the process(es) by which this quenching occurs are poorly understood. Theoretical models invoke feedback from AGN and/or star formation to disrupt, expel, or heat the gas supply and prevent further star formation. Recent observations and circumstantial evidence suggests that the bulk of star formation in the earliest quiescent galaxies took place in dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We propose to test models of feedback and the evolutionary connection between DSFGs and quiescent galaxies by spatially and spectrally resolving massive molecular outflows in six z~4.5 galaxies. Our observations will constrain the outflow geometry, mass loss rates, and feedback mechanism, allowing us to determine whether quenching is likely due to gas depletion or gas removal. These galaxies span a factor of 5x in star formation rate (SFR) and 20x in SFR surface density, giving a large dynamic range to constrain outflow scaling relations and extend local work to high-z.',\n"," 'Dense Gas in Strongly Lensed Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies. The relationship between star formation and the dense self-gravitating gas is critical for our understanding of galaxies. Yet, there are few measurements of this gas phase in high-z galaxies. We propose ALMA Band 3 & 4 observations of the J=4-3 and 5-4 lines of HCN, HNC, and HCO+ towards 10 strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) selected from the South Pole Telescope sample over the redshift range z=2-4. These lines trace dense gas associated with star-forming cores capable of surviving the extreme ISM conditions at high redshifts. The 10 sources targeted have well-constrained total gas masses, star-formation rates, and lens models. The proposal will be the first survey of dense gas in the high-z DSFG population. It will tell us if high-z DSFGs have higher dense gas fractions than local starbursts, and whether model predictions, based on local surveys, apply at high redshifts: does the dense gas star-formation efficiency depend on the dense gas fraction or is it universal? The observations will be sensitive to emission from the mid-IR-pumped vibrational HCN lines, which will gives a first constraint on the fraction of our sources that are compact obscured nuclei.',\n"," 'Deuterated Ammonia in Prestellar Cores. Stars form in molecular cloud cores, cold and dense regions enshrouded by dust. The initiation of this process is among the least understood steps of star formation. High-resolution heterodyne spectroscopy provides invaluable information about the physical conditions (density, temperature), kinematics (infall, outflows), and chemistry of these regions. Classical molecular tracers, such CO, CS, and many other abundant gas-phase species, have been shown to freeze out onto dust grain mantles in prestellar cores. However, N-bearing species, in particular ammonia, are much less affected by depletion and are observed to stay in the gas phase at densities in excess of 106 cm-3. The molecular freeze-out has important consequences for the chemistry of dense gas. In particular, the depletion of abundant gas-phase species with heavy atoms drives up abundances of deuterated H3+ isotopologues, which in turn results in spectacular deuteration levels of molecules that do remain in the gas phase. Consequently, lines of deuterated N-bearing species, in particular\\u2028the fundamental lines of ammonia isotopologues, having very high critical densities, are optimum tracers of innermost regions of dense cores. We propose to study the morphology, density structure and kinematics of a prototypical dense cloud core, by mapping the spatial distribution of ammonia isotopologues in L1689N using ALMA in its most compact configuration. These observations provide optimum probes of the onset of star formation, as well as the physical processes that control gas-grain interaction, freeze-out, mantle ejection and deuteration. The sensitive, high-resolution spectra acquired within this program will be analyzed using sophisticated radiative transfer models and compared with outputs of state-of-the-art 3D MHD simulations and chemical models developed by the members of our team.',\n"," 'Mapping the Host Galaxy Dynamics of a Possible GW Recoiling AGN. A peculiar AGN, 2MASX J00423991+3017515, has been identified that may be an example of an AGN that is recoiling from the asymmetric emission of gravitational waves following the merger of two progenitor supermassive black holes. The broad Balmer emission lines in its optical spectrum show a kinematic offset of ~1540 km/s from their respective narrow line emission, and the AGN itself appears spatially offset by 3.8 kpc from the center of its host galaxy. Despite presenting a comprehensive multiband spectroscopic and imaging analysis, the discovery paper (Hogg et al. 2021) could not conclusively determine the objects nature because one critical diagnostic was missing: a spatially resolved measurement of the host galaxy dynamics. We propose 1\" angular resolution and ~10 km/s spectral resolution observations of the CO (1-0) line to map the kinematics of 2MASX J00423991+3017515s kpc scale molecular gas. The primary goal is to determine the dynamical ``center\" of the galaxy and if the AGN is appreciably displaced from it. If so, it will bolster case that this object is a bona fide GW recoiling AGN and provide a new, indirect constraint on SMBH spin evolution and merger rates.',\n"," 'Tracing the dense, star forming gas and AGN feedback in z=2-4 galaxies via the shape of the CO line SED.. Recent HERSCHEL observations of the CO line SED in local IR luminous galaxies have demonstrated that the CO levels are excited at least up to the CO(13-12) transition and that the relative strengths of the J_up>10 transitions carries valuable information on the gas excitation and possibly signs of AGN heating. Our observations of z~4 QSOs support the interpretation that AGN heating has a significant influence on the shape of the CO SED at the highest CO levels but a contribution of the dense, star-forming gas is expected too. We here propose to obtain information on the shape of the CO SED for transitions between J=8-7 and 14-13 in the three best studied high redshift (z=2.5-4.1) galaxies observable with ALMA. With the observations we aim to study the effect of extreme star-formation and AGN heating on the intensities of the J_up>10 transitions at high redshift and to investigate the underlying excitation channels. The data will provide the first comparison sample to HERSCHEL observations in the local universe in less extreme environments. Our results will have impact on prime science goals for full ALMA array such as the observability of CO lines in galaxies at the epoch of re-ionisation. This project requires relatively short integrations which make it a highly suitable project for early ALMA high impact science.',\n"," 'Confirming FIR [O III] emission from a candidate z ~ 10 galaxy. We propose ALMA Band 7 observations of a secure candidate for a strongly-lensed z = 10 Lyman break galaxy to confirm a tentative detection of the [O III] 88 micron line we made in our A-graded Cycle 6 program. Given the extremely-high brightness of the [O III] line, which has been demonstrated by our recent ALMA detections of the [O III] line in z = 7-9 LBGs, the proposed study allows us to not only confirm the spectroscopic redshift of the z = 10 candidate LBG, but also characterize metal enrichment for the first time when the age of the Universe was only 480 Myr. The observations will place a stringent limit on metallicity of this LBG even in the case of non-detection of the line. ALMA will therefore provide a very unique opportunity before the JWST era that allows a tantalizing glimpse into the earliest production of heavy elements.',\n"," 'The Structure of the Arp 220 Disks from the Optically Thinnest Part of the Spectrum. We propose to use ALMA in the longest baseline configuration to observe the nuclei of Arp 220, the closest ultraluminous galaxy, at ~90 GHz. Doing so, we will obtain high spatial resolution kinematics of the inner disk and image the blended dust, synchrotron, and thermal continuum. Band 3 represents the most optically thin part of the continuum SED in Arp 220 and is the regime in which all three emission mechanisms play an important role. This makes it a key regime for continuum studies of the inner disk. Meanwhile bright lines in this regime offer a chance to study the poorly understood inner kinematics (dispersion and rotation) of the disks. We will use our proposed line and continuum observations to measure the dynamics of the inner (<100 pc) part of each nucleus, and --- using our matched 0.1\" resolution VLA continuum maps --- resolved spectral index maps. Together these measurements will provide critical new information on the structure of the inner disks, the nature of the mass distribution, and the distribution of recent star formation and cosmic ray electrons.',\n"," 'What can hubs tell us on massive star formation?. Despite the importance of massive stars in galaxy evolution, the process through which their progenitors are built remains highly controversial. Our ALMA cycle 0 results showed that one of the most massive cores ever observed in the Galaxy is forming at the converging point of a network of dense filaments, or hub. The data suggest that the large infall rate required to form this core is powered by the global collapse of the cloud. Here we propose to perform a first test of the universality of this scenario by mapping the fragmentation and kinematics of 5 massive infrared dark hubs with the objective of determining what key properties of the parental clouds determine the mass of the most massive cores.',\n"," 'The Fine Structure of an Extreme, Lensed Starburst Galaxy at z=5.7. We propose to observe a full diagnostic suite of five far-IR fine structure lines in an extraordinary starburst galaxy at the end of cosmic reionization. Through the power of gravitational lensing, our observations will measure the metallicity, radiation field, density, kinematics, and AGN effects with effective resolution of a few hundred parsecs, which has only been possible to date in the nearest star-forming galaxies. SPT0346-52, at z=5.7, already has high-resolution maps of the dust continuum and low-J CO emission, as well as integrated measurements of mid-J CO, [CII], and full radio-to-IR SED coverage. These observations effectively complement Herschel studies of local ULIRGs, and extend the study of these lines to the first Gyr of cosmic history. The high sensitivity, high resolution studies made possible by ALMA will address several key questions about the first stages of galaxy evolution, including the production of heavy elements, stellar and AGN feedback mechanisms, the energetics of the ISM, and the dynamics of the first galaxies.',\n"," 'Further high resolution observations of two binaries AGB stars: R Aqr and omi Cet. Binary stars including an AGB star hold the clues for understanding important phenomena in stellar evolution, such as common envelope events, the formation of SN Ia, and the origin of aspherical pPNe/PNe. Hydrodynamical codes, simulating the companions influence on the primarys mass loss, are mature. However, we still lack information on the orbital parameters of systems where these hydro-models can be thoughtfully tested. The two best cases where this can be pursued are R Aqr, a close symbiotic system, and omi Cet, the closest resolved binary AGB star. We propose new 12m C-10 observations in bands 6 and 7 to obtain the relative positions of the two stars for epoch ~2023.7 in R Aqr and omi Cet systems. We plan to self-calibrate the data with SiO masers to obtain optimum image fidelity in the continuum. In the case of R Aqr, the observation of RRLs and HCO+ will help in locating the secondary and provide information on its velocity. This will be crucial for the determination of the orbital parameters, but also the masses of the stars and the distance to the systems. In the case of omi Cet, the new data will help in testing the presence of a third star in the system.',\n"," '[CII]LIBRATE: The first systematic comparison of [CII] and CO(1-0) in high-z galaxies. Measuring the molecular gas content of z>4 galaxies is critical for our understanding of the stellar mass buildup in the early Universe. However, in this redshift range, traditional tracers such as low-J CO emission become increasingly unreliable. While recent observational and theoretical work suggests that the bright [CII] emission can be a powerful alternative tracer of molecular gas, its reliability has not been properly assessed, and the [CII]-to-Mgas conversion factor remains highly uncertain (to 1.5 dex). To settle these issues, we propose [CII]LIBRATE - the first systematic comparison of [CII] and CO(1-0) - the best tracer of molecular gas - in the same high-z galaxies. We will target [CII] 158-um emission in 13 z=3-5 galaxies with legacy CO(1-0) JVLA imaging. In total, we request request 9 hrs of ALMA Bands 7 and 8 observations at ~0.5\" resolution. This programme will establish the relation between [CII] luminosity and CO(1-0)-derived gas masses for high-z galaxies and determine the [CII]-to-Mgas conversion factor to within 0.2 dex. At a small time expense, this project will present a breakthrough in galaxy evolution studies at high redshift.',\n"," 'Resolved, direct imaging of the obscured star forming regions in SMGs. Submillimeter-luminous galaxies (SMGs) are extremophiles in the spectrum of high-z star forming galaxies, with star formation rates higher than almost all other objects in the known Universe. Yet despite their enormous luminosities, a number of factors conspire (faintness/dust-obscuration in the optical, limiting resolution of longer wavelength telescopes) which leave few clues as to the actual distribution of the star formation, or what is triggering their massive bursts. With ALMA in Cycle 1, the situation is fundamentally changed. The resolution/sensitivity is now such that one can resolve the obscured star forming regions in SMGs in the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) - the most direct tracer of star formation in dusty starburst galaxies - at resolutions comparable to what Herschel has achieved in nearby galaxies (~1 kpc). To this end, we propose 870 micron (Band 7) imaging of a statistically-significant sample of 15 SMGs employing ALMAs most extended configuration. The proposed targets were carefully selected from our ALMA Cycle 0 compact array (1.4\") survey of >100 SMGs, the largest, most homogenous, and highest-sensitivity sample of interferometrically observed SMGs to date, and they all have deep existing or forthcoming HST/WFC3 imaging. We will spatially-resolve the obscured star forming regions in these ALMA-confirmed SMGs on scales down to 0.16\" (equivalent to ~1.3 kpc at the median redshift of z~2.5), directly addressing two of the biggest observational unknowns regarding the SMG population: (1) How is the star formation distributed? and (2) What are the star formation rate densities of the starbursts? This proposal will provide the observational foundation necessary to discriminate between the various models which have been put forward to explain the extreme star formation rates of SMGs, including major mergers, isolated disks undergoing secular bursts/cosmological gas accretion, or some combination thereof. Requiring just 4 hours, this project is possible for the first time with ALMA in Cycle 1, and it will produce significant scientific results in an area that, until now, existed firmly in the realm of theory.',\n"," 'Are supersonic linewidths in massive star formation regions intrinsically subsonic?. Our high resolution ALMA observations of the massive Orion molecular cloud (OMC) show that most of the dense gas traced by N2H+ are subsonic. This finding indicates that more massive star forming clouds such as OMC may be intrinsically no different from the nearby Taurus cloud in its non-thermal linewidths, and that unresolved systematic motions within the telescope beam increase the linewidths. Should this be true, it would fundamentally revise the current picture of high-mass star formation. We choose a nearby, massive star formation region NGC6334, to test whether massive clouds have the subsonic linewidth as in OMC2/3. We propose to obtain high fidelity mosaic images in 3mm dust continuum and N2H+, HNC, CH3CN, HC3N lines of two massive areas in the NGC6334. One is the massive infrared dark cloud G350 located in the south of NGC6334. For comparison, we also choose a massive, active star formation clump NGC6334 I(n). The proposed study will (1) provide a high spectral and spatial resolution to resolve the non-thermal linewidth in this high-mass star formation, (2) investigate the influence of the feedback on the star-forming activities through the selected spectral lines.',\n"," 'The early coevolution of galaxies and black holes. We propose observations of the dust continuum and of one high-J CO transition in six heavily obscured QSOs residing in SMGs at z>2.5 in the CDFS. All QSOs are obscured by an X-ray column density of NH>3e23 cm-2. Their hosts are massive (M*>1e11 Msun) and feature vigorous star formation rates (SFR>300 Msun/yr). Through band 4 observations with 0.3\" FWHM resolution, i.e. half-light radius ~1 kpc at the median target redshift, we will measure the morphology and compactness of star formation and the mass and density of the ISM. With 5 hr of ALMA time (including overheads) we will assess whether: 1) star formation is taking place in a compact (~0.5-2 kpc) region, with size similar to that of compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs) at z<2. This, coupled to other physical quantities such as SFR, stellar mass, gas depletion time, would reveal whether our targets are the likely progenitors of cQGs; 2) the host gas density is so high that it can produce most of the nuclear absorption measured from the X-ray spectra. This might help explaining why the fraction of heavily obscured QSOs has been observed to increase with redshift.',\n"," 'Using [CI]to determine the distribution and heating mechanism of H2 in a z=4.8 star-forming disk. In Cycle 0 we identified a large, rotating [CII] disk in a strongly star-forming galaxy at z=4.8, ALESS73.1. Its [CII] line emission extends well beyond the host galaxy, tracing unknown distributions of ionized (HII), atomic (HI) and molecular (H2) gas (De Breuck et al. 2014). Here we propose resolution-matched, [CI] (1-0) & (2-1) imaging, whose low critical densities and umbiquity in H2 gas clouds (without significant contamination from HII or HI gas, and not subject to cosmic ray destruction) promise a powerful new luminous tracer of H2 gas in galaxies. Our goals include: a) determine the full extent, gas mass and enclosed dynamical mass of H2 disks, b) uncover potentially serious biases of the bright [CII] line in tracing H2 gas in galaxies, and c) determine whether FUV photons from the starburst can maintain the average thermal state of the dense H2 gas. The latter strongly impacts on the initial conditions of star formation and whether they can be reset in such disks. Thanks to its fortuitous redshift (allowing both [CI] and [CII] lines to be observed), and its unlensed isolated nature, ALESS73.1 is an excellent testbed for spatially resolved ISM studies.',\n"," 'An Unbiased Survey of Disk Structures and Planet Formation around Very Low-mass Stars in Taurus. High-resolution ALMA images of dust disks reveal that some disks are large and exhibit exquisite substructures, while others are small and may lack substructures. Since most of these are images of disks around 0.5-2 Msun stars, the stellar mass range is insufficient to use as a lever arm for correlations of disk morphology versus stellar mass. We request high resolution (0.05\") images of 8 very low-mass (0.1-0.3 Msun) T Tauri disks in a larger sample that also includes 6 archival objects, selected to be unbiased to substructures and mm-brightness, to evaluate the differences in the dust morphology in disks versus stellar mass. The ultimate goal is to understand how the differences at the disk stage relate to differences in the population of exoplanets around very low-mass and solar-mass stars. The sample is complete for disks around M3-M5 stars, with selection criteria for extinction, known binaries and declination. These observations provide an important complement to unbiased, high-resolution surveys of disks around solar-mass stars in Taurus and other nearby regions.',\n"," 'A new Benchmark for CO Excitation in Normal High-z Galaxies. Observations of molecular gas in high redshift galaxies rely critically on the correction factors between the ground and excited states of CO, the golden standard to measure molecular gas masses. Yet, excitation studies of normal galaxies at high-z are still limited to a very small number of sources and transitions. Here, we propose to greatly expand our knowledge by observing a reference sample of 13 galaxies from the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey (ASPECS) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. These galaxies range from being on, above and below the galaxy main sequence at z=1-3. All targets have deep CO, [CI] and continuum data in Band 3 and 6 from the ASPECS Large Program and benefit from a wealth of multi-wavelength data. The requested observations are critical to break existing degeneracies in the CO excitation, CO-to-H2 conversion factor and physical ISM conditions. We will observe low and high-J CO transitions in Band 4, 5 and 7, while simultaneously observing [CI] and the dust continuum for free. As these same sources are used for measuring the faint-end of the CO LF, these data also provide key constraints on rho(H2) and continue to build the legacy value of the ASPECS Sample.',\n"," 'Unveiling the nature of a huge cold gas reservoir ~18 kpc away from the powerful radio galaxy at z = 5.2. We propose the [CII] 158 um line and adjacent rest-160 um continuum observations of TN J0924-2201 at z=5.2 using ALMA Band-7, in order to investigate the feeding and feedback processes in one of the most distant powerful radio galaxies known. Specifically, this source is exceptionally gas-rich among HzRGs, with a huge (Mgas~10^11 Msun) and off-center cold molecular gas reservoir detected in CO(1-0) line, indicating that TN J0924 is in a short-lived but crucial gas-rich phase during the growth of the most massive galaxies. Although JVLA CO(1-0) measurement shows the intriguing spatial distribution, its S/N is too low for kinematic studies. Deep ALMA [CII] observation will allow us to study the kinematic properties of the gas reservoir (to see if it is e.g., infalling, outflowing, or rotating) and the physical properties of the circumgalactic medium (using PDR models). Furthermore, we will search for signatures of large-scale shocks via [CII]/CO(1-0) ratios, and assess the star formation rate of the gas reservoir (to see if it associates with significant star formation). TN J0924 is known to reside in a significant overdense region, and we will search for dusty companion galaxies.',\n"," 'A Search for Shocks in the Rare Massive Merging Cluster SPT-CLJ2031-4037. Galaxy cluster mergers are important and rare laboratories for understanding the properties of dark matter. ALMA and the ACA have been used to detected, image, and characterize shocks in a few remarkable merging galaxy clusters: El Gordo, RXJ1347.5-1145, and the Bullet Cluster. Notably, these observations required similar or shorter obserations that X-ray observations providing comparable constraints on the shock properties. Further, the constraints driven by the ACA data, rather than the ALMA 12-meter data. We propose here ACA observations of a binary merger found (but not discovered) in South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, which exploited the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect to discover hundreds of clusters from a region about 1/16 the full sky. These observations will provide a complementary view to recently obtained Chandra observations, unambiguously determining where the shocks are located and what their Mach numbers are.',\n"," 'Feedback Chemistry in Gas Infall and Outflows of the Most Active Massive Starburst Galaxies at Redshifts 2-5. Feedback regulated star formation throughout the history of the universe. The ground-state transitions of light hydrides are ideal tracers of stellar feedback in massive starburst galaxies back to the first billion years of cosmic time. We here propose to use the key oxygen hydrides to probe the molecular ion chemistry associated with outflowing and infalling gas vs. material found at the active sites of star formation in a statistically meaningful manner by detecting H2O+ in 40 z=2-5 starbursts with strong OH+ signatures. We will measure variations in abundances and column/volume densities and fractional ionization, as is critical to calculate mass/momentum outflow/infall rates of the gas supply for the starbursts in different phases and the local physical conditions in the absorbing layers, linking them to the star formation properties. These measurements will be key to understand the nature of the turbulent gas entailed in the large-scale outflows and infall associated with massive galaxies in the early universe in their peak starburst phase, and how they impact the resulting stellar population seen in their present-day counterparts at the end of the mass buildup process.',\n"," 'Black Hole Dynamics and Achromaticity in the Shadow of Sgr A*. Black holes are the only objects in the Universe that allow us to probe fundamental physics from stellar to supermassive scales. They host extreme astrophysical environments near their event horizons with relativistic motion, high temperature plasmas, and powerful magnetic fields. The Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, is the only black hole we can observe in detail from the feeding source down to the event horizon. Here, we propose to use ALMA in a global VLBI array to capture and trace the plasma activities in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon of Sgr A*. The short dynamical time scale and daily broadband flares offer unique opportunities to study dynamics near the event horizon resolved in both time and space. The proposed observation will enable us to: 1) significantly improve the fidelity of horizon-scale Sgr A* images and enable movie reconstruction with better interferometric coverage; 2) understand the origins of near-horizon plasma variability; 3) resolve the base of a jet, if it exists; and 4) provide an independent test of the scale-invariance of the black hole spacetime.',\n"," 'Revealing Binarity and the Youngest Disks in Oph. We propose a survey of multiplicity toward all known Class 0 and Class I/II protostars in Oph (75 sources). Using a dust continuum sensitivity of 0.1 Jupiter masses, we will probe the binarity of these sources from 15 AU out to 1000 AU, which well samples the peak of the main-sequence and pre-main sequence binary separation distributions (30 and 60 AU) toward the younger protostars for the first time. Combining with our Perseus VLA 8mm continuum survey, we will have 130 sources (great statistics) in two clouds, which will mitigate concerns of environment. This is the largest and most complete high-resolution millimeter-wave survey of protostellar binaries ever undertaken and will significantly improve our understanding of the formation mechanisms and prevalence of close binaries during the early stages of star formation. In addition, the survey will also be perfect for detecting protostellar circumstellar disks. There are currently only 3 disks in Class 0 sources known, so this project will increase the number of candidate Class 0 and I disks, help resolve the current controversy on early disk properties, and constrain disk formation scenarios that are hotly debated.',\n"," 'Probing Dust and Gas Evolution in Disks: The pivotal Chamaeleon II association. Dust in Protoplanetary disks dissipates with typical timescales of ~3 Myr. By 10Myr, very few disks are detected and little primordial material is left. The formation of gaseous planets must be complete by then. However, this is based almost entirely on measurements of the continuum, of dust, and it assumes that the gas dissipates on the same timescale. Very little information is available regarding the gas dispersal timescale. The Cha II association has an estimated age of about 3-4Myr. The disk detection rate in Cha II, as seen by continuum, is down to ~50% for KM stars making Cha II a perfect place to study disk evolution at the critical time when they evolve rapidly. For comparison the same fraction is ~80% in the 1-2Myr Taurus and Rho Oph. We propose to survey all known K&M stars with disks of the Chamaeleon II association to measure the band 6 continuum and resolve the disk sizes. We also propose to observe three CO isotopologues to search for the presence cold gas. The sample is carefully selected in stellar mass and will be readily comparable, including gas for the first time,with younger associations with minimum biases.',\n"," 'Constraining the Mass of the Planet in the Gap Discovered in the TW Hya Disk. We propose to observe the 13CO and C18O J=3-2 line emission towards TW Hya with high spatial resolution and high sensitivity in order to detect a gas gap in the disk. Our cycle 3 DDT multiple-band observations show multiple gap structure in dust continuum emission and an enhancement of dust spectral index at the gap at the disk radius of 22AU, which suggests the gap is likely to be caused by a planet. This proposal aims to constrain the mass of the planet by measuring the depth and width of the gas gap at 22AU. In order to derive the planet mass precisely, we need to know the properties of the gas gap, rather than the dust gap, since the distribution of dust is affected by dust filtration. At the 22 AU gap, the C18O line is optically thin and a good tracer of gas surface density distributions together with the optically thick 13CO line as a tracer of gas temperature at the gap. Our cycle 4 observations have been partially performed and show a hint of gas gap at 22AU. This proposal is to complete out cycle 4 observations. This will be a pioneering study of the formation environment of a planetary system, taking advantage of the TW Hyas proximity.',\n"," 'A multiphase investigation of AGN feedback. The broad scientific objective of this project is to advance in our understanding of AGN feedback and its connection with the galaxies molecular gas reservoirs. We propose to perform the first multiphase characterization of outflow properties (size, geometry, kinematics and mass) in a sample of nearby and luminous type-2 quasars (QSO2s). By combining the requested ALMA observations with available VLT/SINFONI data we will study the properties of the line-emitting gas in the ionized, hot and cold molecular phases for a pilot sample of 7 QSO2s. These AGN are drawn from a larger sample and are representative of the luminous QSO2 population in terms of bolometric and radio luminosity, morphology and SFR. We will also investigate for quasar circum-nuclear disks (CNDs) of molecular gas, characterize them and study their connection with the host galaxy via outflows. We ultimately wish to answer the important questions of whether quasars with luminous outflows differ in terms of the molecular gas reservoirs from those without outflows and/or whether there is a dependency with the outflow properties.',\n"," 'Building a sample of [NII] 122 and 205 micron emission lines in high-z dusty star forming galaxies.

The formation mechanism(s) of brown dwarfs (BDs, M<0.08 Msun) has been a longstanding problem. Resolving it requires studying their properties in the embedded phase (proto-BDs). We aim to identify a potential proto-BD, IRAS16253. Our SMA CO(2-1) map reveals two protostellar jets, suggesting it is a binary system. The low mass of parent core (<0.5 Msun) implies that the central objects may accrete only very limited material later. Thus, IRAS16253 is likely forming one or two BDs depending on the current masses and the future accretion. The CO jet shows periodic line-of-sight velocity variations along the jet axes which likely originate from the binary orbital motion. We fit the data with our model and deduce a binary separation of 69 au and orbital velocities of 0.52 and 0.10 km/s for the two components. This result implies masses of the central components of 0.026 and 0.006 Msun, which hints at IRAS 16253 being a proto-BD binary. We propose to observe C18O (2-1), CO (2-1), and dust continuum at 217 GHz to confirm the predicted binary separation and the velocities of the components. This will enable us, for the first time, to identify a proto-BD binary system through dynamics.',\n"," 'REBELS: An ALMA Large Program to Discover the Most Luminous [CII]+[OIII] Galaxies in the Reionization Epoch. REBELS will construct the first large statistical samples of high-luminosity [CII]+[OIII]-emitting galaxies in the reionization epoch. REBELS will identify these bright galaxies by systematically targeting the 40 UV-brightest galaxies found over 7 deg^2 and pursuing spectral scans (using band-6/5 [CII] searches at z<8.5 and band-7 [OIII] searches at z>8.5 for maximal efficiency). Already, on the basis of our 1+11-hour pilot programs, five of the seven most luminous [CII]-emitting galaxies known at z~7 have been identified. From the ~25-30 high-luminosity [CII]+[OIII]-emitting galaxies discovered with REBELS (from z~9.5 to 6.5), we will (1) map out the bright end of the z>6.5 [CII]+IR luminosity functions and their evolution, (2) break the high-z spectroscopic redshift record for line-emitters, and (3) create statistical samples of high-mass galaxies needed to characterize dust and stellar mass growth in the early universe while gaining a view of their kinematic structure. Compellingly, REBELS will provide the community with the bright, [CII]+[OIII]-emitting galaxies urgently required for efficient scientific discovery at z>6 with ALMA and JWST.',\n"," 'What is the origin of rotational motions in dense cores?. Rotation of star-forming dense cores plays essential roles in star and planet formation. Its origin is, however, not fully understood yet. Nevertheless, recent theoretical simulations suggest that a small velocity fluctuation within filamentary clouds could turns out to be rotation in dense cores formed in the filamentary clouds through their self-gravitational fragmentation. In order to follow up this tantalizing suggestion, we propose to carry out ACA+TP observations of 30 pre-stellar dense cores homogeneously selected in the B211/B213 single filamentary cloud of the Taurus star forming region. The 30 pre-stellar cores cover the central density of 10^4-10^6 cm^-3 representing various evolutionary stages, which allows us to investigate how the kinematics within cores evolves. The observations will be made in C18O, N2D+, and SO lines in Band 6 at 7\" resolution, which is high enough to spatially resolve each pre-stellar core. The obtained results, which can be directly compared with theoretical simulations, enable us to observationally investigate first time how turbulent motions in filamentary clouds evolve into rotational motions in cores during the core formation and evolution.',\n"," 'Monitoring the first ever detected accretion burst from a massive (proto)star: How accretion turns into ejection. This is a resubmission of a recent ALMA proposal for DDT, motivated by new JVLA data that not only confirm the increase of the source continuum flux at radio wavelengths, but clearly demonstrate that the free-free emission is expected to dominate the emission at 3mm and 2mm. Our goal is to study the evolution of the free-free continuum emission tracing jet ejection from the first ever detected accretion burst from a massive young stellar object (S255 NIRS3). We stress that this is not just a peculiar source, but key to understand how early-type stars form: the presence of accretion bursts is discriminant to decide whether such stars form through disk-mediated accretion like solar-type stars, or other mechanisms are required. By combining the monitoring at 3mm and 2mm with that ongoing with the JVLA from 5GHz to 44GHz, we have the unique chance to determine how the accretion burst affects the outflow process. For this purpose, we will determine fundamental quantities like expansion speed and mass loss rate. Moreover, we will compute the ratio between accretion rate (obtained from our IR observations) and mass loss rate, a crucial parameter for star formation models.',\n"," 'Searching for massive starless core candidates in proto-stellar clusters. Whether massive starless cores exist or not is crucially important to test different models of high-mass star formation. Very massive (M>30 Msun) starless core candidates have been found in some case studies of evolved proto-stellar clusters, which may represent the very initial conditions of high-mass star formation. However, systemic searching for starless cores in proto-stellar clusters, has not been done yet. To this end, here we propose high resolution ALMA band 6 observations of a 140 high-mass proto-stellar clusters. We aim: (1) to search for candidate massive starless cores; (2) to study core mass growth by comparing the core mass functions (CMFs) for starless cores and for proto-stellar cores; (3) to investigate the effect of stellar feedback on core properties. Only through observing such a large sample one can figure out whether or not massive starless cores are common in proto-stellar clusters and what their properties are. The data will be used in the thesis works of several PhD students.',\n"," 'How to Feed a Torus: Resolving the center of Circinus. AGN tori are fundamentally important components in models of active black holes, however their typical sizes, geometry, and structure are poorly constrained.

These observations will resolve the compact torus and the distribution of surrounding gas on scales from 0.4-300 pc and constrain the kinematics of the gas flow toward one of the nearest AGN (a Type 2 Seyfert at d=4.2 Mpc). We will measure the density of gas in the torus and its larger-scale surroundings and test chemical (e.g. X-ray Dominated Region or XDR) models for gas around an AGN. The lack of star formation in the nucleus of this galaxy will allow us to use these measurements to uniquely isolate and resolve the impact of the AGN on a galaxys central gas reservoir.',\n"," 'ALMA Zooms in on Planet Formation in a Nearby Disk Orbiting Twin Young Suns. Planets form in circumstellar disks of gas and dust orbiting young stars. In the era of ALMA, imaging of dusty (submm-luminous) protoplanetary disks can achieve 20-30 mas angular resolution, comparable to that of visible/near-IR (scattered-light) imaging of disks using EAO instrumentation on 8-meter-class telescopes. This potential is best exploited by imaging the nearest known planet-forming disks, for which ALMAs spatial resolution approaches AU size scales. Here, we propose extended-configuration ALMA 870 continuum and CO imaging of the massive, evolved circumbinary disk orbiting the close binary system V4046 Sgr (D ~ 73 pc), one of the nearest known and most intriguing protoplanetary disks. These observations will yield an unsurpassed benchmark with which to test models describing grain growth and migration processes that are predicted to accompany planet building, and to investigate planet formation in the giant and terrestrial planet-forming regions of a binary system consisting of twin young solar analogs.',\n"," 'Winds of change II - imaging the extremely young outflow of the FIR-excess galaxy NGC1377. We propose high resolution 0.\"16 (13 pc) Band 7 ALMA CO 3-2 and continuum observations of the dusty, young molecular wind and core of the extreme FIR excess galaxy NGC1377. The extreme spatial resolution and sensitivity offered by ALMA and the proximity of NGC1377 allow us to image the morphology and velocity structure of the outflow down to the very nucleus of the galaxy. The acceleration, mass outflow rate and wind driving mechanism can be addressed as well as the nature of the dust obscured nuclear power source. We also propose Band 9 CO 6-5 and continuum observations to address the physcial conditions of the nuclear gas, search for a Compton thick nucleus, constrain the continuum luminosity density of the nucleus testing the notion of a buried AGN. Resolving the outflow of NGC1377 will help us understand how galactic winds are triggered, how they evolve and the role they play in the overall evolution of galaxies. Mounting evidence suggest that molecular outflows may be common in AGNs and starburst galaxies where they regulate star formation and growth of supermassive black holes.',\n"," 'Characterizing Rapid sub-mm Variability in a Bright Black Hole X-ray Binary Outburst. Relativistic jets are fundamentally linked to the accretion process onto compact objects. This makes objects that evolve rapidly through different states of accretion strong probes of jet phenomena. Entire outbursts of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) can evolve on days-months timescales, making them ideal targets. While broad-band spectral measurements are traditionally used to constrain jet properties during BHXB outbursts, variability measurements offer a new avenue to probe jet properties. Our team has recently identified extreme flux variability in jet emission from BHXBs at 5-666 GHz. We propose targeting the next bright (> 50 mJy) outbursting BHXB with a 4 hr ALMA Band 7 ToO observation. With these data we will characterize sub-mm flux variability on timescales of seconds-hours in a BHXB, constraining the jet size and the time lag between the Band 7 subbands. By combining this ALMA observation with our approved VLA, VLBA, SMA, and ASTROSAT ToO projects, we will create an additional detailed probe of jet physics by comparing BHXB jet and accretion variability across radio, sub-mm, & X-ray frequencies, all while simultaneously tracking changes in jet morphology.',\n"," 'Searching for substructures in young protoplanetary disks. Young protoplanetary disks around protostars play a fundamental role in the process of planet formation, since they contain the ingredients that will form planets. For a long time, the only tests to planet formation theories were in our own Solar system. This has changed completely over the last years with the discovery of a variety of protoplantary disks and planetary systems. However, it is not yet clear at which stage of the star and planet formation process dust grains start to efficiently coagulate and evolve from small solid particles to macroscopic dimensions. In this context, our proposal will focus into unveil the hidden subssctructures and geometry of two Class Is disk located in the Perseus molecular cloud using high resolution and multiwavelength observations. We will measure for the first time the level of of grain growth at scales of few tens of au in these young disks. Additionally, with no extra cost of observing time, we aim to detect a variaty of CO isotopologues ir order to characterize the rotationally supported disks by comparing their gas and dust structures.',\n"," 'A shocking exploration of phosphorus astrochemistry. Phosphorus remains an an astrochemical enigma in dense star-forming regions: while the emission of PN and PO seems to be correlated with shocks, we still do not understand the underlying chemistry. With only two spatially resolved detections of P molecules to date, additional resolved observations are urgently needed to make progress. This program will target phosphrous molecules towards three nearby protostars with diverse shock environments and bright single-dish detections of PN, providing an ideal test bed for exploring the drivers of phosphorus astrochemistry. By covering PN and PO lines in ALMA Bands 3, 4, and 6 at 1\" resolution, we will constrain the molecular column densities, excitation conditions, and emission origins. With this we can test, for the first time, what conditions are needed to eject P into the gas, and how the gas-phase P chemistry depends on a wide range of environmental factors. This program will help illuminate the journey of phosphorus, a key bioelement, in dense star-forming regions. And, with an improved understanding of their chemistry, gas-phase P molecules may become a valuable probe of the chemistry and physics of astrophysical shocks.',\n"," 'A Closer Look at the Small Disks. A consensus is emerging from recent high resolution ALMA images that dust substructures are present in most disks. However, our unbiased 0.1 arcsec resolution disk survey of mm-sized dust in Taurus reveals two distinct groups of disks: some are large with gaps and rings, while others are compact and have smooth radial profiles. The large and the compact disks both have inner regions with similar brightnesses, so the lack of rings at large radii for the compact dust disks is not directly caused by sensitivity. We request two sets of observations for five compact disks (20-50 au radius) to test disk formation and evolution. First, we will use CO observations with 0.3 arcsec resolution to measure the gas disk size. Second, we will obtain 0.02 arcsec images of the 1.3 mm continuum to detect any small-scale disk substructures. The size of the gas disk will indicate whether the disk was born small or whether radial drift of mm-sized grains is efficient. The presence of substructures at small radii would demonstrate that drift of mm-sized dust was halted by dust traps; the lack of substructures would indicate an absence of giant planets on scales comparable to our solar system.',\n"," 'The Mass Accretion Reservoir Surrounding a Variably Accreting Young Star. We propose to obtain band 6 continuum observations of the new FU Orionis object HBC722, which was first observed to flare in 2010 and remains in the elevated state to the present day. The flares associated with FUors are generally attributed to enhanced accretion from the surrounding circumstellar disk. Recent SMA and PdBI observations of HBC722 did not detect a circumstellar disk down to an upper limit of 0.02 solar masses, already making it the lowest mass FUor disk known by at least a factor of 3. Our proposed observations will provide approximately 50 times better mass sensitivity than possible with the SMA or PdBI and will probe down to a disk mass of 4.2E-4 solar masses. With these data we will study the physical properties of the HBC722 disk, the evolutionary status of HBC722, and the driving mechanism of the current flare.',\n"," 'Dissecting the H/H2 and C+/C/CO transitions of a prototypical PDR: ALMA and JWST observations of the Orion Bar. Bright PDRs in nearby star-forming clouds are the best laboratories to study the detailed structure, physics, and dynamics of UV-illuminated matter in the ISM. However, recent high-angular observations of the prototypical PDR, the Orion Bar, cannot be explained by \"standard\" 1D PDR models. This challenges their applicability to interpret the PDR emission from related environments (from disks to galaxies). We propose a combined ALMA and JWST-ERS study (data available in fall 2022) to spatially resolve - for the first time at sub-arcsec resolution - the structure of all relevant transition zones of this textbook PDR: from the HII/cloud interface to the H/H2 and C+/C/CO transition zones. Only ALMA can resolve the emission from the main carbon reservoirs C+, C, and CO, and constrain the unknown exact location, width, and kinematics of these zones (i.e., probing the conversion from atoms to molecules and the photo-erosion of PAHs and grains). These are crucial ingredients to benchmark a new class of models able to simulate the 3D and dynamical nature of PDRs.

These simulations suggest that the system might be susceptible to the recently-postulated ``disc tearing effect, where the gravitational torque of a misaligned companion tears the disc apart into distinct planes that precess independently around the central objects. The propose ALMA observations aim to detect the disc tearing effect for the first time observationally, which should appear as a prominent ring of 100 mas diameter that is misaligned with respect to the outer disc. The continuum data will constrain the physical conditions and dust properties, while our CO data will image gas streamers that might have been launched due to binary-disc interactions. This will allow us to constrain fundamental hydrodynamic parameters, such as the disc viscosity, and to study hydrodynamic effects such as dust filtration under well-defined conditions, providing a unique benchmark for planet formation studies.',\n"," 'The 90 mas imaging of a z = 8.312 galaxy: Benchmarking our understanding of galaxy formation. We propose 90 mas (430 pc) imaging of a z=8.312 Lyman break galaxy MACS0416_Y1, which has recently been detected in the [OIII] 88um and dust continuum emission in our A-graded Cycle 4 program. MACS0416_Y1 has three individual clumps of young stars, and the dust and [OIII] emission apparently traces the stellar distribution. So, one of naive questions is why the dust continuum and [OIII] emission are co-spatial with the UV continuum on ~ a few kpc scale, even though the UV continuum is blue. A possible explanation is patchy/porous geometry of dusty molecular clouds and ionized gas at sub-kpc scales, which are all suggested by state-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. However, the spatial resolution obtained with the current/upcoming data set from Cycle 4 and 5 (~0.3 arcsec) is not enough. In Cycle 6, we add longer baselines to spatially resolve the internal structures at 430 pc resolution, which is enough to spatially resolve possible giant HII regions, molecular associations, and supernova bubbles, allowing us to benchmark our understanding of galaxy formation through direct comparison with simulations when the age of the Universe was only 600 Myr.',\n"," 'Mapping the nitrile chemistry and dynamics of Titans thermosphere. The Cassini space mission has shown that Titans atmosphere is a complex system involving strong interactions between chemistry and dynamics. Titans stratosphere and lower mesosphere (150-500 km) is currently explored in details by Cassini/CIRS. At the top of the atmosphere, the thermosphere (900-1200 km) is currently explored by Cassini/INMS, but with a scarce sampling in latitude, altitude and local time. In between, Titans mesosphere/lower thermosphere region from 500 to 1000 km remains largely unexplored by Cassini. The main goals of this proposal are (i) to map the HNC(4--3) and HCN(4--3) lines in the upper atmosphere (500-1000 km), in order to constrain the chemistry, temperature and dynamics in this poorly known region. (ii) to take benefits of the large bandwidth of ALMA to simultaneously map other nitriles (HC3N and CH3CN) and search for an as-yet undiscovered nitrile (DCN).',\n"," 'Beaded Strings of Young Stellar Superclusters between Merging Elliptical Galaxies. We propose a Band 6 ALMA CO(3-2) observation to map a spectacular network of gravitationally unstable molecular filaments entwined amid the nuclei of two merging elliptical galaxies. The collapse of these 30 kpc-scale filaments fuels the birth of 19 young stellar superclusters or tidal dwarf galaxies, making this system one of the most unique known examples of so-called \"beads on a string\" star formation, a kpc-scale manifestation of the Jeans instability. Understanding both the origin and fate of this \"string of pearls: now rests on ALMA, which is the only facility capable of mapping cold molecular gas in this morphologically short-lived structure.',\n"," 'Searching for hot molecular cores in the extreme outer Galaxy. The recent discovery of a hot molecular core in a nearby low metallicity galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), suggests that the galactic metallicity has a significant effect on chemistry of warm and dense molecular gas associated with a protostar. While remarkable chemical differences are reported for the LMC hot core, it is still unclear if the observed chemical characteristics is essentially common in other low metallicity environments or it is unique only in the LMC. Here we propose ALMA observations to search for hot cores in the star-forming region at the edge of our Galaxy. The proposed target, WB89-789, is an active star-forming region located at the extreme outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance ~20 kpc), where the metallicity is lower than the solar neighborhood by a factor of four. The low metallicity environment of the outer Galaxy, which is common with the LMC, provide us an ideal laboratory to test the universality of the low metallicity molecular chemistry observed in the LMC. This proposal aims to elucidate a possible link between metallicity and hot core chemistry, particularly by focusing on properties of complex organic molecules and their parental species.',\n"," 'The role of OH outflows in the high redshift Universe. Why were ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z>1 such a major contributor to the star formation density at that epoch, yet they contribute less than a percent today? A likely driver may be changes in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. Herschel observations of hydroxyl (OH) have proven extremely efficient in characterising AGN-driven outflows in the local Universe, and showing that they are relatively common. These outflows provide the only direct evidence that fuel for star formation is being removed. What are the properties of these outflows in the early universe? Are they powered by the same mechanism? We propose to complete our novel study of AGN-driven outflows in 3 ULIRGs at redshifts 2.6-4.2, with the best available outflow diagnostic, OH, and the best available sample of gravitationally lensed sub-mm galaxies, using the flux amplification to maximise ALMAs sensitivity to this key diagnostic. Our program will be the first detailed study of OH properties in ULIRGs in the high-redshift Universe.',\n"," 'The nature and origin of the Solar system scale disk in the Helix Nebula. We intend to image the Solar system scale, dusty disk around the central star of the Helix nebula, the closest planetary nebula (PN, d=152 to 219pc). There are two scenarios for its origin: a Kuiper belt that survived the stellar post-main sequence (post-MS) evolution or a remnant post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (pAGB) disk that formed from material ejected by the star during that phase. We will measure the gas content and probe for large grains in the disk in order to distinguish between the two scenarios. The primordial Kuiper belt case: This will be the first Kuiper belt confirmed and imaged around a star that went through the post-MS evolution and the first direct evidence that planetary systems survive this phase. We will observationally investigate the effects of this phase on planetary/planetesimal systems. The remnant post-AGB disk case: We will measure its gas and dust mass to test predictions of evolutionary time scales of such disks. We will investigate whether second-generation planet(esimal) formation is possible there. Our observations will impact our understanding of the evolution of post-MS stars and their disks and on the binary hypothesis of PN formation.',\n"," 'A detailed study of the sub-pc jet of BL Lacertae at mm-wavelengths with the EHT+ALMA. AGN jets are key objects to broaden our knowledge of the Universe, on Black Hole and galaxy evolution, and on the impact of magnetic fields on this. Here we propose a joint observation on the nearby and archetypical AGN object BL Lacertae (BL Lac) with the EHT+ALMA at 1.3mm and in close coordination with the GMVA+ALMA at 3.5mm. By scheduling the 1.3mm and 3.5mm observations near-in-time (April/May 2023), we can image and study the innermost jet launching region on sub-parsec scales, a region which is still poorly understood. BL Lac is particularly close (redshift~0.069) and has a bright radio jet (overall > 3 Jy at 1mm). More importantly, its jet is highly polarized also in its inner region (close to the central engine). This facilitates a spectral index and rotation measure study with a spatial resolution of up to ~1600 Schwarzschild radii. We aim to study the configuration and strength of the jet magnetic field, the collimation/acceleration profile, and the physical conditions in the region close to the central, powering supermassive black hole.',\n"," 'A multi-phase view of the gas cycle in the innermost regions of nearby AGN. Radiation-driven fountain models of molecular tori and their associated outflows predict a complex nature for the neutral gas reservoir located in the inner tens of parsecs of AGN. We propose to image with a spatial resolution of 0.1\"(7-13pc) and a Largest Angular Scale goal of 4\"(300-500pc) the CI line and its underlying continuum emission of 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies to map the diffuse atomic gas component and the dust continuum emission from the tori up to the circumnuclear disks (CND) of our targets. Previous publicly-available ALMA observations of our sample revealed an order of magnitude range in the nuclear-scale dense molecular gas concentrations derived from the CO(3-2) line, as well as a wide range of properties of their tori. Our candidate sources are representative of different evolutionary stages of the AGN feeding-feedback cycle. This proposal aims at gaining a multi-phase view of the gas cycle by incorportating tracers of lower-density neutral gas, which will provide neatly different constraints to numerical simulations on the imprint left by AGN feedback locally on the tori and on the larger spatial scales of the CND of Seyfert galaxies.',\n"," 'WISDOM: From Small-Scale Strucutre to Galaxy-Scale Processes. Observations of molecular gas at both GMC and galactic scales in external galaxies are key to understanding the molecular cloud (MC) formation and the relation of small-scale structures to galaxy-scale processes. Although the exquisite resolution of ALMA allows us to effortlessly resolve individual GMCs in nearby galaxies, we have demonstrated a need for low-resolution ALMA maps in GMC studies to allow complete flux recovery and total mass measurement of cold gas. We aim to 1) accurately measure MC (including low-mass MCs) properties and study their relations to galactic environment, using a high-sensitivity map combining high- and low-resolution observations; 2) investigate Larsons relations in external galaxies; 3) study star formation relations from large galactic-scales and small GMC-scales; and 4) determine the conversion factor between CO flux and H2 mass using the virial mass method. Our work will use a uniform methodology to perform a comprehensive analysis of MCs properties across different galaxy environments. Our aim is to address multiple key open issues regarding MC formation/evolution and their relationship to the wider galactic environments.',\n"," 'Detecting hot quasar winds via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect. Quasar-driven winds can significantly impact their large-scale environments. The winds are likely composed of different phases including a hot volume-filling plasma and cooler, high-density clumps or filaments. The hot plasma is the most difficult to observe as any emission associated with it would be weak, yet investigating this component is crucial for characterizing quasar winds and quantifying their impact on the surrounding medium. The hot, volume-filling component of quasar winds can potentially be detected via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect, the scattering of CMB photons off of free electrons in the hot gas. The SZ effect creates a decrement below and an increment above 220 GHz in the observed spectral energy distribution (SED). We propose to observe two quasars at 90 GHz and 150 GHz to detect the decrement in the SED of the quasars due to the SZ effect. We also propose to observe the targets at 220 GHz, where the SZ signal is null, in order to anchor the SEDs relative to the SZ decrement. In carrying out these observations, we will open a new window into the studies of quasar feedback by detecting this effect in individual quasars for the first time.',\n"," 'Resolving the Cloud-Cluster Ecosystem in M33. We propose ACA 7m observations of the inner disk of M33, over a region which matches a new six-band photometric survey being conducted by the Hubble Space Telescope. The new HST survey will provide an unmatchable perspective on the cluster population and dust extinction map over a 25 square kpc region. By combining ACA-only observations with an in-hand map of the galaxy using the IRAM 30m telescope, we will achieve a high quality map of CO(2-1) over the same region as the HST survey7 with 7\" = 25 pc linear resolution. These data will constrain the lifetimes, mass accretion rates, and cluster formation properties of the molecular cloud population. These new results are essential for understanding how the structure of the molecular ISM and the evolution of clouds controls the effectiveness of stellar feedback. We will study the local variations in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor by pairing the CO data with high resolution HI (<= 6\" resolution) and the dust extinction map produced by HST (7\" resolution). This will isolate regions that are CO-dark molecular gas. Despite the northern declination, CASA simulations of our observation strategy show high quality maps will be achieved.',\n"," 'Detailed molecular gas distribution of an active star forming region within a low-metallicity environment: CO/CI observations of N83 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The aim of this observation is to reveal for the first time the detailed molecular gas distribution of an active star forming region within a low-metallicity environment to understand the formation and structure of GMCs as well as the star-formation process at low metalicity. We propose mosaic observations toward a molecular clump associated with the active star forming region N83 in the SMC in the J=2-1, 3-2 lines of 12CO and 13CO, and [CI] with a final angular resolution of 1.5 arcsec, corresponding to a spatial resolution of 0.44 pc. CO observations will be used to precisely determine the density and temperature of the gas, and in combination with the velocity information, we can investigate the dynamics of hot-dense molecular clumps associated with HII regions and cold-dense molecular clumps prior to massive star formation. [CI] line is also another important probe to reveal the distribution of molecular gas without CO emission, being a significant mass component of the cloud, affecting the systems self-gravity and providing an additional supply of gas to fuel star formation, and also a key to understand the variations of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor.',\n"," 'Caught red handed: dusty quasars blowing out molecular gas. The canonical picture of galaxy evolution invokes the injection of energy from supermassive black holes to reduce star formation efficiency in massive galaxies. However, the physical channels that allow energy and momentum released on sub-pc scales to affect gas on galactic scales are largely unconstrained. Theoretical models predict that radiation pressure on dust in the vicinity of the black hole is a major driving mechanism of galactic-scale outflows of cold gas. A recent study has found evidence for a direct link between quasar dust-reddening and molecular outflows. Here, we propose a survey of 10 reddened quasars at z=2.5 in CO(9-8) or CO(10-9) to investigate this relationship and explore the impact of radiative feedback on star-forming gas.',\n"," 'Revealing a new population of UC-HII regions with maser RRLs. The physical processes leading to formation of high mass stars is one of the most discussed issues in Astrophysics. This poorly known field has experienced some progress thanks to the detection of some circumstellar disks around massive stars supporting formation via monolithic collapse. The circumstellar disk with best known kinematics is that found toward the UC-HII region of MWC349A. The centroid map obtained of its RRL emission has turned out to be the best tool to study the geometry, physical characteristics and kinematics of its ionized disk and wind at small spatial scales. We intend to carry out a pilot survey of high-angular resolution by using ALMA to study the kinematics of ionized disks and winds in UC-HII regions with, potentially, RRL maser emission. However, their expected LTE intensities are enough strong to detect the Hnalpha RRLs with high signal-to-noise ratios by using ALMA and, therefore, to obtain their centroid maps with uncertainties of about a few milliarcseconds. The ALMA data would provide insight into the physical mechanisms of launching and shaping ionized winds with the ultimate goal of understanding monolithic massive star formation.',\n"," 'Probing the transition from protoplanetary to debris disc in the Herbig AeBe star HD141569. We propose to study with high resolution the circumstellar disc around the Herbig Ae/Be star HD141569. This disc currently sits in the middle of the poorly understood but very common transition from protoplanetary to debris disc, and its study offers a unique opportunity to understand how this rapid transition occurs and the dynamical processes that govern it. By characterizing the distribution of mm-sized dust we will determine if its multiple rings seen in scattered light observations are caused by the photoelectric instability (PeI) or planets at 10-200 au that carve gaps. Understanding the origin of the rings will also allow us to constrain the origin of its gas and dust, and thus determine if the disc material is protoplanetary or generated and resupplied by planetesimal collisions. In addition, its CO distribution and kinematics will allow us to constrain and test predictions of how the PeI or planets affect the distribution of gas in a low mass circumstellar disc. HD 141569 is the ideal target to study this transition phase.',\n"," 'Mass accretion onto the Super Massive Black Hole of M 87. Background: The rate of mass accretion onto Super Massive Black Holes is an essential parameter for active galactic nuclei. Goal of this Observation: With new polarization capabilities, we will derive the Faraday Rotation Measure (which is a tracer of column density) towards M 87 with 10 times better accuracy compared to our SMA pre-study. M 87 is a representative radio loud AGN. Scientific Impact: With 10 times more accurate RM, we will determine the mass accretion rate for the first time, while our SMA pre-study only allowed us to set an upper limit. It will enable us to discriminate accretion flow models and give us a unique opportunity to investigate the energy source of the jet (e.g., accretion and/or black hole spin). Why ALMA Cycle 3?: We need to investigate polarization properties in the vicinity of the beam center, but with high sensitivity (0.015 mJy/beam at Q and U) in band 3. Our sensitivity requirements can be only achieved with ALMA. In addition, we will use the RM measured from the more extended part of the jet to determine the foreground ISM contribution to the RM. That is useful information to confirm large RM is associated with accretion flow.',\n"," 'Spatially Resolving the Molecular Gas and Dust in the Highest Redshift HI-detected Galaxy. We propose to image the molecular gas and dust in the highest redshift HI detected galaxy in emission. While the optical image shows a relatively undisturbed strongly barred galaxy, its high star formation rate and cold gas properties depict a more complex picture. The total amount of cold gas exceeds 10^11 Msun, with comparable amounts of HI and H2. The VLA HI image shows that the atomic gas is highly asymmetric within the disk and extends far beyond it to the south. The LMT CO(1-0) spectrum shows a narrow component consistent with the HI width and a symmetric broad faint component, suggestive of an outflow. ALMA CO(3-2) and HCN(2-1) observations will provide the distribution, kinematics and density of the molecular gas. The high gas fraction and star formation properties makes it an ideal analog to the clumpy galaxies seen at higher redshift. This study will result in the first images of the cold hydrogen content (both atomic and molecular) for a galaxy beyond the local Universe.',\n"," 'AGN in the SPT2349 protocluster at z=4.31. We propose a search for AGN associated to galaxies in the most massive, highest SFR density protocluster known, SPT2349-59 at z=4.31. The AGN are likley to be dusty and while not unique identifiers sub-mm lines efficiently povide access to the entire AGN census. We will use deep ALMA observations of the protocluster in CO(14-13), CO(11-10) and CO(7-6) to provide high-J through mid-J CO lines for comprahensive SLED analysis of composite PDR+XDR models in combination with CO (4-3) and CO (2-1) data already avalible. The SPT2349 protocluster shows at least 12 sources with weak C+/FIR ratios, a possible signature of AGN-dominated emission, and many AGN are likely in the protocluster system. We will address what powers the bright ALMA protocluster sources, whether SMBHs are triggered by dense environments, and whether mergers trigger AGN and SF activity.',\n"," 'Dense Gas Tracers, Star Formation, Cloud Properties, and Galaxy Structure in Five Nearby Spiral Galaxies. We propose to use ALMA to measure the emission from high critical density transitions in Band 3 (``dense gas tracers) from the inner 3-5 kpc of five nearby star forming galaxies. With these observations, we will double the sample of galaxies where we measure the environmental dependence of the dense gas fraction (traced by HCN/CO or HCO+/CO) and the apparent ability of dense gas to form stars (e.g., SFR/HCN) on environment. So far, a strong environmental dependence of is observed, but with large galaxy-to-galaxy variation and limited statistical significance. This proposal will at last give us 6-12 independent measurements per 0.1 dex bin in stellar surface density, ISM pressure, and gas depletion time. Only ALMA can simultaneously resolve the inner part of the galaxies into discrete environments and achieve the sensitivity needed to detect these lines. We choose our targets to overlap existing high resolution CO imaging and a wide-field single dish survey. This will allow us to test how density-sensitive line ratios (e.g., HCN/CO) depend on the local properties of molecular clouds and so connect the density distribution from the galaxy to cloud to microscopic scales.',\n"," 'Revealing the Debris Distribution in Two Rocky Planet Forming Disks. We propose high angular resolution ALMA maps to reveal the debris distribution in two young debris disks where significant disk variability and optical eclipsing events, likely due to the aftermath of large asteroid impacts, are observed. The ALMA images will provide crucial disk geometric information and constrain disk scale height and any asymmetric sub-structure in the disks. The proposed observations will also determine the gas content by sensitive CO measurements, and assess the dynamical and evolutionary state of these two rocky planet forming disks.',\n"," 'A CO census of high-redshift submillimetre galaxies in ECDFS. Observations of redshifted CO in distant sub-mm selected galaxies (SMGs) probe the physical conditions in which new stars form. When CO is collisionally de-excited from the Jth to the J-1th rotational energy level, the result is a photon whose frequency is J*115GHz. The ground-state CO(1-0) line is perhaps the most direct tracer of the total molecular gas mass in galaxies, via the alpha_CO conversion factor. However 1-0 is observationally expensive to obtain, and thus most molecular gas surveys target higher-J lines (e.g. 3-2), which are brighter and redshifted to more favourable atmospheric windows. Such surveys must be down-converted to 1-0 via an assumed CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) in order to measure total gas masses. No such template yet exists in SMGs, and as a result template SLEDs from low-redshift ULIRGs are often used, introducing large uncertainties in the derived properties of SMGs. This survey aims to conduct the first reliable CO SLED survey, using a sample of unlensed SMGs which benefits from the foundational bedrock of 1-0 data. Our aim is to construct the template SLEDs by which future observations of the ISM in high-z galaxies will be interpreted.',\n"," 'Challenging the paradigm? The environment of the first supermassive black holes in the Universe. The current paradigm to explain the formation and early growth of the first supermassive black holes postulates that their seeds (and thus, the first quasars) reside in some of the most pronounced matter and galaxy overdensities in the early universe. However, despite monumental investments (hundreds of hours with 8-10m class telescopes), optical/NIR observations have so far failed to provide conclusive evidence in support of this scenario. Only very recently unambiguous evidence of galaxies that are associated with the immediate environment (<100 kpc) of z>6 quasars is appearing, thanks in particular to ALMA [CII] observations. Here we propose to circumvent the limitations of the small field of view of ALMA by capitalizing on a synergy with SCUBA sub-mm observations of quasar fields in which small-scale overdensities have been reported. If we confirm that a conspicuous fraction of the bright SCUBA-detected galaxies are indeed at the redshift of the quasars, we will have first robust evidence of the first massive large-scale overdensities in the universe. In case of a negative result, our observations will strongly shake the current paradigm of massive black hole formation.',\n"," 'Dissecting molecular tori of Seyfert galaxies. The long-sought images obtained by ALMA of the many faces of the >10pc-size molecular torus in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068 have revolutionized the canonical pc-scale torus paradigm of unified AGN theories. The NGC1068 torus is lopsided and shows a surprisingly complex kinematics. This proposal aims at imaging with unprecedented resolution the 10-to-40 pc size molecular tori recently identified in 7 nearby Seyferts, which are part of our ongoing ALMA survey (GATOS). We propose to map the CO(3-2) and the HCO+(4-3) lines and their underlying continuum emission in the circumnuclear disks (CND) of the 7 GATOS targets for which we already have images obtained at 0.1\"(7-13pc) using now a spatial resolution of 0.02-0.03\"(2-3pc). This project will expand by an order of magnitude the number of AGNs observed with a spatial resolution and sensitivity similar to those achieved in NGC1068. These observations will allow to build 3D morpho-kinematic models of the torus, disentangling Keplerian rotation from inflow and outflow motions, derive BH mass estimates, and map the torus-CND connections to establish the current feeding budget in a representative sample of nearby AGNs.',\n"," 'Exploring the Cosmic Origins of Chiral Molecules. We have recently reported the first detection of a chiral molecule in the interstellar medium, toward Sgr B2(N) (McGuire & Carroll 2016). Chiral molecules represent a critical class of organic species that drive biology. The cosmic origin of these species is proposed to have its origins in cometary and asteroidal material. Our initial detection of propylene oxide was in the cold outer envelope of Sgr B2, however it is not clear how representative this population is of the more evolved hot core chemistry, which seeds planetesimal inventories, and the detection lacks any information on spatial distribution. Here, we propose observations of the strongest propylene oxide transitions toward the hot cores of Sgr B2(N) to map the distribution and excitation of this key molecule in this source, and determine under what conditions it might be incorporated into icy material in pre-solar envrionments.',\n"," 'Imaging massive binary black hole candidate Oj287 with the GMVA+ALMA. We propose 3 mm GMVA+ALMA observations of OJ287, one of the best candidates for hosting a sub-pc supermassive binary black hole system (SMBBH) and to study jet formation. The improvement in the north-south resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA, and the comparison with quasi-simultaneous, resolution-matched 1 mm EHT+ALMA images could potentially spatially resolve the binary system, providing the first confirmation of sub-pc SMBBHs, prime targets for nano- and milli-hertz gravitational wave detectors. Comparison with similar campaigns in 2017, 2018, and 2019 will allow us to measure the innermost jet swing during a time period that covers already ~30% of the SMBBH orbit, providing stronger constrains on the applicability of the SMBBH model. Our continued observing campaign will also allow us, for the first time, to study the magnetic field and particle energy distribution evolution at scales not probed before in blazar jets, reaching linear scales of only ~50 Schwarzschild radii in OJ287. This will be used to test the applicability of magnetically driven jet formation models and the SMBBH scenario by comparing predictions from different GRMHD simulations.',\n"," 'Are Close Binaries Formed through Disk Fragmentation?. Over 50% of sun-like stars are found in binary/multiple systems. Their formation is thought to occur during the early stages of the star formation process, but the formation mechanism remains unclear. The most likely possibilities are either disk fragmentation or turbulent fragmentation with dynamical evolution. To understand protostellar multiplicity, we have conducted a VLA 8 mm survey of all protostars (N~80) in the Perseus molecular cloud (d=230 pc) at a resolution of 0.3\" (70 AU). With this unprecedented survey, we identified 17 close proto-binary systems with separations less than 500 AU, and of these, 14 are new discoveries. While these detections are significant, the VLA data do not convey their formation mechanism. Therefore, we propose to use ALMA to observe dust continuum and molecular line emission (C18O, 13CO) toward these 17 sources to determine if these sources have circumbinary disks in the apparent dust continuum and we will use the molecular line maps to determine if the disks are rotationally-supported. This sample is large enough to reveal general trends as to whether or not binaries typically form via disk fragmentation or turbulent fragmentation.',\n"," 'Black hole mass measurements in the most MASSIVE Galaxies. Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs), as the end point of galaxy evolution, are the subject of intense interest. Yet, their complex formation histories remain obscure. In lower-mass objects black holes (BHs) are strongly correlated with properties of the stellar bulge implying co-evolution between the BH and stellar components. The BH mass in massive ETGs, however, does not correlate well with galaxy parameters. The most massive galaxies and their central BHs therefore may have followed different evolutionary paths from their less-massive counterparts. We propose to observe the molecular discs that lie in the heart of four of the most massive molecular gas hosting early-type galaxies in the local universe, in order to estimate their SMBH masses. With these observations we can test the feedback paradigm, constrain the environmental dependance of SMBH-host galaxy relations, provide important cross-checks on SMBH mass measurement techniques and anchor studies of the SMBH - host galaxy relations which use molecular gas. In this way a short investment of ALMA time can help reveal more about the complex formation histories of the most massive galaxies in our universe.',\n"," 'Unveiling Short GRB Millimeter Afterglows with ALMA. Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are relativistic explosions which originate from the mergers of two compact objects (NS-NS/NS-BH). Such merging systems are also at the forefront of transient astrophysics, with the recent multi-messenger discovery of GW170817. Modeling of SGRB afterglow emission from the radio to X-ray bands provides a unique way to probe the burst basic explosion properties: the energy scales, circumburst densities, and jet opening angles. These properties not only provide critical insight into merger environments, but also serve as a vital baseline for comparison to properties inferred from future gravitational wave events. In the millimeter band, the faint and rapidly-fading afterglows of SGRBs require the sensitivity and dynamic scheduling of ALMA. Here, we propose to use ALMA TOO observations to identify and monitor, or place deep limits on the millimeter afterglows of 2 SGRBs in Cycle 9. Our proposed observations will be sensitive to SGRBs over a wide range of densities and jet opening angles. Our search will continue ALMAs newfound role in SGRB millimeter studies, and will offer hundred-fold improvement over previous millimeter searches with other facilities.',\n"," 'Probing non-uniform dust production rate in a young debris disk. Debris disks are the natural by-products of the star and planet formation processes. They consist of small dust grains released in a collisional cascade from larger planetesimals. From an observational point of view, we know very little about this process that is producing significant amount of small dust grains. Currently, the best way to study the grain size distribution is to constrain the spectral slope at millimeter wavelengths. We propose here a pilot study to derive a spatially resolved map of the slope of the grain size distribution in the young debris disk around HD181327. This disk has been spatially resolved on multiple occasions, with several instruments, and we think it is the best candidate for such a pioneering study. Based on HST observations, there are hints that a massive collision of planetesimals took place on one side of the disk, which should locally increase the dust production rate. We propose Band 3 observations to supplement exisitng archival Band 6 observations and constrain the collisional activity in the 23 Myr old debris disk.',\n"," 'Polarization of SNR 1987A: probing the shock structure and the compact remnant. Polarization of the synchrotron emission from supernova remnants (SNRs) gives insight into the mag- netic field properties, particle acceleration mechanisms at the shock front, asymmetry, and evolution of the compact remnant. Supernova (SN) 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud, the brightest SN in 400 years, is a unique laboratory to investigate polarized emission generated by the elusive compact remnant and by the shock front. Polarization is critical to accurately locate a possible pulsar wind nebula, and to correlate the degree of efficiency of the particle acceleration process with the topology of the magnetic field. ALMA Cycle 4 Full Polarization observations, with resolution of 10% of the remnant size, provide the opportunity to detect polarized emission in SNR 1987A for the first time.',\n"," 'The hybrid disk phenomenon over the stellar mass range. Based on ALMA observations, our group recently identified a new class of young (10-50 Myr) circumstellar disks that exhibit debris disk-like dust properties but have large amounts of CO gas of primordial origin. These \"hybrid disks\" may be the missing links between the protoplanetary and debris disk phases. So far, hybrid disks are only found around A-type stars. Our proposal has two main goals: (1) use CO isotopologue observations to decide on the hybrid nature of two known CO-bearing debris disks around A-type stars; and (2) look for gas in ten massive debris disks around F-M-type members of nearby young moving groups. By combining our results with previous ALMA data, we will have an almost complete survey of young debris disks with high fractional luminosity within 150 pc covering the A-M spectral type range. This will allow us to determine how the incidence of hybrid disks varies over the stellar mass range of 0.5-3 solar masses. If we find that hybrid disks are exclusive to A-type stars, this would imply that these stars can retain their primordial gas much longer, allowing significantly more time, e.g., for the in situ formation of wide separation Uranus-like planets.',\n"," 'A Deeper Look into the Life Cycle of the Molecular Gas in the Nearest Nuclear Starburst: GMCs, Molecular Superwind, and Feedback. We propose to complement our ALMA cycle 0 observations of NGC253, the nearest nuclear starburst, with new observations including ACA+TP. These new ALMA capabilities in cycle 1 will allow us an unprecently deep look at the outflowing molecular gas. Our cycle 0 CO observations (released to us in late April, recalibrated, and reimaged) show a groundbreaking picture of molecular gas entrainment in a superwind. In them we are able to identify expanding shell structures in the starburst unequivocally associated with high-velocity molecular gas tendrils (Figs. 2 and 3). We are hampered, however, by the lack of short spacings and total power measurements in the cycle 0 observations. This limitation means that we only recover a fraction of the CO luminosity, making it impossible to correctly estimate the mass and energetics of the molecular outflow. That is our goal for cycle 1. With a modest investment of ALMA band 3 we will be able to recover flux in all scales, and measure two a parameter fundamentally related to the evolution of starbursts: the mass, energetics, and ejection mechanism of the molecular gas entrained in the galactic superwind, thought to be the main way to quench massive starbursts. Because we have not yet received the extended configuration observations of dense gas that constitute part of our cycle 0 data, and since projects are not carried from one cycle to the next, we add that request to this proposal. Those observations will allow us to measure the properties of Giant Molecular clouds, thought to drive the high star formation efficiencies in a starburst. They will also provide high resolution data on the aforementioned expanding shell structures.',\n"," 'Small-Scale Substructures in Protoplanetary Disks. We propose a Large Program designed to characterize substructures (e.g., gaps, rings, spirals, clumps, etc.) in the spatial distributions of solid particles for a well-defined sample of 20 nearby classical (i.e., not transitional) protoplanetary disks, using very high spatial resolution (down to ~6 AU scales) ALMA Band 6 (240 GHz) continuum observations. This survey will be the first to resolve material well into the planet-forming zones of disks with a uniform sensitivity and resolution (in to a radius of ~3 AU). In doing so, it will provide a homogenized look at the small-scale features that directly trace the planet formation process, quantifying their prevalence, variety of form, spatial scales, spacings, symmetry, and amplitudes, for targets with a diverse range of global disk structures and stellar host properties. Having access to that information will be transformative to the field: it will fundamentally shape our understanding of how planet formation is aided by -- and perhaps reliant on -- disk substructures, and it will provide essential context for the proper interpretation of all disk observations at coarser resolutions. Only ALMA can realize these goals.',\n"," 'Chemistry in the Brightest Face-On Starburst Galaxy. M 83 is the best ALMA target to study spatially-resolved chemistry in the nuclear region of a starburst galaxy. This is because of its proximity, face-on configuration and brightness. It has been proposed from near infrared/optical/UV observations that the gas flowing through the bar into the circumnuclear ring can induce active star formation.This creates an age gradient of stars along the circumnuclear ring. We propose to observe molecular tracers to examine whether chemical composition along the circum-nuclear ring can be used to probe such a time difference in star formation.In several frequency settings in Band 3, 6, and 7, we will map molecular tracers of shocks, photon-dominated regions, dense cores, at the GMC-scale. Our chemical diagnostics can reveal the star formation sequence even in regions of high obscuration where light at other wavelengths cannot convey the information. This dataset will also serve as a chemical template in the circumnuclear ring of a starburst galaxy with much better spatial information, sensitivity, and chemical complexity than previous studies.',\n"," 'Exploring the pulsar spectra in the sub-mm with ALMA. Studying pulsar spectra is key to understand the physics of the emission processes in their magnetospheres and the behaviour of relativistic particles and radiation under extreme magnetic field conditions.The harvest of pulsar detections in gamma-rays by Fermi (~160) has triggered follow-up multi-wavelength observations,mainly in the X rays and in the optical,and made extensive studies of the pulsar spectra possible for the first time.To set the complete picture,however, expanding the observations to other wavelengths is crucial.Indeed, only a handful of pulsars are detected all the way from the gamma-rays to the radio, owing to the lack of sensitive observations at low-energies.In particular,no pulsar has been observed so far in the sub-mm, a crucial wavelength range to investigate the transition between coherent and incoherent radiation emission processes, occurring between high radio frequencies and the infrared.We propose to use ALMA to search for sub-mm emission from the Vela pulsar,a well-known gamma,X-ray,and optical pulsar.Being one of the very few detected in both the near and mid-IR,Vela is an obvious candidate to be the first pulsar ever detected in the sub-mm with ALMA.',\n"," 'Search for Inner Disk in Transitional Disks. Transitional disks are protoplanetary disks having an inner cavity and are important targets to study disk evolution and planet formation. Recently, we have discovered an inner subdisk with the radius of 4 AU within the cavity of the disk around DM Tau. This discovery poses a question of the distinction of the pre-transitional (disks with near infrared excess) and transitional disks (those without near infrared excess). These two populations are classified according to SED, but the inner disk structures may have a continuous distribution of various inner disk radii. Based on this discovery, we propose to conduct a small discovery survey to find an inner disk structures of 6 known transitional disk objects by deep, high resolution observations at Band 6. Targets are carefully selected from existing ALMA archival data. The inner disk at several AU from the central star cannot be probed by near infrared excess nor low resolution (~0.15 asec beam) observations. ALMA high resolution observations is the only way to probe directly such structures in a \"planet forming\" region, whose distance from the central star is similar to that of our Solar System planets from the Sun.',\n"," 'The origin of high-mass star-forming regions: role of filaments and global collapse. Virtually all star-forming regions show filamentary structures. Whether these filaments are coherent, monolithic structures that connect multiple star-forming regions, or are composed of multiple subunits is presently poorly known, as is the answer to the fundamental question regarding their role in accumulating mass in the sites of active star formation. We select precursors of high-mass star-forming regions hosted in isolated filaments, to address these issues: the best 6 candidates were identified out of the complete ATLASGAL catalogue of 10000 sources. We propose to observe the spine of these filaments and its surroundings with the ACA to map their velocity field, looking for ordered mass flows and signs of large/scale infall. The large-scale kinematics around these objects is still undisturbed, reflecting the initial conditions of high-mass star formation. Competing theories of star formation predict a different contribution from the environment in terms of gas accreted onto massive clumps, allowing the proposed observations to distinguish between them.',\n"," 'Planetary Nebulae genesis: emerging HII regions around post-AGB stars.. Based on the exciting results from our pilot search for radio recombination lines (RRLs) in a small sample of pPNe, we propose to map with ALMA (0.03-0.08\"-resolution) the emerging ionized cores of three representative objects. RRLs at mm-wavelengths are unique probes of the dense inner and heavily obscured regions of pPNe, where the yet unknown agents for PN-shaping operate. Typically, mm-RRLs have intensities and line-to-continuum flux ratios larger than cm-RRLs and, thus, are more easily detectable. Most importantly, cm-RRLs trace of the relatively tenuous environments of evolved and well developed PNe but NOT the dense inner winds of pPNe. The proposed observations will certainly produce significant new insights into the physical conditions, structure, and dynamics of the, up to date inscrutable, inner regions of pPNe. This is a resubmission of proposal 2016.1.00161.S, which was included in the Cycle 4 observing queue with priority C. This program has been partially observed (CRL618 at 1mm with ~0.2arcsec) but unlikely to be finished in clycle 4. Should this project be finished in cycle 4, this proposal will be withdrawn.',\n"," 'Dynamically Fingerprinting HD141569s Protoplanetary Disk: A Testbed For Planet Formation and Disk Evolution Theories. We propose to observe the dynamic protoplanetary disk surrounding HD141569 to test models for the origins of debris disk structures and to place strong constraints on planet formation on wide orbits. HD141569 has a complex radial and aximuthal morphology at opitical wavelenghts, contains gas as well as debris, and appears to be in the final throes of planet formaiton. The system is in a rare stage, transitioning from gas to debris dominated, making the system a unique testbed for planet formation and disk evolution theories.',\n"," 'A Unique View of 2I/Borisov: an ISO in Large Particles. The Interstellar Objects (ISO) passing through our Solar System offer a rare opportunity to probe the physical and chemical processes involved in solid body and planet formation in extrasolar systems. While observations of the first ISO, 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) led to constraints on its outgassing from dynamical modeling, no direct detection of the ejected material was made. Here, we propose to characterize the newly discovered second ISO, 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov), (MPEC R106). Unlike 1I/Oumuamua , 2I/ Borisov has shown evidence of cometary activity, meaning that investigations of the mass-loss is possible for this object. Our goal is to map the thermal continuum from 2I/Borisov over four ALMA bands, 3, 4, 6 and 7, so as to measure the dust mass and place constraints on its particle size distribution. The ALMA observations will complement our ESO observing campaign to yield strong constraints on the mass-dominant millimeter-sized or larger particles in the coma of 2I/Borisov. The superb sensitivity of ALMA provides the only way to study large particles of the second ISO in unprecedented detail.',\n"," 'Sub-kpc Imaging of the Star-forming Gas in two [C II] luminous Quasar Host Galaxies at z ~ 6. We propose ALMA subkpc resolution imaging of the [CII] line and dust continuum emission from two of the most [CII] luminous quasars - ULAS J1319+0950 at z=6.13 and SDSS J2310+1855 at z=6.00. We also ask for subkpc imaging of the CO(9-8) line emission from SDSS J2310+1855. Our previous 0.3\"~0.6\" resolution [CII] images of the two objects reveal intense star formation from a rotating gas disk extended over a scale of a few kpc. The sub-kpc scale imaging proposed here will allow us to well resolve the disk and model the rotation velocity and inclination angle at different radii in details, address if there is any warped geometry, substructures or tidal features that might be the residual of recent galaxy merger. It will also separate the extended star-forming heated dust component from the compact (<1kpc) AGN-heated dust. Our recent CO (9-8) and (8-7) line detections in J2310+1855 suggest a highly-excited component which may be powered by the central AGN. These very high-J CO lines are more compact and show a different velocity field compared to that traced by the [CII] line. Thus the CO(9-8) line imaging proposed here is unique to probe the AGN feedback effects on gas dynamics.',\n"," 'Looking for a Keplerian disk in the very young protostar IRAS 4A. Circumstellar disks are essential to star formation. In the youngest protostars, Class 0 objects, magnetic fields can hinder disk growth if they are aligned with the rotation axis of the system. However, if the two are misaligned, then a large disk can grow. Current polarization observations are starting to probe magnetic fields down to disk (~50 AU) size scales. IRAS 4A is a unique Class 0 protostar in the sense that it is very young (~10 kyr), very bright, and very polarized (~15% at 8 mm). We postulate that the inferred magnetic field morphology seen at 8 mm by the VLA is indicative of rotating circumstellar material around the protostar. To confirm Keplerian motion, kinematic observations are needed. High resolution ALMA polarization observations of C17O and C18O, as well as the polarized dust continuum at 3 mm will allow us to both gather the kinematic information of the system, as well as make a useful comparison of the inferred magnetic field at 3 mm to that at 8 mm.',\n"," 'Solving the mystery of star formation without cold gas. This proposal is designed to address a major issue in understanding the ISM properties of low-metallicity starburst galaxies: the lack of molecular gas despite active star formation. Indeed, the molecular gas reservoir is difficult to measure at low metallicity as CO is more prone to photodissociation by hard radiation fields than H2. With vigorous star formation, bright far-infrared lines (including [CII] from our Herschel survey), but little detected HI and CO, the low-metallicity starburst galaxy Haro11 stands as a clear outlier from the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. Known as a local analogue of Lyman break galaxies, it serves as the template for high-redshift galaxies and it is the best case to study the gas-star formation cycle under such extreme conditions. We propose band 3, 6, and 7 observations of the CO lines to localize the cold, star-forming gas in Haro11 at 1\" resolution, probe spatially the gas excitation and physical conditions (densities, filling factors, optical depth, etc.), and determine accurately its total molecular gas reservoir.',\n"," 'DEATH STAR: DEtermining Accurate mass-loss rates of THermally pulsing AGB STARs. Mass loss by a stellar wind is a decisive process for late stellar evolution. Through this wind, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are major contributors of synthesized elements and dust to their surroundings. The wind process is studied using dynamical wind models with the goal of developing a predictive theory of AGB mass loss crucial for stellar and galactic evolution. The most reliable method to measure mass-loss rates, and to provide constraints for the wind models, is through CO line observations, but further progress in this fundamental field is still limited by the large observational uncertainties, where the assumed size of the CO envelope is a major factor. To solve this problem we propose to directly measure the CO envelope sizes for a representative sample of typical AGB stars by observing the CO(2-1) and (3-2) emission using the ACA in stand-alone mode. With this data we will develop the most accurate description of AGB mass loss, needed over a large range of wind properties, uniquely determine the gas-to-dust ratios of the sources, and through the
