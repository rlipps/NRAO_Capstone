We propose a Large Program to perform unbiased line surveys in the 279 to 312 GHz frequency range of 11 nearby Solar-type protostars. The targeted protostars are known hosts of complex organic molecules and sample different natal environments and evolutionary stages. The proposed spectral coverage will allow us to unambiguously identify complex organic molecules and their isotopologues and to accurately derive the abundances for species with abundances down to 0.01% relative to methanol. The concerted effort will provide a deep understanding of the complex organic inventories and isotopic ratios depending on the physical environment and evolutionary past.

A growing number of debris disks are found to contain gas, but the origin and evolution of this gas is not well understood. We propose to acquire ALMA data of CI emission towards seven debris disks. By combining our observations with archival data, we will get a complete census of the C and CO gas content of a volume-limited sample of bright debris disks around young A-stars. This will allow us to study the relation between C, CO and the dust on a statistical level for the first time. By comparing the fluxes and spatial distributions of C, CO and the dust, we will test models of secondary gas production, viscous evolution and chemistry of gaseous debris disks. Our survey will provide new insights into the early evolution of planetary systems and help to bridge the gap between protoplanetary disks and mature planetary systems such as the Solar System.',\n"," 'Resolving GMC Scales and Clumpy Galaxy Formation in the Most Massive Halo in the Reionization Era. We propose to image the dust and CII emission in the central galaxies of the most massive halo known in the epoch of reionization at the highest possible spatial resolutions with ALMA, SPT0311-58 at z=6.900. This target is the only z>6 system bright enough to push to 15km baselines, and is the target of multiple JWST Cycle 1 imaging and IFU programs and deep HST imaging. The structure is anchored by a pair of ultramassive merging galaxies resolved into a chaotic and clumpy rapidly-assembling structure in existing ~0.08\" dust and CII ALMA data. The proposed 0.02\" observations will resolve the size and mass scales of Giant Molecular Clouds seen at lower redshift. We will determine whether any of the currently-known CII clumps breaks up into smaller substructures at <100pc resolution, constrain the internal kinematics of the clumps to determine their origins, and connect the clumps to z=0 GMCs. SPT0311-58 is the only reionization-era target for which such high spatial resolution is feasible, and will illuminate the formation of early massive galaxies on GMC scales in unmatched detail.',\n"," 'The chaotic formation of a massive galaxy at z=6.6. High redshift quasars are thought to be hosted by massive and luminous galaxies. One of the most stunning examples is the bright quasar host J0305-3150 at z=6.6. Our ALMA Cycle 1 and 2 observations of the [CII], CO(6-5) and CO(7-6) lines and the underlying continuum revealed a luminous source with a very high star-formation rate and a massive cold gas reservoir. High-resolution (~0.2, 1kpc) follow-up of the [CII] line and the underlying continuum in Cycle 3 revealed a spectacular morphology of the ISM, with kinematics inconsistent with simple rotation. The brightness of the CO lines (observable in one setup) now allows us to resolve the kinematics/morphology of the molecular gas in this quasar. This will be the first spatially resolved CO/H2 map of a z>6.5 galaxy. The comparison of the [CII] and CO kinematics and morphologies will provide spatially resolved constraints on the characteristics of the ISM (densities, radiation field) of this unique system. We also propose to push the resolution of the [CII]/dust setup further, to an unprecedented 0.05\" (or 250pc) to finally resolve the bright continuum emission that is coincident with the central accreting supermassive black hole.',\n"," 'The properties of compact-object mergers detected by LIGO and VIRGO. With the discovery of the binary neutron star merger gravitational-wave (GW) source GW170817, and its electromagnetic counterpart, the era of GW+EM multi-messenger astronomy has truly begun. The combined power of the LIGO and the VIRGO GW detectors led to a rapid localisation in the range of several dozen square degrees, combined with the distance information as a third dimension. This allowed the discovery of a kilonova (KN) associated with the merger event, and thereby a precise localisation and distance measurement. While the optical emission traces the radioactive merger ejecta powering the KN, emission in the radio domain traces relativistic ejecta associated with the accompanying gamma-ray burst (GRB). We propose to follow up compact-object mergers with ALMA. Our goals are to 1) determine the range of electromagnetic properties seen in compact-object mergers, 2) establish how properties of the electromagnetic counterparts depend on the system parameters and viewing angle, which can also be important to break degeneracies in the GW analysis, 3) measure the structure of jets to demonstrate how mergers create short GRBs, and 4) study the environment of the GW source.',\n"," 'The kpc-scale view to the molecular gas content in `typical star-forming galaxies at z~1.5. Sensitive measurements of the CO(2-1) emission line in high-z galaxies at ~kpc-scale are now possible with ALMA. We propose to complement our recently obtained spatially-resolved observations of the CO(2-1) emission for `main-sequencestar-forming galaxies at z~1.5. We already have CO(2-1) unresolved data for the three targets proposed to be observed in this project. These sources are also already observed in Halpha emission from KMOS (KGES survey). This data will guarantee the \"success\" of our proposed observations in order to put UDS_96844, CDFS_31127 and UDS_124101 in the global context of galaxy evolution. We will be able to perform a spatially-resolved view of the star formation activity, gas dynamics. We will be able to compare the ionized and molecular gas ISM morphologies and dynamics. By comparing the molecular gas masses for these systems with their dynamical masses inferred from two-dimensional kinematic model, we will be able to give upper limits to the CO-to-H2 conversion value in the central parts of typical star-forming galaxies at high-z. The kinematic modelling will also help us to constrain the dark-matter content in the galaxy outkirts.',\n"," 'Unveiling the Early Stages of Massive Binary Formation with JWST. Most of massive stars are born in binary systems, therefore understanding massive binary formation is crucial for understanding massive star formation in general. Observational studies of massive forming binaries in the embedded phase are still very limited. JWST provides a new, unique window to study such systems. We propose JWST/NIRCam observations of two forming massive binaries, which are the closest-separation embedded-phase massive forming binaries identified to date. We aim to: 1) directly image the massive binaries utilizing the high resolution and sensitivity of JWST, and characterize the stellar properties and accretion status of individual members in these systems; 2) map the extended emissions of the outflow cavities, to determine the cavity geometries and heated dust distributions, especially in the innermost regions. 3) probe the low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) forming along with the massive binaries. To achive the last goal, we also propose joint ALMA observation in 0.85 mm, to significantly improve the detection sensitivities of cold dust structures of the YSOs to achieve of a complete census of the low-mass YSO populations around these massive binaries.',\n"," 'A new hot, diffuse molecular component in the nuclear bulge of the Milky Way. Until recently, our view of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the innermost few 100 pc) of the Milky Way was that it consists of basically two phases: dense and warm molecular Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) and a thin, hot and highly ionized component that fills the remaining volume. It was thought that this view can also be applied to the central regions of many other galaxies. Recently, however, Geballe & Oka (2010) detected widespread and broad (100-200 km/s) H3+ and CO infrared absorption toward point sources sources in the CMZ, which they claimed to represent a diffuse molecular medium which is widespread in the CMZ and which can be characterized by low densities and high temperatures (e.g. <100 cm-3, 300K). Although the absorption seems to be ubiquitous for CMZ clouds, little is known about the volume filling factor, mass, the detailed excitation conditions (n(H2), T_kin) and chemical composition. It has not yet been studied, to our knowledge, in microwave or mm molecular transitions, although it might be similar to a component seen in absorption toward a high z quasar arising from an intervening galaxy. We propose a pilot project to look for mm absorption lines toward a quasar close to the direction of the galactic center in order to confirm and characterize this new phase.',\n"," 'Star formation in the 1000 km/s shock of Stephans Quintet. The Stephans Quintet group of galaxies is one of these must-do targets revealing surprises each time being looked at by a new instrument. The most striking feature is a giant intergalactic shock created by a 1000km/s galaxy collision, with very low star formation despite an amount of warm molecular hydrogen comparable to the molecular content of the Milky Way. Our Herschel [CII] and IRAM 30m CO(1-0) measurements show that the gas kinematics are complex (FWHM=1000 km/s) on large scales (10 kpc). PdBI CO(1-0) observations reveal molecular complexes of 2-5kpc in size, but with star formation efficiencies varying by a factor of 20. Why? We propose to map the CO(2-1) and SiO(2-1) emission at spatial resolution of 0.3\", comparable to the size of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), to measure the gas turbulence on scales where gravitationally bound clouds may form, and identify whether the star-forming regions in the shock are the sites of dissipation of kinetic energy through molecular shocks. These ALMA observations will characterize the role of the energy cascade, from bulk motions to turbulent motions on GMC scales, on the regulation of star formation in extremely turbulent environments.',\n"," 'Star-formation rates for a complete sample of AGN host galaxies. Models of galaxy formation predict that nuclear activity (i.e., AGNs) has played a key role in regulating the star-formation in massive galaxies. However, conclusive evidence of this has yet to emerge from observations, with recent results from far-infrared (FIR) and sub-mm campaigns finding both enhanced and depressed star-formation rates (SFRs) in the host galaxies of powerful AGN. Such conflicting results are heavily based on stacking non-detections which currently account for the majority of AGNs in even the deepest FIR/sub-mm observations. To remove the inherent uncertainties associated with stacking analysese requires far more numbers of individually detected AGNs at FIR/sub-mm wavelengths. The ALMA observations proposed here will be sensitive to SFRs 3-7 times lower than that achieved by Herschel for a complete (at M* 5 × 10^10 M⊙ and z > 1.5) sample of X-ray detected AGNs, reaching the divide between star-forming and quiescent (in terms of star-formarion) for each. These observations will allow us to measure SFRs for a complete sample of star-forming AGN hosts and to quantify the number of quiescent hosts as a function of AGN power and redshift.',\n"," 'Origin of warm water emission in low-mass protostars. Water plays an important role throughout the entire star formation process, from cores to disks. In the cold dense outer parts of the protostellar envelope, water is the main constituent of the icy grain mantles. When the grains are heated above 100 K, water is released into the gas phase. Previously, we successfully observed warm water towards four deeply-embedded (Class 0) low-mass protostars. The observations show compact, narrow warm water lines on scales <100 AU, but its origin remains elusive (hot core, disks, or shocks). To determine the location of the warm water emission, we propose to observe the two isotopologues HDO and H2-18O in band 6 and 8 towards four sources that are more evolved (Class I) to further investigate and constrain the origin of the warm water emission and how this is affected by the evolution of the protostellar system. The observations will be able to, for the first time, constrain the location and abundance of warm water vapor in these objects.',\n"," 'On the nature of 3mm-selected sources: the highest redshift dusty star-forming galaxies?. At z>4, the largest submm/mm surveys are only sensitive to the most extreme dusty star-forming galaxies (SFR>1000 M_sun/yr). Less extreme sources can be detected in the deepest single-dish telescope surveys, however, the identified population of DSFGs are overwhelmed by the more abundant low-z population (not to mention their large positional uncertainties). Recent deep pencil-beam surveys from ALMA have also failed to detect high-z sources. We have analyzed, for the first time, the potential of 3mm observations to detect high-z DSFGs. This wavelength naturally filters out z<2 galaxies due to a very negative K-correction. We find 14 serendipitously-detected 3mm sources within ~160 sq. arcmin of ALMA archival observations. Three of them already have spectroscopic redshifts (z=2.5-4.5), which confirms their high-z nature. Here, we request 19h of observations (including overheads) to conduct a blind redshift survey for the remaining sources using an optimized band 3 + band 4 spectral setup. This work will reveal the nature of 3mm galaxies and their contribution to the cosmic star formation rate density, and will costrain the infrared galaxy luminosity function at high-z.',\n"," 'Gas Dissipation in Protoplanetary Disks at the Final Stage of Disk Evolution. We propose to investigate the final stage of protoplanetary disk evolution with ALMA. Our tagets (PDS~70, RX~J1604.3$-$2130, IRAS~04125$+$2902, and Sz~91) are weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTS) that have so-called {\\\\it transitional disks}. The large cavities ($r>$20 ~AU) in the central disk-region around these four objects have been imaged at both (sub-)mm and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, and this imagery suggests the large-mm-size and small-sub-$\\\\mu$m-size dust grains are dissipated inside the cavity. Among the many transitional disks that have been discovered around classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), these four WTTS systems are likely to be more evolved and close to the epoch of their final stage of disk evolution. We propose to use Band~6 observations at a maximum spatial resolution of 0.$$18 to measure the amount of gas inside the cavity, in order to obtain observational evidence of gas-decreasing in transitional disks around WTTS.',\n"," 'Solar prominences under the hood: viewing the thermal structure of prominences for the first time with ALMA. Prominences are one of the most dramatic illustrations of how the magnetic field shapes the atmosphere of a star: the magnetic field somehow supports a cool, dense plasma in a hot, tenuous environment. In our solar system, prominences constitute the best example of natural plasma confinement. Prominences sometimes erupt, throwing vast amounts of magnetized plasma in the heliosphere, often in association with flares and coronal mass ejections. Understanding the formation of prominences and their temporal evolution is of the utmost importance for our understanding of mass loading in the corona, and of the interplay between plasma and magnetic field in stellar coronae. The observation with ALMA at high spatial resolution of solar prominences in two frequency bands will offer for the first time a detailed view of prominence fine structures at mm wavelengths. The measured brightness temperatures in Band 3 and Band 6 will unravel the internal temperature structure of the emitting plasma. These measurements will provide key constraints urgently needed by theoretical models addressing the central question of the energy balance of the prominence plasma within the hot solar corona.',\n"," 'Identifying the mysterious radio source close to the optical position of the short GRB 050709. In the current paradigm short GRBs are produced by the merger of two compact objects, two neutron stars (NSs) or a NS and a black hole, after an evolutionary phase of inspiral that can last for billions of years. However, some population synthesis models also predict merging compact objects at much younger ages which should be hosted in star-forming galaxies. If some short-GRB progenitors are members of a young stellar population, they should explode close to their natal star-forming regions. Recently, based on ATCA 5.5 GHz observations we found a radio source close to the optical position of the 10 yr-old short GRB 050709. Within the astrometric uncertainty, the position of this source coincides with the position of the GRB. The data suggest that it is a star-forming region. Here we propose to use ALMA to search for the expected counterpart of this source in band 6 and 9. If it is a star-forming region then we should detect it. If we do not detect it then there is an excess of 5.5~GHz flux, which would imply that a different radiation mechanism is at work that powers the radio source. Whatever result we get, both interpretations are exciting.',\n"," 'Nature of the mm-continuum signal from PDS70c. How do dust grains trickle through protoplanetary gaps and reach the circumplanetary-disks (CPDs) that regulate the formation of giant planets? What sort of grains are such CPDs composed of? The recent detection, thanks to deep ALMA observations, of compact 350GHz signal around an Halpha point source, i.e. PDS70c, may bring some clues towards these questions. However, although the mm-dust continuum is usually associated to dust emission, free-free emission can be dominant in the case of a compact body, such as a star or planet. The main goal of this proposal is to test whether the bulk of the signal seen in PDS70c corresponds to free-free emission or to dust emission. In the case of pure dust emission, we also aim to estimate the size of the dust grains comprising the CPD using its spectral index. The Band4 continuum will test for a free-free component, while the Band9 continuum will measure the mass of optically thin emission from small dust. A middle point in Band8 will be used to test for a concave spectrum, resulting from both free-free and dust emissions, and will allow accounting for dust optical depth if the free-free contribution is found to be negligible.',\n"," 'Dynamics in Venus Sub-cloud Atmosphere. An outstanding uncertainty in the maintenance of Venus atmospheric super-rotation is the dominant mechanism of angular momentum transport from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere. The atmospheric thermal lapse rate governs which of these processes can occur, with an adiabatic rate suggesting thermally direct transport and a sub-adiabatic rate suggesting primarily wave-based transport. If wave-based transport is dominant, signatures of horizontal wave activity should also be present in the sub-cloud atmosphere. We propose observations of Venus with ALMA and the VLA achieving vertical resolution of 10 m from 0-40 kilometers and with sufficient sensitivity to resolve weak thermal wave signatures in the sub-cloud atmosphere.',\n"," 'C+ Emission from Luminous and Normal LAGER Lyman Alpha Galaxies at z=7. We will observe the [CII] line for 6 Lyman-alpha emitters at z~7 from our LAGER survey. LAGER is the largest volume narrow-band survey at this redshift. The current sample is from a 1.2 million cubic-Mpc survey, which we aim to extend to 10 million cubic-Mpcs. After more than 12 nights of imaging and 3 of optical spectrosocopy we have a uniformly selected sample of 27 high confidence LAEs. We see an excess of highly luminous (L > 3 L*) LAEs. This parallels the change seen at the bright end of Lyman-break galaxies but is more dramatic. Do we have an excess of luminous LAEs because star-formation properties of galaxies have changed at cosmic dawn? or is it because the luminous galaxies form an ionized bubble in the local IGM, allowing Lyman-alpha to escape? [CII] observations will probe kinematics and dynamical masses, measure SFR independent of LyA, and measure velocity offsets between LyA and [CII] to test reionization. We will observe the [CII] line in three luminous and three \"normal\" Lyman-alpha emitters. This will double the number of galaxies at Z>6 where both LyA and [CII] have been observed, and will be the largest LyA selected sample at z=7.',\n"," 'High-resolution Mapping of Cold Molecular Gas in the Turbulent IGM of Stephans Quintet. Stephans Quintet contains a highly turbulent multi-phase IGM, partly caused by a giant shock wave driven into preexisting gas by a high-speed intruder galaxy. JWST/MIRI observations, and a previous limited ALMA study, have revealed dramatic filaments of warm post-shocked gas mixed with cold molecular clumps, all of which is embedded in million-degree gas detected by Chandra. We propose to fully map the cold molecular gas in CO (2-1) over the entire inner Stephans Quintet at the same spatial resolution as MIRI/JWST to allow us to build a comprehensive picture of the interaction and possible mixing of gas phases as kinetic energy is dissipated behind the fast shock. This includes exploring, a) whether cold clouds shattered by the flow of hot gas behind the shock, can explain the existence of so much warm gas in the group, b) where and under what molecular conditions, stars can form from the turbulent gas, and c) determine whether the mysterious spider-leg filaments seen by JWST surrounding NGC 7319, are somehow kinematically associated with an known AGN outflow. When combined with existing spectacular JWST observations the ALMA observations will be a great Legacy value.',\n"," 'Mapping CO emission in galaxies from the JINGLE survey. JINGLE is a new large program on the JCMT that is mapping 193 nearby spiral galaxies. The sample has been selected to have extensive ancillary data from the UV to the far-infrared as well as resolved integral-field optical spectroscopy. We propose to use the stand-alone ACA to make CO(2-1) maps of the 20 brightest JINGLE targets observed so far in CO(2-1) with the JCMT. These ACA maps will allow us to measure the angular extent and radial profile of the CO emission, which will produce a more accurate estimate of the total molecular gas mass as well as resolve its spatial distribution, kinematics, and gas-to-dust ratio. We will also investigate the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt law and CO Tully-Fisher relation. These JINGLE galaxies are interesting targets for the ACA because they are more gas rich than other resolved nearby galaxy surveys and already have global CO, HI, and dust data available.',\n"," 'Imaging the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect of an X-ray faint massive galaxy cluster discovered by Hyper Suprime-Cam. We propose to observe the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) of a newly discovered galaxy cluster, HSC J115214+003126 at z=0.47. Our target is the most massive galaxy cluster so far detected with S/N>6 during the on-going weak gravitational lensing survey by Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the 8.2m Subaru Telescope. Unlike the other clusters already observed via the SZE by ALMA, HSC J115214+003126 does not have any known X-ray counterpart. With the proposed deep observation in Band 3, we aim at i) the first detection of hot gas in this system, ii) unveiling its structure and dynamical status by examining the presence of a cool core and searching for merger shocks, and iii) understanding possible biases in previous surveys. Our proposal serves as the first ALMA-HSC joint study on galaxy clusters.',\n"," 'Cold gas on the red sequence: resolving maintenance-mode feedback in action. We have recently discovered a new class of quiescent, relatively common early-type galaxy that hosts large-scale, AGN-driven winds (Cheung et al., 2016, Roy et al, 2018). This discovery is exciting because these red geysers- found in ~10% of the quiescent population- may be the missing energy source needed to maintain galaxies quiescent at late times. As initially revealed in integral field observations from the MaNGA survey (Bundy et al., 2015), red geysers feature characteristic ionized gas velocity fields that are roughly co-aligned with bisymmetric features of enhanced line emission that we believe trace the wind axis. The mass of gas is the ionized phase is small, but most of the mass is expected to be in the cold gas component. We propose to map two prototypical red geysers in CO(1-0) to obtain information about the amount of molecular gas associated with the outflow, its kinematics and mass outflow rate. These observations would therefore represent one of the most direct tests of the effect of maintenance-mode AGN feedback on its galaxy host.',\n"," 'A survey of prestellar, high-mass clump candidates: constraining models of high-mass star formation. [This is a re-submission of a previously approved B-rank proposal (2017.1.00716.S) from Cycle 5. At the moment, 10% of the project has been observed (only 7m and TP). We will withdraw the observations from this Cycle 6 for targets that are observed in Cycle 5]. The lack of a significant amount of prestellar, high-mass cluster-forming clumps has made hard to conclusively refute or support models of high-mass star formation. In addition, the insufficient sensitivity and angular resolution have done challenging to unambiguously test observational predictions. In our pilot survey, we dectect no high-mass prestellar cores, the more massive cores (<18 Msun) are subvirialized, and surveys that only make single-pointing observations are highly imcomplete. Expanding on our pilot survey, we aim to observe a complete sample of prestellar high-mass clump candidates with masses >500 Msun, temperatures <16 K, distances <5 kpc. All our targets are IR-dark up to 70 um.',\n"," 'Physical and Chemical Properties of Giant Molecular Clouds in the Starburst Ring of NGC 1068. We propose the band 3 observations toward the central ~1 diameter region of NGC1068 with high spatial and velocity resolution (1.1\"=80pc and 1.3 km/s) in the 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0), CS(2-1) and CH3OH(2-1). Using ALMA CYCLE 0 DATA for the central ~1 region of NGC 1068, systematic spatial variations of the CS/13CO and CH3OH/13CO are found at the GMA-scale (~ a few 100 pc), alhtough the observed C18O/13CO are found to be fairly uniform. We find that CH3OH/13CO is decreased in the bar-end regions where active star formation occurs, suggesting that the production of CH3OH is suppressed there due to high dust temperature (>20K). Clearly, the next step is to study the chemical and physical properties of ISM in the GMC-scale (<100 pc) and their relation to the global scale (> kpc) structures in galaxies. The primary goal of the proposed study is to identify GMC-scale clouds in optically-thin tracers and study a GMC-scale variation of chemical and physical properties across the disk region. We will verify our scenario on the CH3OH/13CO ratio variations in GMC scales.',\n"," 'Lifting the shroud on two IRAC-dark dusty star-forming galaxies. We propose ALMA 12m array linescans for two IRAC-dark (m_4.5 > 24 ABmag) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) discovered with ALMA behind two lensing clusters. Both objects are detected at high S/N in ALMA, yet lack clear counterparts even in medium-deep HST and IRAC imaging, implying that they either lie at very high redshifts (z>6-10) or are obscured by unusually high A_v (>5-10) at z~3-5. We aim to detect at least 2 bright CO transitions in order to establish firm redshifts and characterize their molecular gas (mass, excitation curves, kinematics, t_depl) and dust properties (mass, temperature). Precise physical constraints from ALMA, which are unattainable by UV/opt/NIR/MIR methods, will advance our understanding of star formation for these intriguing objects and place them into cosmological context amongst star-forming galaxies more generally.',\n"," 'The Missing Link: Gas Accretion Flows in the Galactic Bar toward the Central Molecular Zone. We propose to observe 25 clouds in the Galactic bar with gas temperatures of tens of K and broad lines (>~10km/s) - these clouds are the best candidates for the gas flow that feeds the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of our Milky Way. Whereas the CMZ is a well studied region at all wavelengths (including the supermassive black hole Sgr A* and the vigorous star forming region Sgr B2), the streams that feed the CMZ have largely been neglected. Modelling shows that the gas likely follows x1 and x2 orbits in the bar potential, enforced by the bar potential, with gas accretion at various points and cloud-cloud collisions from dynamical effects like (self-)intersecting orbits and accretion overshooting. We propose to probe these processes by observing molecular lines that trace physical parameters such as shocks, turbulence, temperature, ionization etc. The ACA+TP is the perfect telescope for our study as it allows us to probe relatively large regions at molecular clump resolution with adequate sensitivity. The data will provide an invaluable grid of cloud properties for improved detailed dynamical models of the inner Galaxy.',\n"," 'A Survey of Very Low Luminosity Objects in Serpens and Ophiuchus. Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are young stellar sources that are defined by luminosities less than 0.1 solar luminosity and rising mid-infrared spectral energy distributions. But what exactly are they: brown dwarfs or low-mass stars in formation, systems exhibiting low accretion, extremely young objects? We propose to characterize the VeLLO class through observations of 1.3mm continuum and CO J=2-1 outflow emission of a sample of 12 high-probability candidates in the Serpens and Ophiuchus molecular clouds. This survey is expected to double the number of confirmed VeLLOs, provide estimates on the masses of their inner envelopes, and help address questions concerning the nature of VeLLOs.',\n"," 'A Complete Survey of Protostellar Disk Gas and Dust Structure in Taurus. Recent findings of substructures in the protoplanetary disks of nearly every 1-5 Myr old pre-main sequence star observed with high enough spatial resolution suggest that these disks may already have undergone a significant amount of planet/planetesimal formation. If so, then younger, <1 Myr, protostellar disks likely better represent the initial disk conditions before significant dust processing or planet formation has occurred. To date, however, there have been few large samples of protostellar disks observed with high resolution (<0.5\") in both gas and dust to study their structure. Here we propose to observe every embedded protostar in Taurus. We will map their disks with 870 micron continuum and spectral line observations at ~0.3\" resolution to determine the geometry of the circumstellar material, and couple our observations with existing VLA 9 mm observations of similar resolution to constrain the maximum dust grain sizes in the disks and search for evidence of the onset of planet formation at early times. The proposed observations will allow us to put together a comprehensive picture of the initial conditions in disks, from which all subsequent planet formation will proceed.',\n"," 'SMC B1 #1 is the New Perseus: The Relationship Between Av and CO at Low Metallicity. We propose to map the quiescent, low metallicity molecular cloud SMC B1 #1 in 12CO, 13CO and C18O (2-1) with ALMA Band 6 at 1\" resolution (0.3 pc in the SMC). We will combine these CO observations with Av maps at matched 1\" resolution from Hubble Space Telescope imaging. The 0.3 pc comparison between CO and Av will let us answer key questions about the effect of metallicity on the structure and physical properties of molecular gas. We will measure the Av where CO becomes bright, constraining models for ``CO-dark gas. In addition, we will compare the CO-Av relationship in SMC B1 #1 to (1) what is observed in Milky Way clouds at matched physical scales and (2) what is predicted by simulations of low metallicity cloud structure. With the combined power of ALMA and HST, SMC molecular clouds can be studied as if they were Perseus or Taurus, providing an unprecedented view of molecular gas under low metallicity conditions.',\n"," 'Are dense cores formed through shocks? An observational test in Ophiuchus. Dense cores are the places where stars are formed, and as such they provide the initial conditions for star formation. Several of the models that try to explain the dense core formation process involve shocks (either due to supersonic turbulence or by accretion shocks). However, no direct evidence for those shocks have been found until now. We just received ALMA Cycle 4 data on a starless core in Ophiuchus that shows clear evidence for gas recently affected by a shock (large abundances of CH3OH and spatial distribution anticorrelated with dense gas tracers, NH2D). These observations provide the first direct evidence for shocks around a dense core. We propose to expand the search for evidence of shocked gas on 3 more dense cores in Ophiuchus, repeating the succesful setup used in Cycle 4, to look for evidence of shocked gas around dense cores. This will be the first step into determining how common are shocks involved in the formation of dense cores.',\n"," 'Ionized Gas, Radiation Field, Masses, and Dust Temperature in Forming Massive Clusters in the NGC253 Starburst. Our ALMA observations in B7 at 0.1\" resolution identified massive super star clusters (SSCs) in the process of formation in the core of the NGC253 starburst (Leroy et al. 2018). Follow up at 0.03\" measured sizes and uncovered outflows from these SSCs (Levy et al., in prep.). The characterization of these clusters is needed to understand the high-efficiency \"starburst mode\" of star formation, the life cycle of massive clusters, and the effects of massive-star feedback on star forming clouds. This proposal aims to: 1) directly measure the ionizing photon flux and synchrotron emission in these objects, which impact the stellar masses and ages of the clusters, 2) constrain the dust optical depth and dramatically improve estimates for the temperature and gas mass of these sources, and 3) measure the sizes of the HII regions associated with these SSCs and to search for ionized gas outflows. Our observations also yield a direct constraint on the hardness of the ionizing radiation field and on the high mass end of the stellar IMF in these SSCs. These data are key to build a picture of the dominant star formation mechanism in starbursting systems at low and high redshift.',\n"," 'The Chlorinity and Chemical Composition of Europas Subsurface Ocean. Europa, an icy world orbiting Jupiter, is one of the most promising places for harboring life in the outer solar system. A global subsurface ocean was inferred to exist inside Europa from the diversity of surface geological features and the magnetic field measurements made by the Galileo spacecraft. In addition, detections of the atomic O and H emission by HST also suggested water vapors outgassing from Europas south polar region, similar to Enceladus plume activities. As the first step in understanding the potential of Europa being an abode for life, we propose to use ALMA to study the chlorinity and chemical composition of Europas subsurface ocean, targeting the molecular species of NaCl, KCl and H2O in the atmosphere. Our proposed work will provide crucial information of Europas outgassing events, the sources of Europas atmospheric species and their associated radiolytic effects (irradiated vs. prior-to-irradiated) as they can provide better constraints in the ocean chemistry models such as the salinity and the oxidation state. It will also contribute to future space missions, such as NASAs next flagship mission to Europa and ESAs JUICE mission.',\n"," 'Extra-planar & Diffuse Molecular Gas in Spiral Galaxies. Extra-planar layers in spiral galaxies are the interface between the IGM and star-forming disk and are essential for understanding disk-halo flows. They have been studied extensively for all ISM phases with the exception of molecular gas. All other ISM components show extended extra-planar material, most connected to star formation. It remains to be seen if this is true for the molecular component. Recent observations have found evidence for diffuse extra-planar molecular layers. These studies, however, were completed for face-on or moderately-inclined galaxies, and thus unable to fully-constrain their heights. Ideally, extra-planar layers are observed edge-on. Such observations have been performed for only 3 galaxies and show strikingly different results. Thus, a larger samples are needed to truly understand this phenomenon. We began with our Cycle 4 pilot study of NGC 55 and aim to expand our sample to include galaxies with a range of star formation rate densities. Using the unique power of the ACA, we will map the vertical extent of CO, a strong tracer of molecular gas.',\n"," 'Characterizing Molecular-Cloud-Scale Chemistry in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the nearest external galaxy, whose metallicity is known to be lower by factor of 2 than in our Galaxy. In our previous study, we observed 7 molecular clouds in the LMC with the Mopra 22 m telescope and found the molecular-cloud scale (~10 pc) chemical composition characteristic to the LMC. To explore its origin, we resolve the cores (~0.5 pc) and characterize their chemical compositions. According to our Mopra observations, CCH is found to be abundant in the LMC clouds than that of our Galaxy, while CH3OH is less abundant in the LMC. This is interpreted as the effect of extended photodissociation regions (PDRs) due to the lower abundance of dust grains. In addition, abundances of sulfur-bearing molecules, CS and SO, slightly differ from cloud to cloud, probably reflecting the evolutionary stages of each cloud. We examine these characteristic features at a high angular resolution.',\n"," 'Searching for Sintering-induced Rings in the Disk of LkCa 15. Concentric and axisymmetric dust rings appear to be prevalent in protoplanetary disks. The sintering mechanism predicts that bright, optically thick rings should be formed at locations outside the snowlines of the major volatiles in disks, which may play a key role in creating the axisymmetric ring features. Recent ALMA N2H+ observations indicate that two disks, LkCa 15 and GM Aur, have very similar snowline structures. High angular resolution continuum observations of the GM Aur disk have already showed two bright dust rings that sit just outside the locations of each of the CO and N2 snowlines respectively, a double-ring system consistent with the sintering hypothesis. Here we propose to resolve the substructure of the LkCa 15 disk by imaging the dust continuum at 5 AU resolution to compare with the locations of snowlines determined in the disk. The presence of similar double-ring systems coincident with snowline locations in both LkCa 15 and GM Aur disks will provide unambiguous evidence of the aggregate sintering mechanism operating in the disks around young stars.',\n"," 'Interactions, Runaways, and Explosive Outflows from Compact Groups of Forming Massive Protostars. We propose to image three NEW candidate explosive protostellar outflows with ~500 AU linear resolution in CO 2-1, SiO 5-4, other molecules, H30-alpha, and the 1.3 mm continuum. These massive star forming complexes are at distances of 1.5, 2.8-3.7, and ~3.7 kpc, contain massive and powerful outflows, multiple H2 fingers, and/or `bullets with morphologies similar to Orions BN/KL outflow. The BN/KL outflow located ~0.1 pc behind the Orion Nebula was powered by the dynamic interaction of several stars that resulted in their ejection as runaways. Our ALMA 1\" images reveal hundreds of CO and SiO streamers expanding from the stellar ejection site with speeds of up to 150 km/s. ALMA observations of the three NEW targets will measure their energy and momentum inputs, locate their sources, and constrain the lifetimes and rate of explosive outflows. These powerful outflows represent a new type of feedback in massive star forming regions and contribute significantly to the self-regulation of star formation. Such protostellar explosions may be responsible for some recently detected luminous infrared-only transients observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope in nearby star-forming galaxies.',\n"," 'Feedback in action: tracing the extreme interplay between radio jets and ISM in galaxies. We propose observations of the molecular outflow recently detected by APEX in CO(2-1) in the nearby southern AGN IC5063. This object is one of the best examples of a jet-driven outflow and the first case where cold gas (HI-21cm) has been discovered associated with such an outflow. The HI outflow has been observed to be at the location of a bright radio lobe (about 0.5 kpc from the nucleus) and an ionized outflow has also been detected at that location. The high spatial resolution and sensitivity of ALMA will allow us to trace the molecular gas in this outflow and compare this with the other phases of the gas. IC5063 is the best example where the molecular outflow can be spatially resolved and the kinematic of the gas studied and compared with theoretical predictions. The proposed observations represent a first step of a detailed study of the molecular gas in this object. They we will allow us to: 1) confirm the blueshifted wing of the CO profile detected by APEX and establish its location; 2) disentangle it from the regularly rotating gas associated with the large scale disk; 3) image the distribution and the detailed kinematics of the molecular gas associated with the outflow; 4) use all this to identify the likely origin of the outflowing molecular gas and its characteristics (mass, mass outflow rate, kinetic energy and comparison with Eddington and bolometric luminosities) Gaseous outflows are now recognized to be complex, multi-phase structures but only detailed observations in nearby objects like the one proposed here will allow us to fully understand their impact for galaxy evolution. The proposed observations of IC5063 will demonstrate that ALMA offers new and exciting and unique opportunities to study the physics of AGN-induced outflows and their role in galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'To what extent is the protostellar outflow HH 212 driven by collimated jets?. HH 212 is a text-book example of a jet driven protostellar outflow. Current jet-launching models predict that a wind driven component should be present, but as of yet, it has eluded conclusive detection in HH 212. We propose to use the stand-alone ACA mode of ALMA Cycle 4 in Band 6 to perform the first full-scale, high-sensitivity, short uv spacing, observation of HH 212 to map previously undetectable flux. With the new data we will perform mass-velocity (with optical depth correction), and position-velocity analyses to conclusively detect and study the wind componenet of HH 212, and in turn obtain a greater understanding of the kinematics of protostellar outflows in general.',\n"," 'The mass loss history of the \"fresh\" carbon star TX Piscium - A showcase for stellar evolution. We propose observations of the Circumstellar Envelope (CSE) of the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star TX Psc, which probably has transitioned from oxygen-rich to carbon-rich very recently, judged by its low C/O ratio and location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. So far, no proper radiative transfer modeling for the CSE of TX Psc could be carried out because of its complexity: Herschel/PACS images of thermal dust show a spherical shell-structure at 17\" around the star, while previous CO single-dish observations of TX Psc only confirm CO emission at offset positions about 20\" from the star, but do not reveal the detailed molecular gas morphology and kinematics. The dusty shell might be associated with a molecular counterpart, which suggests the formation through a very recent thermal pulse. We want to determine the mass loss history of TX Psc, clarify nature and origin of the shell-like structure around it, and derive stellar wind parameters for subsequent modeling of mass loss and stellar parameters. Observations of the molecular CSE will allow us to constrain the evolutionary status of TX Psc and contribute to our understanding of the transition from O-rich to carbon AGB stars.',\n"," 'Kinematics of the incipient bipolar nebula of L2 Puppis. The final stages of stellar evolution involve fascinating physics, complex chemistry and spectacular structures (disks, planetary nebulae,...). The red giant L2 Pup is likely experiencing the early stages of the formation of a planetary nebula. Its remarkable proximity (64pc) makes it the second nearest AGB star. VLT adaptive optics images revealed a dust disk seen almost edge-on, a close-in companion and a compact bipolar structure. But these encouraging results remain qualitative. We do not know the exact evolutionary state of the central AGB star, neither its mass, and our interpretation in terms of bipolar structure is currently based on its visible morphology only. We will use ALMA to determine the stellar mass and the geometry of mass loss. Our first science goal is to measure the rotation profile of the disk from the CO(3-2) line to derive the mass of the central stars. This will enable us to pinpoint the evolutionary state of the AGB. Our second goal aims at testing the bipolarity hypothesis, by mapping the velocity structure of the extended wind in the CO(2-1) line. L2 Pup offers a unique vantage point on the disk-wind interaction.',\n"," 'Gas accretion onto dense cores from early to late evolutionary phases of massive filamentary clouds. High-mass star forming clouds often exhibit filamentary structures in which dense cores of ~<10 Msun are embedded. In order to form high-mass protostars, these dense cores must accrete gas from the environment. Such a picture, if proven universal, alters the current high-mass star formation models. However direct evidence of accretion onto dense cores in filaments is rare. We have selected 8 massive filamentary clouds encompassing a variety of evolutionary phases, and obtained VLA, SMA, and IRAM-30m data. Dense cores of ~<10 Msun are found in the filaments. Velocity gradients along filaments and infall signatures along the line of sight are found with VLA and IRAM-30m data, but the insufficient angular and spectral resolutions prevent us from tracing gas accretion onto dense cores. Here we propose to use ALMA to observe optically thick HCO+/HCN, and optically thin H13CO+/NH2D lines, in order to study both radial and axial gas accretion toward dense cores in filaments and inform high-mass star formation models.',\n"," 'The impact of magnetic field in the core fragmentation and the formation of single and binary stars. The role of magnetic field in the fragmentation from ~0.01 pc scale condensation to single, binary, or high-order multiple systems has not been explored yet following a statistical approach, because the lack of the magnetic field observations of a large sample at ~0.01 pc scales. Recently, ALMA have made significant progress in studying the magnetic field at ~0.01s pc scales toward massive star cluster-forming regions. We build this ALMA proposal on these great progresses with the aims of addressing: how does magnetic field affect the fragmentation and the formation of single/binary/multiple systems in the massive star cluster-forming regions? what are the properties of final fragments, e.g, multiplicity fraction and the distribution of companions separation? Our case study of G333 has revealed some hints on these subjects. However, statistics studies are needed to reach a comprehensive understanding of multiple systems formation.',\n"," 'Are Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies at the Center of Multiple Mergers?. Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies, or Hot DOGs, are a population of high redshift, hyperluminous galaxies identified by the WISE mission, whose luminosities are powered by luminous dust-enshrouded quasars. Recent band 6 observations of the most luminous Hot DOG, W2246-0526, centered on the [NII]205um emission line, have shown that this object is at the center of a multiple merger, accreting its three closest neighbors. The deep continuum map shows dusty tidal tails that extend by up to 30kpc from W2246-0526 to the three neighboring galaxies. We request similar observations for 5 additional Hot DOGs to probe the relation between multiple merger activity and this population of hyperluminous dusty quasars.',\n"," 'ALMA observation of the nearest short GRB. Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) are presumed to result from compact object mergers (of two neutron stars, or one neutron star and one stellar mass black hole). Today, Fermi detected sGRB 170817A and we detected a bright optical afterglow in subsequent follow-up, suggesting that the sGRB may be the nearest detected to date. Unlike the X-ray and optical emission, the millimeter afterglow emission will peak on timescales of several days, maximizing the chance of detection and allowing us to measure the jet energy and collimation and the circumburst density.',\n"," 'The surface magnetic field of AGB stars: Zeeman measurements of atmospheric OH. Magnetic fields appear ubituitous throughout the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, the magnetic field strength on the surface of AGB stars is very poorly constrained. It is the magnetic field near the surface that will possibly affect the stellar mass loss and hence evolution. So far only one AGB star has had its surface magnetic field measured using observations in the visible and very few other AGB stars are accessible with this technique. Maser observations have revealed strong magnetic fields in the CSEs, but it is unclear if these measurements can be extrapolated to the star. Recently, ALMA discovered non-masing excited OH in the atmosphere of AGB stars. The magnetic succeptibility of OH means that there is now a direct probe of the magnetic field near the stellar surface. Here we propose to detect the magnetic field of the AGB star W Hya for which maser observations imply a field of several Gauss near the surface. If we can confirm this field we can, for the first time, benchmark the maser measurements in the CSEs with the surface field and determine if the magnetic field has the power to affect the mass loss mechanism.',\n"," 'Studying the effects of variable UV heating on the outer disk. Here we propose to use ALMA to undertake the first variability study of UV sensitive lines in the millimeter in an object that is known to have substantial UV variability: GM Aur. We propose for a total of 4.7 hrs to observe the CN and HCN lines daily over nine days. We request that these data be coordinated with approved Chandra-HST-VLA observations to observe GM Aur on Jan 11 and 19; we have also secured simultaneous Spitzer data and ground-based high-resolution NIR spectra on Jan 11 and 19 along with ground-based high-resolution optical spectra on Jan 12 - 18. Specifically, using HST and ground-based optical spectra we will be able to track changes in the UV emisison of GM Aur over nine days. If we detect variability, this would be the first observed link between UV emission and the heating of gas in the outer disk.',\n"," 'Unravelling the enigmatic mass loss of Betelgeuse. Betelgeuse is the most prominent target for a detailed study of mass-loss in a massive red supergiant. We are engaged in a long term project to trace the ejected material from the photosphere to the interstellar medium, and understand its kinematics and chemical evolution. We assembled a unique data set, resolving the stellar surface and MOLsphere by interferometry, and the dusty envelope at larger distances. We observed oxygen-rich dust in thermal infrared (8-20 microns) up to 100 R* (~2.5\"), and Herschel provided us with images of the dust emission between 15\" and 7. The dusty envelope of Betelgeuse follows an intricate pattern, with a major interface located between 0.5 and 1.0\", where molecules condense into dust grains. ALMA will resolve for the first time this key dust formation shell, in the CO J=3-2 and other molecular lines. We will trace the kinematics of the gaseous component from the photopshere, to the dust condensation region, and up to the dust clumps observed in the infrared at several arcseconds from the star. The molecular kinematics are mandatory to understand mass loss and dust formation, and only ALMA can reach the necessary resolution and sensitivity.',\n"," 'Barnard 30: a pre- and proto-brown dwarfs nursery?. We propose to confirm the pre- and proto-brown dwarf nursery recently discovered in the dark cloud Barnard 30, within the Lambda Orionis Star Forming Region. A sample of very low mass star and brown dwarf (BD) candidates are located in this place, and have been classified as Class I or Class II objects using IRAC/Spitzer and excess at 24 microns (from MIPS/Spitzer). We mapped recently the area with LABOCA and SABOCA at 870 and 350 microns and we detected a group of very low-mass cold dust condensations (~0.012-0.07 Msun). The southern part of this region (the part closer to the O star lambda Ori) shows a group of submillimeter sources associated with the coldest Spitzer sources (at 70 and 24 microns), suggesting they are very young. In addition, there are several very low-mass submillimeter detections with no MIPS/IRAC counterparts, which are excellent candidates to pre-BD cores. We propose to observe these pre- and proto-BD candidates with ALMA in continuum in band 7, in order to characterize their dusty envelopes, the stage of its evolution, and their gravitational stage at scales of 400 AUs. If we find pre- and proto-BDs surrounded by substantial envelopes and disks, similar to the ones observed in the first stages of low-mass protostars, they would provide direct support for in situ formation of BDs. Therefore, this proposal, requesting only 2.3 hr time, will impact in the different proposed scenarios concerning the formation of brown dwarfs. Previous efforts to characterize the formation of BDs have been performed in individual objects, but this would be the first time these studies are done in a whole region.',\n"," 'Probing an Inner Disk at the Jupiter Orbital Radius around DM Tau. In ALMA cycle 5 observations (2017.1.01460.S), we discovered the Solar-system-scale inner disk at r=4 AU around DM Tau (d =140 pc). However, due to large beam size of about 6 AU in our observations, the inner disk was marginally resolved as two blobs. To spatially resolve the inner disk in cycle 6 observations, we propose band 6 dust continuum observations with the higher spatial resolution of about 20 mas. Since our cycle 5 observations indicated that the inner disk could be asymmetric and eccentric, we aim to confirm whether the DM Taus inner disk really exhibits such structures in cycle 6 observations. Intriguingly, a candidate massive planet with a mass of 3 Mjup at r =6 AU around DM Tau was recently reported by Keck observations. Therefore, our proposed observations could indicate that the presence of massive planets at r= several AU both influences the geometry of the inner disk and plays an important role in planet formation at the Solar-system-scale region at several AU. There have been only few disks that are clearly resolved down to about 4 AU scale; thus, DM Tau plays an important role in understanding the planet formation at Solar system scale.',\n"," 'Molecular Clouds and Star Formation: Across M83. We propose an arcsecond-resolution imaging of molecular gas in the central 10 kpc of M83, a third of which has been taken in Cycle 3. We will study molecular gas and cloud properties, star formation, their interrelation as well as relation to gas dynamics. M83 is the nearest face-on grand-design spiral galaxy with a stellar bar. Our mapping area contains two grand-design spiral arms, entire bar, and most of star forming regions in the galaxy. We will resolve individual GMCs at 20 pc resolution and achieve 10-sigma mass sensitivity of 1e4 Msun for beam-size clouds. Statistical properties of the GMCs will be anlyzed as a function of gas dynamical environment (e.g., circumnuclear, on/off bar, bar-end, on-/inter-arm, and outer disk). We will also quantify using HST data the association of GMCs to young star clusters and HII regions. Our central question is : How do galactic structures such as the bar and spiral arms affect the properties of GMCs and subsequent star formation? Our unprecedentedly detailed wide-area observations will allow a significant progress toward its answer. The data will also serve as a base for multi-wavelength studies of M83 by the community.',\n"," 'Origins of H2CO in protoplanetary disks. Organic ices are the expected major reservoirs of volatile organic material in protoplanetary disks. Their distributions across disks are key to predict the organic composition of planetesimals, and thus the likelihood of organic delivery to terrestrial planets. H2CO is the only detected molecule in disks that may directly probe this reservoir of organic ices. H2CO can form together with CH3OH through CO ice hydrogenation, and this pathway followed by non-thermal desorption is the proposed dominant origin of observed H2CO gas in disks. We propose to constrain the relative importance of ice and gas formation pathways of H2CO in the protoplanetary disk TW Hya, by 1) imaging the H2CO gas distribution with respect to the known CO snowline location at ~30 AU, and 2) determining the H2CO/CH3OH abundance ratio. If H2CO gas originates from H2CO ice, it will only be present in a ring, with the inner edge at the CO snowline and H2CO/CH3OH~1. In contrast if H2CO is mainly a gas-phase product it will present a centrally peaked emission profile and H2CO/CH3OH>>1. The proposed observations will thus directly teach us what the origins of H2CO in disks are.',\n"," 'Magnetic field structure in the jet acceleration and collimation zone of quasar 3C273. High Faraday rotation measure of 5.0 x 10^5 rad/m^2 has been recently observed in the nearby radio-loud quasar 3C273 within ALMA Band 6. This has opened up a new window for studying the magneto-ionic medium in and around the jet base in active galactic nuclei. Here we propose one 8-hr long track of Band 6 VLBI observations of 3C273 with the EHT+ALMA array in order to make the first ever map of in-band Faraday rotation at 1.3mm. Our aim is to constrain the spatial distribution of the high rotation measure plasma in and around the jet base at a resolution of 100 Schwarzschild radii. The proposed observations would provide constraints on the poorly known magnetic field structure in the jet acceleration and collimation zone. For example, if significant gradient in the Faraday rotation measure in direction transverse to the jet is seen, this would provide strong evidence for the existence of an ordered toroidal magnetic field component. Furthermore, observing Faraday rotation measure from the jet acceleration and collimation zone provides a way to make more direct comparisons with the magnetohydrodynamic jet formation simulations than what is possible through emission maps.',\n"," 'The frontier of rocky planet formation: are low-mass stars super-efficient?. Planet formation is significantly more successful around low-mass stars than for Solar-type stars like our own. However, this could be the result of a truly greater efficiency of planet formation or stellar mass-dependent differences in planet survival after formation. We propose to test whether planet formation is fundamentally different for low-mass stars by observing them after planet formation has finished, using the brightness and detection frequency of their debris disks as a proxy for the success of planetesimal growth. We propose a deep and comprehensive survey of all 39 M-type members of the beta Pictoris moving group (BPMG). Using a detailed collisional population model benchmarked against Herschel surveys of nearby stars, we have made predictions for the BPMG M-dwarf population, providing a reference model and hypothesis to test. Based on this model we expect about 10 detections of new disks. If no detections are made, we will conclude that planet formation around low-mass stars is efficient because it is able to mop up all planetesimals. If many detections are made, the conclusion is that the disk masses around young stars may be much higher than currently believed.',\n"," 'ALMA ingestigation into the origin of the far infrared excess emission from the hot spot of the radio galaxy Pictor A. An ALMA/ACA imaging photometry at Band 8 of the west hot spot accompanied by the radio galaxy Pictor A is proposed to investigate the origin of the far-infrared excess discovered from this objects with the Herschel/SPIRE. It was interpreted that this excess is produced in 10-pc scale (about 100 mas) substructures within the hot spot via the turbulence acceleration. However, due to the large beam size of the Herschel/SPIRE, the spatial association of the far-infrared source to the hot spot is unclear, and it is still possible that diffuse radio structures with a size of 10 arcsec associated to the host spot are the origin of the far-infrared excess. In order to settle this issue, the ALMA/ACA at Band 8 is an ideal instrument, thanks to its moderately good angular resolution and relatively large maximum recoverable size (about 3 arcsec and 15 arcsec, respectively) with a reasonable sensitivity. This observation will give an important insight into the particle acceleration process, especially the turbulence acceleration, in the hot spot.',\n"," 'Probing Accretion Flows from Filaments to Massive Star-Forming Cores. We propose to investigate filamentary accretion flows in the remarkable IRDC complexes, M17 SWex, where a delayed onset of massive star formation has been reported. Such delay may be explained by a longer accretion time for high-mass end of protostar mass function. Indeed, the dense clumps in this IRDC are found to be at the convergence of multiple filaments of parsec length and display the morphology of hub-filament systems. These hubs are likely nurturing massive protostars and accrete mass through their connecting filaments. We plan to 1) determine the mass accretion rate through filaments to hubs by observing the inflow motions along filaments with N2H+ (1-0); 2) assess the fragmentation in the filaments by identifying dense cores with the continuum and N2H+ emissions; 3) estimate mass accretion onto filaments from the surroudnings by analyzing the self-absorption feature in the HNC (1-0) spectra; 4) search for hot molecular cores with CH3CN lines. We will conduct a mosaic of 97 pointings in the C36-1 configuration in Band 3 to cover two hubs and their associated filaments',\n"," 'ALMA polarization observations of BL Lac during the first X-ray polarization campaign. Multiwavalength polarization, and in particular X-ray polarization, can be an important probe of the magnetic field geometry, acceleration physics, and high-energy emission processes of blazar jets. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) recently opened a new window to the Universe through high-energy polarization. Here we propose contemporaneous polarization observations of BL Lac in multiple ALMA bands during the first IXPE campaign targeting this source and low-synchrotron peaked blazars in general. The proposed observations will supplement our planned multiwavelength campaign in radio, optical, X-rays, and gamma-rays. Comparison of the millimeter-wave, optical, and X-ray polarization and measurement of the mmopticalUVX-ray continuum spectra of BL Lac, will provide data needed to determine, for the first time, the mechanism and location of the X-ray emission, as well as test particle acceleration models in blazar jets.',\n"," 'Imaging the wind that clears protoplanetary disks. Recent theoretical and observational work suggests that star-driven photoevaporation is, together with viscous accretion, the main physical process through which protoplanetary material is cleared out. Yet, evidence for photoevaporative winds is scarce, limited to spatially unresolved profiles from forbidden lines and excess cm emission on top of the dust thermal emission. We propose to obtain the first spatially resolved image of a photoevaporative wind and measure the extent of the wind. These data will unambiguously prove the existence of photoevaporative winds and provide an empirical estimate of the rate at which protoplanetary material is lost.',\n"," 'AGN feedback and molecular line flux ratios in luminous infrared galaxies. Molecular line flux ratios in the (sub)millimeter wavelength range can be a powerful tool to diagnose obscured energy sources in gas/dust-rich luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), because (1) dust extinction is very small, and (2) AGN and star-forming activity show different molecular line flux ratios, due to different feedback to the surrounding molecular gas. It has been argued that elevated HCN emission is observationally a good AGN indicator, but its physical origin is still yet to be clarified. Is it due to (a) higher HCN excitation and/or (b) HCN abundance enhancement in AGNs? Since molecular level population is primarily determined by three parameters, (1) H2 number density, (2) H2 kinetic temperature, and (3) molecular column density divided by line width, we need at least three independent observational constraints to physically understand molecular gas properties. We propose HCN/HCO+/HNC J=2-1 observations of LIRGs with available HCN/HCO+/HNC J=4-3 and J=3-2 data. From the J=4-3, J=3-2, and J=2-1 data, we will be able to, for the first time, obtain the physical understanding of observed molecular line flux ratios in AGN-important and starburst-dominated LIRGs.',\n"," 'CO Excitation Across the Local Galaxy Population. Increasingly, extragalactic surveys trace the molecular gas with the CO(2-1) line. This relies on a down-conversion to the fundamental CO(1-0) line and too many studies simply assume average CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratios (R21). However, recent studies find substantial R21 variation across and within galaxies. This has major implications for interpreting star formation scaling relations and characterizing the molecular gas. Before ALMA, R21 large sample studies were limited to poorer resolution and hampered by calibration uncertainties. This has restricted deriving firm quantitative conclusions. To take the next step, we propose new CO(1-0) observations to construct the first well-resolved, well-calibrated, and sensitive survey of R21 across a representative sample of 16 nearby galaxies. We will leverage public multiwavelength data to relate R21 variations to local conditions, galactic structure, and molecular cloud properties. ALMA observations are essential due to both their high angular resolution (~3 arcsec) and calibration stability. These observations will have major implications for key scaling relations and can be used to anchor large past and future CO(2-1) surveys.',\n"," 'Exploring the Evolution of Molecular Clouds by the Velocity Vectors in NGC1566. We propose to observe grand design nearby spiral galaxy NGC 1566 (at distance of 11 Mpc) in CO (1-0) with high resolution (106pc) enough to resolve GMA and without missing flux of extended gas. Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs, size; 50pc) and Giant Molecular Associations (GMAs, size; 500pc) are origins of massive stars. Recent observations suggest that the evolution of the GMCs and the GMAs is greatly influenced by the galactic dynamics on arms (e.g., shear and galactic shock). The shear may destruct the GMAs into the GMCs and the galactic shock trigger star-formation. These dynamics are described by the velocity vectors of molecular gas. However it is difficult to observe the velocity vectors directly because we can know only the line-of-sight velocity of the galaxies. We invented a powerful method (KN method) to derive the velocity vectors of face-on spiral galaxies from the line of sight velocities of CO. We applied the KN method for M51 and NGC 4321 for deriving shear. It is indicated that only strong shear destructs the GMAs. However the resolution and the sensitivity of these data are not enough for discussion about the dynamical evolution of GMCs and GMAs in detail. NGC 1566 (Decl.=-55d) is good target for ALMA. Our observations reveal the effect of the galactic dynamics on the formation/destruction of GMCs and GMAs and the efficiency of star-formation.',\n"," 'Imaging the Disk and Gas Accretion Around Young Massive Star S255 IR. The answer to how massive stars acquire their large mass is essential to our understanding of the massive star formation process. There is growing observational evidence suggesting that like their low-mass counterparts, newborn massive stars accrete through similar disk-outflow interaction as a scaled-up version of the standard disk-envelope paradigm. Detailed characterization of this process has been greatly hindered by the fact these disks/toroids were barely resolved in previously observations. We propose ALMA observations to investigate the elusive disk in the nearby massive star forming region S255 IR with unprecedented high sensitivity and angular resolution. At an angular resolution of 0.1\", direct high quality imaging of dust continuum, and more importantly, molecular line emission will allow us to resolve the disk and determine its physical and kinematical structure. The observations will enable us start addressing whether such disks or toroids around massive young stellar objects are Keplerian and stable; how the disks participate in the accretion process; and how the disks and outflows interact.',\n"," 'Pinpointing the origin of the astonishing structures seen in the HD 135344B disk. Recent observations of transition disks in both Optical Near-Infrared (ONIR) scattered light and (sub-)mm continuum emission have revealed complex structures such as spirals, rings and vortices. These are often all interpreted as the sign of ongoing planet formation, but so far no connection between the structures observed in scattered light and mm has been found. However, ALMA Cycle 1 Band 7 data of HD 135344B reveald new intriguing dust structures in the disk which show a remarkable correlation with NACO/VLT ONIR images of the same object. This unique features make it an ideal and unique candidate to investigate the connection between the micron-sized dust distribution probed in scattered light and the mm-sized dust structures observed by ALMA. Our goal is to detect so far unresolved dust substructures in HD135344 B, both close to the midplane (through Band 4 observations, at 0.062 resolution) and close to the upper layers (through Band 10 observations, at 0.062 resolution) in order to be able to unveil the link between scatterd light and mm structures, and to deepen our understanding of their origin.',\n"," 'Dense Molecular Gas Mapping of the Node in the Cosmic Web at z=3.1. A remarkable large-scale structure like a progenitor of the Great Wall has been found at z=3.1 in the SSA22 field. There are three-dimensional filamentary structures traced by a hundred of Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) and we mapped the 2x3 core region in ALMA Cycle2 at 1.1mm (the ALMA Deep Field in SSA22 or ADF22). Consequently, we found a rich cluster of dusty starbursts composed of 8 ALMA sources with spec-z = 3.09, suggesting the vigorous star-formation activity as well as enhanced AGN activity fueled by a large amount of molecular reservoir at the core of the large-scale structure. Here We propose a complete scan of CO(3-2) in ADF22. Our science goals are (i) Establishment the excess of cosmic H2 mass density at the core of the large-scale structure (ii) Unveiling the individual nature of discovered CO(3-2) emitters (iii) Clarifing the environmental dependence on the gaseous nature of SMGs, QSOs, and main-sequence galaxies. The propsoed observations will allow us to illustrate the on-going gas mass assembly in the large-scale structure for the first time.',\n"," 'An ALMA Band 1 and VLA survey to probe the solid reservoir of Lupus disks. The available dust reservoir in disks and its particle-size distribution are critical properties that impact the process of planet formation: dust is vital for the growth of planets and its size-distribution influences how grains growth and evolve. Thus, we need accurate constraints on the solid reservoir of disks. We propose a Joint ALMA-VLA program to observe most Class II disks in the Lupus region: to accurately constrain their solid reservoir in ALMA B1 at 8mm, and concurrently constrain the non-dust emission that contaminates B1 data, with VLA in U and X bands (2 and 3cm). We focus in Lupus as this region is one of the best studied, with available stellar properties and ALMA B7, B6, B3 observations. We define an unbiased sensitivity-limited sample of disks that encompass the full range of stellar masses in Lupus, complete for stellar masses above 0.6Msun. In this proposal, we show that ALMA B1 observations are crucial to probe the solid reservoir, as emission is more optically thin than existing B3 and B6 data and directly probes disk dust properties. We also demonstrate the need for VLA data, to constrain any possible contamination from non-dust emission in B1 observations.',\n"," 'GUAPOS: G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey. We propose to carry out an unbiased spectral line survey in Band 3 of the hot molecular core (HMC) G31.41+0.31 (G31). This is one of the most chemically rich HMCs in the Galaxy and an excellent target to search for heavy complex organic molecules (COMs), especially prebiotic ones. Band 3 is preferred because with respect to higher frequencies line blending is less severe and the dust emission is optically thinner. The main driver of the project is the identification of species never detected before outside the Galactic Center and of new species not yet detected in star-forming regions. We will concentrate on the study of: i) heavy COMs (especially with >10 atoms); ii) N-bearing COMs: like amino acetonitrile, precursor of glycine; iii) deuterated species: to obtain a more complete census of COMs in HMCs; iv) P-bearing and S-bearing species; and v) isotopologues: to understand the processes governing fractionation. The proper identification of species will allow us to derive important physical parameters, such as abundances, needed to constrain the chemical models and to investigate the relative contribution of surface-chemistry and gas-phase chemistry on the formation of COMs.',\n"," 'Direct Detection of Infall in a Protostellar System. Gravitational collapse is the foundation of modern star formation models. Although the model has been widely accepted, direct and unambiguous observational evidence has been elusive. A red-shifted absorption by a molecular line against the protostellar continuum emission provides unambiguous evidence of infall. The unprecedented resolution and sensitivity of ALMA allowed detection of this feature toward B335 (Evans et al. 2015), demonstrating the feasibility of this method. We propose to search for the infall signature in BHR71, an isolated Class 0 protostar similar to B335, but with 10 times the luminosity and the mass infall rate. We have extensive observations on BHR71, where we find hints of infall, as well as a 3-D dust radiative transfer model. Therefore, BHR71 is an excellent target for comparison with B335, but the resolving power of ALMA is necessary to detect the signature of infall.',\n"," 'The bright end of the submm galaxy counts: real or not? v1. Recent submm interferometric studies with ALMA and SMA of bright submm sources from single-dish bolometer surveys have hinted that most of the brightest sources (850um fluxes > 10mJy) actually represent blends of several, fainter, SMGs. This would have significant implications for the number density of the most luminous SMGs, Hyper-Luminous IR Galaxies (HyLIRGs), and the use of the number counts of these bright sources to constrain theoretical galaxy formation models (which in some cases have required significant alterations to fit the potentially erroneous counts). However, the current ALMA/SMA studies comprise just ~10 submm sources and so we propose short ALMA Band 7 continuum snapshots of 30 >10mJy sources from a new SCUBA-2 survey of the equatorial SXDF-UKIDSS/UDS field. These observations of a statistically significant sample will allow us to determine the average multiplicity of bright submm sources, derive the true form of the bright source counts (necessary to constrain models) and produce uncontaminated samples of real HyLIRG SMGs for study.',\n"," 'A systematic Characterization of the Outflows at Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud. While essentially all nearby ($<$ 200 pc) star-forming regions (Ophiuchus, Lupus, Chamaeleon, and Taurus) have already been surveyed by ALMA in the continuum, a systematic identification and characterization of their molecular outflows is yet to be done. The Ophiuchus molecular cloud is particularly well suitable for such an study as it contains a large number of embedded sources. Using ALMA archival data available for the entire population of young stellar objects in the cloud, we have identified a total of 20 new molecular outflows associated to Class I to Flat spectrum sources. Here we propose a Band-6 project to characterize the morphology and dynamical parameters of the new identified outflows. This will result in the first systematic demographic study of outflows at high angular resolution in a nearby molecular cloud and associated to Class I to Flat spectrum sources, which will help to put into context the many studies of individual outflows already present in the literature.',\n"," 'Clarifying CI distribution in molecular cloud by absorption observation toward compact quasars behind the Milky Way. We propose to perform [CI] absorption observations toward two compact quasars, J1851+0035 and J1935+2031, behind the Milky Way (MW). High-resolution ALMA beam toward QSOs can reveal the internal structure of a molecular cloud in the MW at a scale of ~100AU. Many observations found that [CI] distributions are similar to those of CO against the prediction by the classical photo-dissociation region (PDR) model. A model that molecular cloud consists of many clumps so as UV radiation can penetrate into the cloud, called clumpy PDR model, is suggested, although being unproven. Recent ALMA observations revealed that molecular clouds traced by CO are composed of many small clumpy structures. Investigating the consistency of the spectral features between [CI] and CO and PDR probes, we will reveal [CI] structure and UV effect within a molecular cloud so as to verify the clumpy PDR model. Unless we found the consistency, the effect of turbulence or chemical evolution should be considered.',\n"," 'The prospective circumplanetary disk around an accreting circumbinary planet. The combination of sub-mm interferometry with ALMA and high-contrast imaging at visible/infrared wavelengths has opened up the door to study the process of planet formation while it is still ongoing. One prominent example is the PDS 70 system, where the b and c planets have been associated both with strong hydrogen-line emission from MUSE and with point-source counterparts in ALMA, both implying the presence of circumplanetary accretion disks. Recently, very strong hydrogen-line emission has been observed from the circumbinary planet 2M0103 (AB)b. Since the intrinsic properties of the emission are very similar between 2M0103 (AB)b and the PDS 70 planets, their disk properties may also potentially be very similar. Here, we propose ALMA band 7 observations of 2M0103 (AB)b, in order to detect and possibly spatially resolve the disk of an accreting circumbinary planet for the first time. The unique proximity at 47.2 pc and strong evidence of accretion for 2M0103 (AB)b makes it by far the most promising known candidate for detailed studies of the late stages of planet formation and the circumplanetary environment.',\n"," 'Bulge Formation in Star-forming Galaxies at z>2. We propose to conduct 0¥arcsec.16 resolution dust continuum (350GHz) imagings of 14 star-forming galaxies at z>2 which has been identified by narrow-band surveys with Subaru Telescope in SXDF-CANDELS field. The targets are very suitable for ALMA cycle-2 capabilities because the feasibility is carefully estimated from their MIPS 24um and AzTEC 1.1mm data. Their rest-frame UV/optical images have already been obtained by WFC3/ACS on HST. ALMA is the only instrument which can provide us with such high-resolution submm maps. Combining the rest-frame far-infrared images by ALMA with the rest-frame UV images by HST, we aim to resolve the internal distribution of star formation activities including both dust obscured and unobscured ones and identify the mode of star formation such as ``burstiness and ``dustiness in each resolved region or clump for the first time. Our question is, ``where are new stars being formed within high-redshift galaxies?. This could be closely related to formation of bulges and disks. With the extensive high-resolution data-set, we will confirm the epoch of bulge formation and address this issue.',\n"," 'A large sample of MS galaxies with CO detections at 3<z<4. CO detections are crucial to probe the molecular gas in normal star-forming galaxies, where most of the star-formation in the Universe takes place. Since Cycle 3, we started a campaign to detect mid-high CO transitions in normal star-forming galaxies in the Early Universe: to maximize ALMA efficiency, we target galaxies already detected at sub-mm wavelengths by ALMA and with reliable spectroscopic redshifts. With our Cycle 3-4 program we detected two CO transitions in 5 main-sequence star-forming galaxies at 3',\n"," 'A 5-pc-scale study of molecular clouds in the Antennae. In the current CDM framework, galaxies are thought to grow through mergers from gas-rich starburst galaxies to large quiescent galaxies. The obvious important step in characterizing the merging process is to observe nearby merging galaxies. The Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/4039) are one of the nearest and the most famous merging galaxy pair. We propose to observe CO(10) emission from this galaxy pair with 0.05 arcsec resolution (5 pc) to see molecular cloud properties.',\n"," 'Hunting For Companionship: Constraining the Close Binary Formation Mechanism in Orion Protostars. A significant fraction of all main-sequence star are found in binary/multiple systems, and this high fraction of multiplicity must manifest itself during the star formation process. Using ALMA in Cycle 3, we surveyed 331 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds at 0.08\" (30 AU) resolution at 0.87mm and we have obtained complementary data with the VLA at 9mm toward the 102 youngest, Class 0 protostars. From this complete sample, we have identified 40 close multiple systems with companion protostars separated by < 500 AU, in addition to more widely separated companions. Close companion protostars are thought to form either directly at these < 500 AU scales via disk fragmentation, or they form on ~1000 AU scales via turbulent fragmentation and migrate. With this sample of 40 close multiples, we aim to determine the dominant mechanism for the formation of close companion stars by searching for Keplerian circum-multiple disks and aligned outflows toward these systems. This survey of a complete sample of close protostellar multiples in the most populous nearby star forming region will provide a definitive answer to the question of how most close multiple systems form.',\n"," 'Resolving Water Emission in the Early Universe. We propose to image water (988 GHz) and infrared luminosity in three strongly-lensed starforming galaxies at z~3 from the SPT survey. With the aid of gravitational lensing, we will achieve kpc spatial resolution in the source plane in Bands 6 and 9 with 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution. This will be the first time the L_H2O/L_IR correlation and dust temperature will spatially resolved in galaxies at high redshift. These observations will provide a powerful constraint on the kinematics of the FIR field and help understand the relation between star formation and star formation potential at high redshift.',\n"," 'Pilot CO survey of nearby spiral galaxies with ALMA. We propose a pilot wide-field CO(1-0) mapping survey of nearby spiral galaxies at 200pc resolution with ALMA. The immediate goal of this pilot project is to apply the offset method, which derives the pattern speed and star formation timescale simulataneously by measuring offsets between CO and H-alpha. Using CO maps from existing surveys, we derived these two parameters for five northern spiral galaxies. Furthermore, we found possible correlations between the star formation timescale and other physical parameters such as gas column density and metallicity, which suggest the self gravity of molecular clouds and metal line cooling be a major driver of star formation processes. New CO maps of southern spiral galaxies will enable us to asses if these correlations are real or not, and thus provide important information on mechanisms controlling star formation. In addition, derived pattern speeds will help to understand the nature of the spiral structure in target galaxies. In future cycles, we plan to extend this project to a large survey of ~100 nearby galaxies. ALMA is the only instrument that can perform such a large and wide-field mapping survey with high resolution and sensitivity.',\n"," 'Protoplanetary Disk Evolution in Spatially Resolved Pre-Main Sequence Binaries: Chamaeleon I. Stars frequently form in binary systems. Our observational knowledge about the evolution of protoplanetary disks in binary stars, however, currently leaves many questions unanswered. For example, while theory predicts how the sizes of circumstellar disks are truncated in the presence of a binary companion, an observational confirmation is still required and the impact of truncation on the evolution of the inner disks is unknown. We propose to acquire high-angular resolution band 7 continuum observations of 26 binary stars in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. The inferred disk masses and sizes will be correlated with stellar and binary parameters from our extensive near-IR binary investigations of the target sample. This is the first study dedicated to measuring the correlation of hot inner disk material and cold outer dust around binary star components to investigate whether the evolution of a truncated binary star disk is significantly different from that of singles. It will triple the current amount of data to observationally test the theoretically predicted truncation radii of disks in binaries, with many applications in the fields of star and planet formation.',\n"," 'The interplay of magnetic fields with expanding HII regions and its effect on triggered star formation.. Feedback effects regulate the process of star formation, favoring the formation of new stars (triggered star formation) or inhibiting it. Among the different sources of feedback, the expansion of the HII regions around the newly formed massive stars is one of the predominant processes. It has been shown by theory and numerical works that HII regions should have a major impact on the magnetic field features and, in turn, that magnetic fields should have a strong impact on the expansion of the HII regions, and on the formation of new stars. In the present proposal, we want to observe 3 HII regions developing together in the W33-Main clump, at 2.4 kpc from the sun. At large scale, we want to determine the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the expansion of the HII regions, as theory predicts they should be related. At small scale, we want to evaluate the effect of the expansion of HII regions and of the magnetic field features on the formation of second-generation stars.',\n"," 'Unveiling the Gas Phase Kinetic Chemistry in Protoplanetary Disks. ALMA images of CCH and C3H2 emission in two disks show clear evidence for an emission ring. These rings naturally arise in a disk where the ice-coated dust mass is spatially stratified with a surface and outer disk dominated by UV photons. We also esimtate that the C/O ratio is > 1 in this same gas with a rich kinetic chemistry. We propse to use ALMA to characterize this chemistry in TW Hya. (1) Using our chemical model as a guide we will search for the presence of additional hydrocarbons to characterize the extent of the chemistry. (2) Via observations of 13CCH we will measure that 12C/13C ratio which can provide clues to the source of carbon for the chemistry. (3) To obtain a deep observation of 13CO J = 2-1. These observations will be opitmized to detect and characterize the outer disk beyond the edge of the hydrocarbon emission ring which requires either a reduced total gas mass or total carbon. This gas has long been detected via 12CO emission and we aim to disciminate between these two scenarios. In all this program will characterize the active chemistry which is likely fundamental and evolving in all disk systems.',\n"," 'DEATHSTAR: The S-type stars. Mass loss by a stellar wind is a decisive process for late stellar evolution. Through this wind, Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are major contributors of synthesized elements and dust to their surroundings. The wind process is studied using hydrodynamical models with the goal of developing a predictive theory of AGB mass loss. The most reliable method to measure mass-loss rates is through CO line observations, but further progress in this fundamental field is still limited by the large observational uncertainties, where the assumed size of the CO envelope is a major factor. The DEATHSTAR project aims to solve this problem by directly measuring the CO envelope sizes. Data has already been collected for 50 M- and C-type AGB stars. To fully reach the project goals we propose to observe a sample of southern S-type AGB stars in CO(2-1) and (3-2) emission using the ACA in stand-alone mode. With this data we will develop the most accurate description of AGB mass loss to date, uniquely determine the gas-to-dust ratios of the sources, and through the large bandwidths covered in band 6 and 7, provide a goldmine for legacy science for the evolved star science community.',\n"," 'The highest resolution imaging of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect at z~1. We propose Band 3 observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) toward a distant galaxy cluster RCS J2319.8+0038. As the most massive object in a supercluster at z=0.90, RCS J2319.8+0038 has been detected at high significance in both an SZE survey by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and an optical survey by Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). The ACT data suggest a significant positional offset of the SZE signal from the X-ray peak measured by Chandra, whereas the HSC data point to complex distribution of member galaxies. We aim at i) revealing the dynamical status of RCS J2319.8+0038 by measuring the offset accurately and detecting (if present) shocks, ii) mapping the projected gas pressure and reconstructing the inner pressure profile, and iii) measuring the temperature profile in conjunction with the existing X-ray data. This will be among the first such measurements at z~1 and can only be accomplished by deep ALMA observations.',\n"," 'Do more evolved T Tauri disks have magnetic fields like HL Tau?. To date, only one T Tauri star has been detected in polarized dust emission (HL Tau, the brightest T Tauri disk) but at a lower fractional polarization than expected (average of 0.9%). The inferred morphology of the magnetic field in HL Tau is consistent with a toroidal field, but more circumstellar disk examples are necessary to understand the importance of the magnetic field in disks. Other studies have attempted to measure the inferred magnetic field in other T Tauri disks but not at the same sensitivity (only placing limits that would not have detected HL Taus polarization). To further understand the magnetic field in T Tauri stars and its effect on accretion and evolution, we propose to use the unique polarization capability of ALMA to measure the inferred magnetic field in three of the brightest T Tauri disks to a higher sensitivity than HL Tau (0.3% 3-sigma fractional polarization). With these data we can determine if polarized dust emission is common in other T Tauri stars, constrain the magnetic field morphology to determine if toroidal or poloidal fields dominant, and reveal any evolutionary differences in the small sample of inferred magnetic fields in disks.',\n"," 'Study of a bow-type structure of Venus atmosphere discovered by the Venus Climate Orbiter, AKATSKI. The Venus climate orbiter, AKATSUKI, entered an elliptical Venusian orbit on December 7, 2015 and discovered a mysterious steady bow-shaped structure extending north-south direction at the longwave infrared (LIR; 10 m) band on December 9, 2015. To understand the following, what happens in the bow-shaped structure;the influence of the bow-shaped structure on the spatial and temporal variation of temperature and minor constituents of the atmosphere of Venus; and how the bow-shaped structure are linked to physical and chemical atmospheric phenomena such as super-rotation, day-to-night circulation, Hadley circulation, and chemical network reactions, we propose to perform the Target of Opportunity (ToO) observation of CO, SO2, SO, and HDO spectral lines with ALMA as soon as AKATSUKI detects the bow-shaped structure again.',\n"," 'Protolunar disks around directly imaged young exoplanets. The gas giant planets of the Solar System are surrounded by moons in large quantities, with at least 50 prograde moons thought to have formed in situ. Just like the Sun is not the only star surrounded by planets, it is very likely that extrasolar gas giant planets are also surrounded by lunar systems. Building on the properties of the solar system moon systems, we derive models for minimum-mass protolunar disks, which are essentially scaled-down versions of the minimum-mass solar nebula. Using 3D radiative transfer, we show that such late circumplanetary disks would be readily observable given the incident flux from the central host star, and might even be brighter if heated from the giant companion they are surrounding. We propose to test our predictions by observing three confirmed companions around nearby young (<30 Myr) stars (PZ Tel, And and AB Pic) with ALMA in Band 6 continuum and 12CO J=2-1. Given our simulations, protolunar disks around these companions should be detectable at >10 sigma in just a few minutes on source.',\n"," 'The ionisation fraction in embedded outflows: TMC1A. Outflows from young stars are ubiquitous in star formation. Indeed, in the current paradigm, they are an expected natural consequence of star and disk formation. It is natural to then ask why, where, when outflows exist and how they function. Although the why (angular momentum removal) is well-understood, and ALMA has recently helped answer where and when, the how still remains heavily debated. It is well-established that outflows from young stars are magnetically-driven. One of the fundamental parameters that controls the launching is then the ionization fraction (which sets the coupling between gas and mag. field). We propose to derive the value and spatial variation of the ionization fraction on scales of ~5-200 au in the outflow of TMC1A. We will target HCS+ and H3O+, which are direct tracers of the ionization fraction. By combining these observations with chemical+magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we can provide a direct link between observations and physical conditions in outflows. This will allow us to draw conclusions on how efficiently the TMC1A outflow is extracting angular momentum, and if the outflow is affecting the structure of its parent disk.',\n"," 'Chasing molecular outflows in local Seyferts with the deepest ACA CO observations. Molecular outflows are thought to be the dominant component by mass in galactic winds. Their detection statistics in Seyfert galaxies remains, however, very limited. The possibilities to explain this are the following: i) The sensitivity of current observations is not sufficient to detect them, especially in weaker sources as Seyferts; ii) Molecular outflows are actually absent in most cases and represent only a rare phenomenon; iii) An important fraction of molecular outflow emission is diffuse and is resolved out in 12m array observations, that are only sensitive to small-scale clumpy emission. We propose unprecedentedly deep (10h exposure time per source) ALMA ACA 7m observations of 8 nearby (<40 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies aimed at detecting molecular outflows from broad wings of the CO(2-1) line. We will be sensitive to outflow masses as low as 5*10^4-10^5 solar masses and recover diffuse emission in the outflow, if present. The matching with existing VLT/MUSE optical data will provide the total (molecular+ionised) outflow mass and energetics, that will allow to assess the impact of outflows on their host galaxies and compare with predictions from feedback and outflow models.',\n"," 'Outflow structure and origin of the high-J CO excitation processes toward low-mass embedded protostars. Our recent Herschel results reveal highly rotationally excited CO emission lines toward a sample of young low-mass embedded protostars, which we can reproduce with radiative transfer models that require a combination of two thermal gas populations dominated by UV- and shock-heating processes. Spatially and spectrally resolved observations are needed to test our predictions for how the outflow structure and conditions within the outflow cavity and along the walls agree with the relative contribution predicted for each heating mechanism, as well as to explain the variation in high-J CO emission seen across the sample. In addition, new models show how a single temperature gas component may also be sufficient to describe the high-J line emission. We propose to observe the CO (2-1) and (6-5) line emission toward 7 of our Herschel embedded sources in order to examine the validity of both models and to determine the relationship between the main excitation mechanisms and the outflow structure and source evolutionary stage. Our source sample consists of 2 sources characterized by shock-heating, 2 sources dominated by UV-heating, and 3 sources by a combination of the two processes. By probing the (6-5) line in Band 9, we bridge the (rotational) energy gap between the cold gas probed by existing interferometers and the (unresolved) warm gas components revealed by Herschel, for the first time. Our goal is to verify whether the spatial distribution and the ratio of the integrated line intensities match up with the model predictions. This project will target the physical interaction region of the outflow with the envelope, providing insight into how energy is returned to the interstellar medium during star formation, and assessing how well our emerging outflow picture describes the full CO ladder and the physical origin of the excitation processes required to produce the high-J CO lines observed by Herschel.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas Dynamics of a Dual-AGN Cadidate - W2332-5056. We propose to study the molecular gas dynamics within the central 20 kpc of a recently discovered super massive black hole binary candidate W2332-5056 at z=0.3447. A total 2.11 hour, single pointing ALMA observation in band 6, will allow us to probe CO(3-2) kinematics and distribution in the central host, but notably capture the dynamical actions within the central kpc. The observations will provide inimitable dynamical information to test the elusive and rare super-massive AGN binary hypothesis for this system.',\n"," 'Probing magnetic fields in the inner envelopes and outer disks of Class 0 protostars. We propose ALMA Band 7 dust polarization observations of 3 Class 0 protostellar cores in Serpens in order to infer the magnetic field (B-field) morphologies in their inner envelopes (0.36\" resolution) and outer disks (0.08\"). Recent ALMA Band 6 Stokes I data show fragmenting filamentary structure near all of the sources, suggesting that B-fields play an important role in the shaping of structure, the formation of multiple-star systems, and possibly the fragmentation of massive disks (in the case of Ser-emb 6) down to <100 AU scales. With the observations we propose, (1) we will definitively answer the question of whether B-fields are toroidally wrapped by envelope and/or disk rotation, (2) we will be able to investigate the role of B-fields in filament and multiple-star formation at the smallest scales ever observed, and (3) for the first time, we will be able to characterize the B-fields role in the fragmentation process in a massive, gravitationally unstable disk.',\n"," 'Completing a Census of Cloud-Scale ISM Structure in Low Mass Disk Galaxies. We propose to complete a program mapping the molecular ISM of disk galaxies in which ALMA already invested ~11 hr of 12m, ~40 hr of ACA, and ~100 hr of TP time during Cycle 3. Mapping molecular gas at cloud scales (~50 pc) while sampling a diverse range of environments is necessary to understand how the lifecycle of GMCs, the efficiency of star formation, and the coupling of feedback depend on local and global conditions, and affect the evolution of galaxies. We are producing CO(2-1) maps of 18 nearby star-forming disks at ~1 resolution. The low mass targets are sufficiently CO-bright to efficiently map molecular gas (in contrast to dwarfs) and contain diverse dynamical, chemical, and stellar environments which differ from the conditions in high mass systems. ACA+TP data for the full sample, and 12m-array data for 12 galaxies are in hand. A 10 hr investment of 12m-array time is now necessary to complete this unprecedented high resolution census of molecular gas in low mass disks. Exploring gas, star formation, and feedback at this resolution over this range of environments will produce a unique legacy dataset, especially when combined with in hand data for high mass systems.',\n"," 'Core Mass Function of the Galactic Center 50 km/s Molecuar Cloud. In recent two decades, the young and highly luminous clusters in the Galactic center region, including Arches cluster, Quintuplet cluster, and Central cluster have been found by IR observations. The molecular clouds in the region are much denser, warmer, and more turbulent than disk molecular clouds. They are presumably the cradles of these bright star clusters. It is, however, an open question as to what mechanism is responsible for the formation of such star clusters in the cloud. The Galactic center 50 km s-1 molecular cloud is a most promising test bed to study of the star formation mechanism in the region. The core mass function of the clouds (CMF) is believed to be important for diagnosis of the star formation even in the Galactic center region. We propose multi-spices (CS, C34S, C33S, thermal SiO, H13CO+ and H42α) and wide-field imaging observations covering the whole cloud with mosaic method using ALMA to derive the CMF and size spectrum and to examine their positional deference in the cloud. This may be a key information to understand star burst phenomena as an elementary process.',\n"," 'Unveiling chemical compositions of high-mass star-forming cores in low metallicity galaxies. Interstellar chemistry in low metallicity environments is crucial to understand chemical processes in the past universe. Prior to this proposal, we conducted spectral line surveys toward molecular clouds in nearby low metallicity galaxies, LMC and SMC, with single-dish telescopes. As a result, we found that molecular clouds in LMC experience chemical processes different from those in our Galaxy. However, the beam size of single-dish telescopes (5-10 pc at LMC) is too large to resolve internal structures of molecular clouds, and emission from star-forming cores (~0.1 pc), which reflect the chemical compositions of molecular gas associated with newly formed stars, is almost diluted out. Here we propose ALMA band 6 and 7 spectral line observations toward high-mass YSOs in LMC/SMC to unveil the impact of low metallicity environments on chemistry of star-forming cores. This proposal should elucidate a possible link between chemical properties of dense molecular gas and metallicity of the host galaxy. Furthermore, this program has potential to identify a hot molecular core in external galaxies, which should help understand chemical diversity of complex molecules in our universe.',\n"," 'Remote Detection of Organics in Enceladus Plume. Enceladus, one of Saturns major moons, is the source of a spectacular water plume originating from a global sub-surface ocean. This plume provides a unique opportunity to trace the composition of an underground water reservoir in the outer Solar System remotely. Excitingly, Cassini has measured high abundances of small organic molecules such as HCN and H2CO in the plume, suggestive of a rich underwater organic chemistry. Identification of salts and molecular H2 in the plume has drawn comparisons to the hydrothermal vent environments in Earths oceans. More detailed and confident characterization of the plume will be difficult, however, as the Cassini mission is ending and no additional flybys will be conducted. Additionally, there is a persistent worry that some of the organics Cassini is `measuring may be residual from Titan flybys. We therefore propose to use ALMA to obtain an independent data set securing the existence of the most detectable plume organic, HCN. In addition to providing unambiguous evidence of organics in Enceladus plume, detection of HCN will establish ALMA as a powerful instrument for remote monitoring of the plume composition and its temporal evolution.',\n"," 'Searching for the flow base of the disk wind in TW Hya. Disks around young stellar objects are the birthplaces of planetary systems and have typical lifetimes of a few million years. The lifetime of disks defines the timescale on which planet formation can occur. However, the process responsible for disk dispersal is not completely understood. A possible mechanism are photoevaporative winds, driven by the high energy radiation of the star (UV, EUV and/or X-rays). With this proposal we aim to observe an alternative tracer of disks winds, namely the Carbon monoxide ion (CO+). CO+ resides a the very bottom of the atomic layer and above the CO layer of the disk. The location of CO+ makes it an excellent candidate to observe the flow base of disk winds (in contrast to atomic line tracers originating in the uppermost surface layers). We propose to observe CO+ emission in the disk of TW Hya which shows an observationally confirmed slow ionized disk wind, aiming to detect the flow base of this wind and provide strong constrains on the radial and vertical extension of the flow and the wind mass loss rate.',\n"," 'Ionized and Neutral ISM Properties in \"Normal\" vs. Starburst Galaxies at z=5-6. Using the unprecedented sensitivity of ALMA, we have recently detected strong [CII] emission in the first significant sample of \"typical\" star-forming galaxies at z=5-6. These results indicate that typical galaxies ~1 Gyr after the Big Bang appear to have low dust content, but they contain significant amounts of gas, at perhaps low metallicity. This contrasts findings for massive starbursts at the same epochs, indicating a strong evolution of the ISM in typical galaxies between redshift 3 and 6. To investigate the properties of the ISM at such early epochs, we here propose to observe the [NII] 205um line towards three galaxies in our sample at z=5.3-5.7, spanning a factor of ~100 in star formation rate (including normal, Lyman-break galaxies, and the most distant unlensed starburst known). This will allow us to measure, for the first time, the ionized gas content and the neutral gas fraction contribution to the [CII] emission at such high redshift. We will be able to investigate if these properties change significantly with dust content and the level of star formation activity, providing critical insight into the processes that govern stellar mass assembly in the early universe.',\n"," 'Non-star-forming molecular gas in intra-cluster multiphase orphan cloud. We propose to map CO emission in the recently discovered multiphase gas \"orphan\" cloud which is far away (> 80 kpc) from any galaxy. It is projected about 800 kpc from the center of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 1367. It is the first and still the only known isolated \"intra-cluster\" cloud detected in X-ray, H-alpha and CO emission. The presence of abundant hot, warm and cold medium suggests a rich physics of gas mixing with the surrounding intra-cluster medium (ICM) is taking place. Recent MUSE IFU observations revealed a complex H-alpha morphology and a velocity gradient of 200 km/s. New IRAM 30-m observations of two regions in the cloud found 2e8 Msolar of molecular gas, constituting about 10% of the clouds total mass budget. Yet, only a very small amount of star formation was found in the cloud, indicating that the conversion of the molecular gas to stars is extremely inefficient. The cloud likely represents a late evolutionary product of a gas stripping event of a massive infalling galaxy. With the A1367 orphan cloud, we have a unique opportunity to study in detail stripped ISM far from its parent galaxy that has developed into an ICM inhomogeneity.',\n"," 'The quest for substructures in the early stages of protoplanetary disks. Disks in the early stages (Class 0 and I) of low-mass star formation are the precursors of well-studied more evolved protoplanetary disks (Class II). The latter show clear evidence of substructures, which could be induced by planet formation, as well as evidence of grain growth. A fundamental question is how early these processes begin and therefore, when and on what timescales planetesimal formation starts. We propose to image five bright sources in the dust continuum at band 3 and 6 at spatial resolutions of 8 au and 6 au, respectively. These sources cover evolutionary stages from the Class 0 to I phase, and have been observed at short/intermediate baselines by the FAUST large program. Our observations will determine: (1) prevalence and properties of early substructures; (2) spatial variations of the dust continuum spectral index, which is related to the optical depth and dust grain size distribution; (3) the radial profile of the disk emission which, by comparison with models, will help constrain the dust temperature for both disk and envelope, further improving FAUST determinations of the chemical composition that will be inherited by more evolved protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'Where does high-velocity water emission originate in protostellar systems?. Water emission as observed with Herschel toward nearly every low-mass embedded protostar traces very high-velocity gas, up to 50-100 km/s from the source velocity. This was a surprise, and we still do not understand the origin of this high-velocity water in outflows. The two leading hypotheses for where this emission originates is either in the protostellar wind itself, or in shocks along the outflow cavity walls. In either case, understanding the origin of this high-velocity emission will shed light on what drives outflows in embedded Class 0 sources. We propose here to address this fundamental question by mapping out a suite of molecular tracers at 50 AU resolution toward the most prominent source of high-velocity water emission, L1448-MM. These include H2O at 325 and 183 GHz, as well as CO 6-5. By extracting local excitation conditions (H2O lines) and chemical abundances (H2O and CO) we will discriminate between outflow models, thus addressing the key question above.',\n"," 'What lies outside super-Earth planetary systems?. We propose to image the debris disk of the nearby (8.5pc) main sequence G5V star 61Vir in band 7 at 1.08” resolution to determine the disk structure at a resolution ~5 times better than previous observations. This system hosts at least 2 super-Earth planets within 0.5AU, a configuration which is common (around ~50% nearby stars), but the origin of which defies explanation. We recently showed this system has a debris disk with peak brightness at 30-100AU, and that bright disks such as this are more frequently found around super-Earth systems (Wyatt et al. 2012). Little is known about what lies in the empty region 0.5-30AU which must hold clues to the origin and nature of systems with super-Earth planets. We will image the debris disk and use radial and azimuthal structures within its planetesimal belts to set constraints on planets at >0.5AU, not only their current masses and orbits, but also their dynamical history. In this way we will assess different models for the formation of super-Earth planetary systems. The proximity and sub-mm brightness of 61Vir makes it uniquely placed to test such models, and the premier laboratory for understanding the ubiquitous class of super-Earths.',\n"," 'A new solar system planet or brown dwarf discovered with ALMA?. Recent ALMA observations of the evolved star W Aql (2012.1.00524.S, PI Ramstedt) revealed a curious bright source (3 mJy/beam, detected at 7.5sigma-significance) in two subsequent epochs separated by 25 days. During this time, the source has moved by almost 6 arcseconds. At only 1 pc this would correspond to a velocity more than 400 km/s making a location nearer to the Sun more likely. We might thus have discovered a rather bright submillimeter source at sub-pc distance. No similar object has previously been observed. Keplerian rotation alone would put the object around 600 AU and a typical brown dwarf velocity would put it at only 0.02 pc. The most intruiging option is that ALMA has discovered a large planetary body or brown dwarf near the Oort cloud. We request ALMA DDT observations to confirm or reject this hypothesis.',\n"," '[CI] observation of the overlap region in the Antennae galaxies. Photon dominated regions (PDRs) are key regions in the study of the interstellar medium because they are the interfaces between molecular gas, where stars form, and the surrounding galactic medium. The Antennae galaxies provide a unique laboratory to study the PDR model that applies to an intense star forming environment which occurs over kpc scales. We propose the [CI] (1-0) observation of the overlap region of the Antennae galaxies using the 7m array of the ACA. The primary goal of this project is to investigate the spatial distribution and kinematics of [CI] and CO at a 300 pc scale and characterize the PDR model which is appropriate for an intense star forming region in the overlap region. An important application of the outcome of this project is the PDR modeling of high-redshift galaxies, whose characteristics of the PDR/ISM are now being intensively studied using ALMA. We will also derive the molecular gas mass from the [CI] intensity and compare to the same quantities derived from CO (1-0). This is the first attempt to reveal the distribution of [CI] emission in the overlap region, and a necessary step toward future high resolution observations.',\n"," 'A GMC Catalog for the Circumnuclear Disk of Centaurus A. In powerful radio-galaxies the properties of the circumnuclear disks (CND) from hundred parsecs down to the accretion disk are hitherto poorly understood. Centaurus A (Cen A) is by far the nearest (D = 3.8Mpc) and best studied powerful radio galaxy and giant elliptical (Israel 1998). Two of the main characteristic features of this source are (1)the high concentration of gas in the inner few hundreds of parsec forming a CND (Espada et al. 2009), and (2)the radio and X-ray jet/lobe structure which is powered by a putative super massive black hole (SMBH). We have already studied the emission of a whole suite of molecular lines (CO(3-2), CO(6-5), HCO+(4-3), and HCN(4-3)) towards the CND probing different density and temperature regimes and with angular resolutions of about 5 pc (Espada et al. 2017, see Fig. 1). Here we ask for follow-up CO(3-2) observations using the ACA to alleviate the missing flux problem in the 12m array CO(3-2) data, since we estimated that 50% of the flux was lost. By combining our previous data with the new ACA data, we will be able to build an unbiased GMC catalog. Preliminar results suggest that GMC properties are similar to those in our Galactic Center.',\n"," 'A Comprehensive View of Magnetic Fields around Young Protostars NGC1333 IRAS 4A1 and 4A2 (II). This is a continuation of our A-ranked Cycle 3 program on IRAS4A, where only one of the two science goals (Band 7 polarization) was observed. Here we propose to finish the other science goal and leverage the Band 7 polarization data to disentangle contributions to polarization from dust scattering and magnetically aligned grains with additional Band 4 observations. Measuring polarized emission from aligned dust grains have been the most efficient method to probe the structure of the magnetic fields in star-forming regions. However, recent theoretical and simulation work by Katoaka et al.\\\\ (2015) and Yang et al. (2016a,b) demonstrated that the polarization originated from scattering cannot be ignored in the protostellar disks. Surprsingly, dust grains grow big enough to produce significant scattering at ALMA Band 7. To distangle the contribution of polarization from scattering and dust emission, we request dust polarization observations at Band 4. In addition, we request to complete the unfinished science goal of our Cycle 3 program for the polarization power spectrum analysis to measure the relative importance of magnetic fields and turbulence.',\n"," 'A comprehensive study of methanol aborption toward PKS1830-211. We propose a comprehensive study of methanol in the unique z=0.89 molecular absorber toward PKS1830-211 by observing the strongest absorption lines of the molecule across ALMA bands. Methanol is the best probe of the cosmological invariance of the proton-to-electron mass ratio (mu) and PKS1830-211 is the sole intermediate-to-high-z source where methanol has been detected. Current constraints of mu-variation reach Delta_mu/mu < 6x10-7 (at 3 sigma) in this system but are affected by systematics. The new high signal-to-noise ratio ALMA observations will allow us to perform a multi-transition analysis and determine the physical and chemical conditions of the methanol gas. We will reach a limit of mu-variation similar or better than the best current limit, but with a robust handling of systematics related to methanol excitation, frequency-dependent continuum morphology, and time variability.',\n"," 'AGN feedback and molecular line flux ratios in infrared luminous dusty galaxies. We propose molecular line observations of nearby infrared luminous dust/gas-rich galaxies for which the relative energetic importance of AGN and starburst has been quantitatively well-calibrated through previous infrared spectroscopy. Using different feedback from AGNs and starbursts to the surrounding molecular gas, we aim to establish a reliable method to scrutinize optically elusive buried AGNs in dusty galaxies, based on bright molecular line flux ratios at the dust-extinction-free (sub)millimeter wavelength. Our pre-ALMA and ALMA Cycle 0 observations have shown that enhanced HCN emission is empirically an excellent AGN indicator, but its physical origin is unclear. We propose ALMA Cycle 2 observations of these well-calibrated galaxies, at multiple transition lines of HCN/HCO+/HNC, in order to clarify the physical origin (i.e., an HCN abundance enhancement or excitation effect). Our (sub)millimeter energy diagnostic method using bright molecular lines, once established, will have a large potential to understand the interplay between suparmassive blackholes and star-formation in distant infrared luminous galaxies, which are known to dominate the cosmic dust-obscured activity.',\n"," 'Dense, Warm Molecular Gas and Star Formation in CO Luminous QSO Hosts. Our CO(1-0) survey of z < 0.3 UV-excess PG QSO hosts has shown that at least 38% reside in CO-rich host galaxies. We propose 0.1\"-0.2\" resolution ALMA Band 7 observations of CO(3-2) emission from four PG QSO hosts previously detected in CO(1-0). This sample has been selected to be nearby (z < 0.2), have a declination < 15 degrees, and to have CO(3-2) redshifted to a frequency with good atmospheric transmission. The CO(3-2) line is an ideal diagnostic line for star formation; it traces the dense, warm molecular gas component associated with high mass star-forming regions in galaxies. With these data, we will (a) measure the compactness of the CO(3-2) emission and its distribution relative to stellar light, (b) determine if the radio emission from these QSOs is co-spatial with the CO(3-2), and thus associated with star formation, and (c) make use of the CO(3-2)-IR luminosities relation of starburst galaxies to estimate the host star formation rates. This survey turns the focus of our extensive QSO work over the past few decades directly to diagnosing their starburst properties.',\n"," 'A Complete Line Survey Observation in the 3-mm Band toward NGC 1068 for Diagnosing the Power Source in Galactic Nuclei. We propose to obtain high resolution images of molecular distribution from a complete line survey observation in 3-mm band toward NGC 1068. The chemical properties have been expected to be powerful astrophysical tools for the study of galaxies, because the molecular line observations of different galaxies allow us to study the effects of these different physical properties/activities on the molecular medium. So far, some groups have suggested that it is possible to diagnose power sources in dusty galaxies using molecular line ratios. It is the workable strategy to clarify the relationship between the physical properties and the chemical markers in nearby galaxies, in order to understand the power source of distant and dusty galaxies using the molecular lines. We carried out the line survey toward NGC 1068 with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. And also, our ALMA cycle-0 (PI S. Takano) and cycle-1 (PI S. Takano) proposals toward NGC 1068 in 3-mm band were accepted and we already received cycle-0 data. Therefore, we can combine these data and we will obtain the complete line survey toward NGC 1068 in 3-mm band.',\n"," 'Astrochemical ABCs - An ALMA Band 9/10 Chemical Survey of NGC 6334I. Recent ALMA observations by the proposers have revealed that the massive star-forming region NGC 6334 I is one of the richest and most diverse sources of chemical complexity in the galaxy, and may very well turn out to be a hot spot in the molecular universe. ALMA Band 7 observations indicate the presence of a variety of physical sources across evolutionary stages, including several hot cores. Here, we propose to leverage the power of ALMAs Band 9 and 10 receivers to operate in dual side band mode to conduct a full Band 9 and a pilot Band 10 astrochemical survey of this region with relatively modest time requirements. The resulting spectra will provide insight into the chemical differentiation by probing simple, light species not readily accessible at lower frequencies, rigorously constrain the excitation of complex organic molecules with a higher-energy anchor to existing lower-frequency data, and dig into the inner reaches of the brightest hot core with high-excitation probes of physical conditions. The resulting spectral line surveys will be made publicly-available.',\n"," 'Resolving the AGN circumnuclear region with submillimeter water masers using the long-baseline ALMA. Extragalactic water masers at 22 GHz are well-known probes of circumnuclear gases in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Whereas 22 GHz water masers are inverted over a wide range of physical conditions (e.g., kinetic temperatures of Tk=200-2000 K; n(H2)=10^8-10^10 cm-3), it is believed that submillimeter masers are even more strongly inverted under more restricted physical conditions (Tk > 1000 K), suggesting that the submillimeter masers are a promising tracer of regions that cannot be probed by the 22 GHz masers. We have detected 321 GHz water masers toward the Circinus galaxy and NGC 4945 in Cycle-0 ALMA observations, with the masers being unresolved on these shorter baselines. To explore the innermost circumnuclear region of AGN using masers, we propose the first direct imaging with ALMAs longest 3.7 km baselines (band-7) of the submillimeter megamasers toward the two nearby AGN, both of which host a Type 2 Seyfert nucleus. At the requested 60 mas angular resolution that yields 3 mas positional accuracy, corresponding to 0.15 pc (assuming D=10 Mpc) with an SNR of 10 detection, it may allow the angular distribution of the submillimeter maser spots to be revealed.',\n"," 'The effect of the massive stellar feedback across the Carina Nebula Complex. Previous successfull ALMA campaigns have allowed the study of the location, mass distribution, and kinematics of the small-scale fragments within massive star-forming clumps in two regions with very different physical conditions, the Southern Pillars and the Northern Cloud. We propose to expand this sample towards 10 regions in the Carina Nebula Complex using the ACA 7m in Band 3. This represents, to our best knowledge, the first survey of clumps at high resolution conducted in this extreme region of massive star formation. Detailed comparison of the distribution of the dense gas and the location of young stellar objects will shed light on the dependence of the star-formation threshold on the level of turbulence and external pressure in these clouds with different level of impact of stellar feedback.',\n"," 'Resolving the Kinematics of the High-velocity Gas in CO 0.02-0.02. CO 0.02-0.02 is a peculiar molecular cloud found at 5 Galactic east of Sgr A*. Its spatial compactness (d<5pc) and extremely broad velocity width (dV>100 km/s) put the cloud in the category of high-velocity compact clouds (HVCCs). The association of an arc-shaped cavity which encloses a group of point-like IR sources may suggest that CO 0.02-0.02 has been accelerated by a series of supernova explosions in the embedded stellar cluster. However, we recently noticed that the highest-velocity gas in CO 0.02-0.02 significantly deviates from the cavity and its kinematics can not be reproduced by the single expanding-shell model. This means that plural different processes have contributed to its formation. Here we propose to observe the central region of CO 0.02-0.02 in the CO 3-2 line with ALMA. The primary objective of these observations is to examine kinematical models in the vicinity of the highest-velocity gas. We suppose the kinematics of multiple expanding shells, orbital motions around a compact mass, and outflows from protostars. Elucidating the origin of CO 0.02-0.02 contributes to the understanding of whole HVCCs and of the origin of turbulence in the central molecular zone.',\n"," 'Anatomy of molecular tori of Seyfert galaxies. The ALMA images of the 10-20pc-size molecular torus in the Seyfert galaxy NGC1068 have revolutionized the canonical pc-scale torus paradigm of unified AGN theories, also showing the presence of a multiphase complex kinematics. We propose to complete the mapping of the CO(3-2) and HCO+(4-3) lines and the 870micron continuum emission in the circumnuclear disks (CNDs) of the 7 targets for which there are images obtained at 7-13pc using now a spatial resolution of ~2-4pc. This project will expand by an order of magnitude the number of AGN observed with a spatial resolution and sensitivity akin to those achieved in NGC1068. These observations will enable the construction of 3D morpho-kinematic models of the torus: to study Keplerian rotation, inflow and outflow motions; to compare with predictions of state-of-the-art radiation-driven wind models and simulations; to derive BH masses in a key range of the M-sigma parameter space; and to map the torus-CND connection for the feeding budget in a representative sample of AGN. This is a resubmission of two accepted yet not-completed proposals to image with unprecedented resolution the ~40pc-size molecular tori in a sample of nearby AGN.',\n"," 'Different fragementation modes of the Nessie filament towards massive clumps. Filamentary molecular clouds are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium. Massive filaments seen throughout the Galaxy typically host one or more massive clumps, which eventually will form stars. However, their role in accumulating mass in the sites of active star formation is presently poorly known. Fragmentation, the process of forming a series of dense clumps, is commonly seen along filaments, but the physical conditions defining the fragmentation pattern remain unknown. We select five regions with identified partially massive, star-forming clumps within the massive Nessie filamentary cloud to address this issue. We propose to observe the spine of these linear structures and the surrounding medium with the ACA to map their velocity field, looking for ordered mass flows along and across the filament. The large-scale environments of the regions represent two typical scenarios for star-forming filaments, quiescent and shocked. Characterising these conditions and studying the resulting gas motions will help to reveal the physical processes important in the early phases of star formation.',\n"," '1.1 mm Survey toward Distant Lensing Clusters of Galaxies. .We perform a gravitational lensing survey of Submillimeter Galaxies (SMGs) towards three distant clusters of galaxies selected from our ASTE/AzTEC observations. We will cover a total area of 10 arcmin^2 down to the 1 sigma sensitivity of 0.13 mJy at wavelength of 1.1 mm. The mean lensing amplification factor over the entire fields is about 7 and allows us to reach, on average, intrinsic fluxes of ~0.07 mJy at the 4 sigma significance, comprising effectively the deepest survey ever archived at this wavelength. The expected number of detections are 10-20 depending on the underlying source counts of SMGs. This will not only enhance the current sample of lensed SMGs detected with ALMA by a factor of 2-3, but also provide a useful probe on its faint-end shape at ~0.1 mJy. Once combined with existing single dish data from ASTE/AzTEC, the data will further provide us the first source-free Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZE) increment images of galaxy clusters.',\n"," 'The Home Straight - Completing the CO Redshifts of Herschels Brightest SMGs. These observations are the final step towards finishing the redshift catalogue of 207 bright, high-redshift Herschel sources (S500 > 80 mJy, z_phot > 2). Extensive redshift searches have already robustly identified 77% of the redshifts, and using all knowledge up until now, we propose efficient ACA observations to find the redshifts for the remaining 48 galaxies using Bands 3, 4, and 5. Sample completion will enable efficient and unbiased spectroscopic follow-up across all sources, and provide a complete picture of cosmic star-formation seen by Herschel at the peak of cosmic evolution. These final observations of 48 galaxies require 124 hours, and fall in three separate categories: 1) we efficiently target lines to resolve redshift-degeneracies; 2) we observe fainter galaxies with deeper integrations; and 3) we cover the redshift desert for sources with deep integrations that did not reveal any line signatures. This project marks the completion of our study of the most intensely star-forming environments detected by Herschel, and will help trace rare populations (HyLIRGs, protoclusters, ...), enable a high-quality composite spectrum and will even allow for cosmological tests.',\n"," 'Collision-induced Star Formation in the Milky Ways Central Molecular Zone. Cloud-cloud collision is proposed to be an efficient process to form high-mass stars and their clusters, which may be particularly important in the extremely dense environment of the Milky Ways central molecular zone (CMZ); several localized starburst activities and the argued top-heavy initial mass function within the CMZ may result from frequent cloud-cloud collisions there. The presence and efficiency of the collision-induced star formation (SF) has been an issue of controversy, but we recently discovered a clear signature of collision in the cloud CO-0.30-0.07 in the CMZ; our ALMA/ACA data detected a pair of clumps contacting at a well-defined interface and a linear C18O filament just behind and parallel to the interface. Furthermore, our observations are so far consistent with the primary predictions of the collision-induced SF theory: formation of multiple filamentary structures and core-like features. We propose to conduct a higher-resolution imaging toward the cloud, in order to detect self-gravitating objects capable of forming stars and investigate the core-mass function, and thereby find the first unambiguous evidence for collision-induced SF.',\n"," 'How massive are the proto-planetary discs in Cygnus OB2?. ALMA is conducting many surveys of proto-planetary discs, but targeting nearby star forming regions. This biases our knowledge of disc masses and of the impact of the environment since those regions contain either none or only a handful (as in the ONC) of massive OB stars. We propose to use the extreme sensitivity of ALMA to survey the discs in Cygnus OB2, the closest massive star forming region to us (1.4kpc), containing 100s of OB stars. It is ideal to study the impact of extreme photoionising environments on protoplanetary discs due to its well-studied low-mass population and a thorough characterisation of the high-mass population and the associated UV field. ALMA is the only instrument capable of conducting this survey in a reasonable time. We will 1) compare the disc masses obtained with those in nearby star forming regions 2) search for a correlation between the disc mass and the stellar mass, which our models predict to be much steeper than in nearby regions 3) search for correlations between the disc mass and the UV flux received from the massive stars. Our program will characterise disc evolution in an environment completely different from those explored so far.',\n"," 'SPT z=4-7 protoclusters: cluster membership and dynamics from line observations. From the SPT 2500deg^2 survey, we have uncovered a complete sample of 9 massive protoclusters at z=4-7, appearing as the most luminous, unlensed structures in the survey volume. The protoclusters have spatially extended LABOCA contours, resolve into multiple sources with initial ALMA followup, show no lensing galaxy in deep optical/IR imaging, and exhibit large overdensities of LABOCA sources in the surrounding field. The proposal leverages our extensive results to date on SPT2349-56, which clearly appears to represent an actively and rapidly forming cluster core. This proposal is part of a coordinated effort to collect the required observations to prove that our complete SPT-PC candidate sample indeed traces the formation of the most massive structures in the Universe, and to provide the necessary observations for the full exploration of our survey. Here we focus on the 5 PC candidates for which we have ALMA redshifts. We propose to ALMA for deeper / wider followup to study their natures as distant, massive protoclusters. Our survey will provide an important baseline for models of the earliest massive galaxy cluster formation.',\n"," 'Dust trail of planet formation - measuring grain sizes in Ophiuchus. The question of when and how fast the dust grow is at the center of studies on star and planet formation. New state-of-the-art models and observations put in question paradigm that large > 1mm grains are ubiquitous in planet-forming disks. We need to understand what are the grain properties at the earliest stages of star formation process, and how fast the grain growth process occurs. This proposal will deliver the most robust constraints on dust sizes in young protoplanetary disks for all protostars in Ophiuchus. A efficient combination of archival and new data will deliver complete coverage at 0.9, 1.3, 2.1, and 3.2 mm for scales from 5 to 600 au in radius. This will lay a cornerstone for the next decade of developments of planet formation theory.',\n"," 'A search of the elusive sub-mm polarisation in protostellar disks. We propose to use ALMA in its narrow-field polarimetry mode to detect sub-mm polarized emission for the first time in a protoplanetary disk. ALMAs high resolution will avoid smearing out of the polarized signal, giving a 5x improvement in beam size and a factor of 100 improvement on the polarised flux over previous studies. The well-studied nearby disk HD163296 is ideal for this work, and we will image the polarisation out to a radius of 145AU to 0.3% rms, giving 60 vectors over the map and 12-15 vectors at the ALMA polarisation sensitivity limit of 0.1% (out to 100AU radius). The orientation and structure of polarisation vectors will allow us to pinpoint the grain alignment mechanism and the degree of alignment and grain non-sphericity. Even a non-detection will provide stringent limit on the shape of mm-sized grains, turbulent mechanisms hampering grain alignment and upper limits to alignment mechanisms. This is a resubmission of a Cycle 2 project (2013.1.00053.S) which was awarded time but no data has been taken, so far. Should the programme be executed in full in Cycle 2, it would not need to be repeated in Cycle 3, and we would withdraw the proposal.',\n"," 'Unveiling the First Short GRB Millimeter Afterglows with ALMA. Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are relativistic explosions which originate from the mergers of two compact objects (NS-NS/NS-BH). Such merging systems are also at the forefront of transient astrophysics, with the recent multi-messenger discovery of GW170817. Modeling of SGRB afterglow emission from the radio to X-ray bands provides a unique way to probe the burst basic explosion properties: the energy scales, circumburst densities, and jet opening angles. These properties not only provide critical insight into merger environments, but also serve as a vital baseline for comparison to properties inferred from future gravitational wave events. In the millimeter band, the faint and rapidly-fading afterglows of SGRBs require the sensitivity and dynamic scheduling of ALMA. Here, we propose to use ALMA TOO observations to identify and monitor, or place deep limits on the millimeter afterglows of 2 SGRBs in Cycle 7. Our proposed observations will be sensitive to SGRBs over a wide range of densities and jet opening angles. Our search will offer hundred-fold improvement over previous millimeter searches with other facilities, and any detections would be a milestone in SGRB studies.',\n"," 'Measuring Velocity Structure of MHD Wind from a Protoplanetary Disk with High Mass Accretion Rate. We propose to observe line transitions of CN and 13CO with high velocity resolution and high sensitivity to measure velocity structure of the MHD wind from a protoplanetary disk, making use of the PDR species (CN) line as a disk wind tracer and the 13CO line as a tracer of Keplerian rotation. The target object, the RU Lup disk, is almost face-on and active with a mass accretion rate of ~1e-7 M_sun/yr, an order of magnitude larger than that of the TW Hya disk from which we couldnt find a significant signature of disk wind in our previous observations. Recent MHD simulations suggest that angular momentum transfer and mass accretion in the disk surface will be induced by magnetized disk wind. The new global MHD simulations together with the detailed chemical model and radiative transfer calculations show that the difference in the maps of intensity weighted velocity dispersion between the CN and 13CO lines will give us clear evidence of the disk wind from the active disk. Our observations of radial wind velocity profile will be useful to reveal the wind mass loss rate, which is essential to understand gas dispersal from the disk and then planet formation processes.',\n"," 'The mass-loss rates of the most massive stars. We propose Band-4 and Band-6 continuum observations of the young cluster NGC 3603 to measure the mass-loss rates of its massive-star population (with all the objects at the same distance). We anticipate to detect several dozens of O-type stars, and we will measure their mass-loss rates in the most accurate way possible. We shall also derive the mm-fluxes and mass-loss rates of the 3 very massive hydrogen burning Wolf-Rayet WNh stars (A1, B, and C) that are present in the cluster center, and we shall test whether the theoretical predictions of an upturn in the mass-loss rates of optically thick winded WNh stars is confirmed. This would have important consequences for the evolution and fate of the most massive stars in the Universe. We note that ALMA is the only instrument with the required sensitivity and spatial resolution to carry out this project.',\n"," 'Do there exist mini-SMGs at cosmic noon?. We propose band-6 observations of six low-mass (Ms~10^9Msun) but red (UV slope >= -1.2) star-forming galaxies primarily selected from our large spectroscopic sample of z = 2.2 Lyman alpha emitters. SED fitting to their rest-frame UV to NIR photometry gives as high IRX=L(IR)/L(UV)~10 as of submm galaxies (SMGs), placing them well above the average IRX-Ms relation. In the literature, only one such miniature SMGs has been likely identified at cosmic noon because of faint dust emission. In this proposal, we will measure L(IR) for the six objects from dust continuum and derive dust-obscured star formation rates, SFR(IR), and dust masses, Md. High SFR(IR) and Md, if obtained as expected, will demonstrate that even low-mass galaxies, although not majority, experience dusty starburst, urging dust formation models to find a way to very efficient dust production in low-mass galaxies, which appears to be a more serious problem than the dust budget crisis of SMGs.',\n"," 'The rotating equatorial disk in the Red Rectangle. We propose high-resolution (extended configuration) ALMA observation of the Red Rectangle in 12CO and 13CO J=3-2 (simultaneously observed in band 7) and in 12CO J=6-5 (band 9). The Red Rectangle is a well known protoplanetary nebula (PPN) surrounding a binary star that shows spectacular images in the optical and IR. It is the only PPN in which an equatorial disk in rotation has been clearly detected, by means of CO J=2-1 and J=1-0 PdBI maps. Such disks are still poorly observed, although their study is basic to understand the post-AGB evolution and the shaping of planetary nebulae. Both phenomena are thought to be driven by the ejection of very fast and collimated jets during the first post-AGB phases, which are probably due to reaccretion of circumstellar material via a rotating disk (as in young stars). High-resolution ALMA maps of CO emission, including the high-excitation J=6-5 line (a good probe of the temperature in our case), will significantly improve our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the disk in the Red Rectangle. ALMA data will be combined with recently obtained Herschel/HIFI spectra of CO high-frequency lines. We will study in detail the distributions of density and temperature in the disk, including an accurate investigation of the origin of the evaporation of gas from the disk and a deep search for infalling gas in its inner regions. Because of the favorable conditions to the observation of this source and the expected spectacular results, we think that this project is very well adapted to the ALMA early science program.',\n"," 'Large dust particles in the peculiar comet C/2017 K2. The Oort cloud comet C/2017 K2 (hereafter K2) is remarkable for developing a coma at a record heliocentric distance of 35 au. The detection of K2 beyond the orbit of Uranus offers an unprecedented opportunity for us to examine the evolution of a pristine comet arriving into the inner Solar system from near-interstellar temperatures. The well-preserved dust and ice in this pristine comet holds valuable information about the physical processes during the formation of the Solar system. Our goal is to map the thermal emissions from large dust particles over four ALMA bands, 3, 4, 6 and 7 to yield strong constraints on the physical properties of millimeter-sized grains, which dominate the coma mass of K2, via dust modeling. The superb sensitivity of ALMA provides the only way to study the large particles of this comet. Taking advantage of ALMAs unique capability of observing dust and gas simultaneously, we will also observe CO and HCN emission lines of K2 in 3 ALMA bands and derive the dust-to-gas ratio of this comet. This study will shed light on our understanding of comet formation in our Solar system and possible disk processes for planet formation around other stars.',\n"," 'Thinning the rings: 3 mm observations of the multigapped disk of HD 169142. The recent discovery of multiple rings and gaps in protoplanetary disks has sparked a lot of interest since these substructures could work as dust traps, accumulating grains and enhancing their growth. However, several observations indicate that disk substructures are optically thick up to ~2 mm, which hinders our ability to study their role in the dust evolution process. We propose to observe the multigapped disk of HD 169142 at 3 mm with very high angular resolution, unveiling the optically thin emission of the disk with an extreme degree of detail. These data, together with other ALMA and VLA observations, will provide the most accurate resolved measurements of the spectral index in HD 169142 so far. We will test different gap formation mechanisms in the system and explore the possible dust trapping of large grains in disk substructures. Given the spectacular double ring morphology of HD 169142 and its variety of interesting features, this system is among the best laboratories to test our understanding of grain growth and planet formation.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas Mapping of the Node within the Cosmic Web at z = 3. Models of cosmological structure formation in a cold dark matter universe request that the matter in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the galaxies formed from it shape a cosmic web of walls and filaments. Recently we have found a promising candidate of such ongoing galaxy assembly along the IGM filament at the core of the z=3.1 SSA22 proto-cluster. Combining our 2x3 ALMA deep imaging with deep Lyman-alpha and X-ray imaging, we have found that at least 12 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and/or X-ray Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at z=3.09 are embedded in the filaments designated by the diffuse and extend Lyman-alpha emission. Here we propose a blind line scan using Band3 to uncover molecular gas reservoir at the core of the proto-cluster. Utilizing this molecular ALMA deep field, we will (i) measure CO luminosity functiona and the cosmic molecular gas mass density in the node of cosmic structure, (ii) unveil the link between molecular gas reservoir and cold intergalactic gas, (iii) uncover the environmental dependence on gaseous properties for various galaxy populations, and (iv) reveal how galaxies and super massive black holes (SMBHs) co-evolve in the proto-cluster core.',\n"," 'Constraining Ionization in a Diverse Sample of Protoplanetary Disks. Ionization is influential in shaping both physical and chemical structure in protoplanetary disks. However, ionization is poorly constrained in observed disks, with strong constraints towards only two sources, TW Hya and IM Lup. In both disks, it was found that ionization from cosmic rays is suppressed by two orders of magnitude, implying that coupling of disk material to magnetic fields may be too weak to explain angular momentum transport in this system. We propose a survey of ionization-tracing molecular ions towards seven physically well-characterized disks that will complement existing observations in the ALMA archive to place constraints on ionization in a diverse disk sample. In addition to verifying whether or not low CR ionization levels are typical, the proposed observations will have implications for the cold ionization-driven chemistry occurring in these disks, which governs the formation of water and complex organics, and will additionally supply realistic, observationally motivated ionization models for future disk physical modeling, namely magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.',\n"," 'Chemical evolutions of GMCs while crossing the spiral arm in the nearby galaxy M 83. Recent ALMA observations are unveiling the spatial variations in chemical properties of molecular gas in external galaxy disks, which might be useful to understand the evolutions of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) further because specific evolutionary stages of GMCs can be traced by specific molecular lines (and their ratios). We propose to observe molecular lines including 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0), CS(2-1), and CH3OH(2-1) simultaneously toward the spiral arm of M 83 in order to study the evolution of GMCs while crossing the spiral arm in terms of chemical properties. Since the CH3OH abundance could be enhanced by mild shock such as spiral shock waves, we expect to observe the high CH3OH/13CO ratio for unvirialized GMCs in the initial stage of the evolution. On the other hand, for evolved and virialized GMCs which have crossed the spiral arm, we expect to observe the increase in C18O/13CO and CS/13CO ratios and the decrease in CH3OH/13CO ratio because the dense-gas and massive-star formation occurring in such GMCs can enhance C18O and CS, but CH3OH is dissociated by UV radiation from massive stars. We will verify the chemical evolution of GMCs by cycle-4 observations.',\n"," 'Searching for PAHs in the Red Rectangle. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widely accepted as the carriers of the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), but an unambiguous identification of any specific interstellar PAH is still missing. Here we propose to close this gap and conduct a deep search for the high-J rotational transitions in corranulene (C20H10) - a symmetric, bowl-shape PAH molecule with a large dipole moment (2.07 D). Our selected target is Red Rectangle Nebula, a pre-planetary nebula which is the brightest source of AIBs in the sky and where a previous attempt to detect corranulene was unsuccessful due to limited sensitivity.',\n"," 'Dense Gas Thermometry of Starburst Galaxies. A characterization of the physical properties of the dense gas within the interstellar medium of starburst galaxies is critical to our understanding of their evolution. Many of the molecular tracers used to characterize the dense gas in star-forming galaxies suffer from a coupled degenerate sensitivity to the kinetic temperature and volume density. A molecular tracer which can decouple individual physical conditions is required. Results from a survey of a sample of active star-forming galaxies has shown that Formaldehyde (H2CO) is a reliable and accurate density probe for extragalactic environments where the kinetic temperature is known. Ammonia (NH3) is a traditional probe of the kinetic temperature in dense gas environments, but its utility requires an assumption of cospatiality between dense gas tracers is required. Using the unique sensitivities to kinetic temperature afforded by the excitation characteristics of several transitions of H2CO, we propose to continue our characterization of the dense gas in galaxies exhibiting starbursts by imaging the gas kinetic temperature in a representative pilot sample of three starburst galaxies: Arp220, NGC253, and NGC4945.',\n"," 'ALMA & MUSE synergy to explore the impact of AGN-feedback on the circumgalactic gas. Recent MUSE observations of a Broad Absorption Line (BAL) QSO at z~5, revealed a Lyman-alpha (Lya) nebula with high broadening of the line (FWHM~1500 km/s) in the inner region (~20 kpc) of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), almost doubling average values commonly observed around typical QSOs. This is likely to be associated to the BAL-nature of the object, which shows CIV absorption troughs blueshifted by more than 30.000 km/s, indicating high velocity outflows, that could inject energy and introduce significant turbulence on 10-kpc scales. These findings suggest a profound link between QSOs and the properties of their surrounding CGM. Here we propose deep Band-7 ALMA observations targeting the [CII] line over scales of ~60 kpc around the QSO. We aim to (i) observe the spatially extended outflow and the metal-rich quiescent gas reservoir in the CGM, and (ii) explore their connection with the observed properties of the Lya nebula. We will probe how powerful outflows can influence the morphology and the kinematics of the gas in the CGM on scales of (at least) tens of kpc around the QSO, adding novel, key information on the impact of AGN-feedback on the environment of AGN-host galaxies.',\n"," 'Revealing the secrets of VLA1623: an in-depth look into the earliest star formation stage. Multiple protostellar systems are common in the early stages of star formation. While fragmentation is agreed to be the main mechanism of formation, most of what is known comes from continuum observations but continuum alone can not answer the recurrent questions of multiple star formation: do all detected sources belong to the observed system? what are the relative evolutionary stages? what influence do companions have on each other? what is the dependence on the temperature structure of the core? In addition, of interest to star formation in general, is the formation of rotationally supported disks. Disks are crucial to star formation, but the question of when do they form and what enhances their formation still remains. VLA1623 is a triple non-coeval system in rho Ophiuchus which shows some interesting extremes in star formation: the youngest Keplerian disk and the coldest source. The proposed observations will help us to address the questions of early disk formation, source membership in a system and temperature structure of the cloud and its effect on disk formation and fragmentation.',\n"," 'Dynamical Masses of a Taurus Low Mass Star and Brown Dwarf. With ALMA observations combining high spatial and spectral resolution, we propose to observe an exceptional binary system in Taurus with two gas disks that we detected and resolved with Cycle 1 data. The binary pair is composed of a very low mass primary with a mass near the stellar limit and a faint substellar companion with a mass that may be as low as 10Mjup. These mass estimates are derived from comparison of photometry and evolutionary models, and there is a critical need to obtain empirical calibration of the evolutionary models with dynamical mass estimates. By mapping the kinematics of the two disks with ALMA, we propose to measure the masses of each component of the system and provide a benchmark calibration of the evolutionary tracks at a much lower mass than was possible previously. The mass estimate from the Keplerian motion of the companion disk will determine whether the object is genuinely planetary in mass or is an obscured more massive object. In addition to the spectral line maps, these observations yield a sensitive continuum map, from which we will compare the gas and dust disk radii and investigate the possibility of the dust disk having a sharp outer edge.',\n"," 'Determining the Nature of the mm Radio Emission from Active M Dwarfs. Quiescent radio emission from active stars in the 1-15 GHz frequency range was discovered in the early days of the VLA. Recent observations with the newly upgraded Jansky VLA have now confirmed the detection of a new, brighter, high frequency component (20-40 GHz) in the radio emission from two main sequence active M dwarfs that is stably present in multiple epochs. Determining the nature of this emission is crucial if the diagnostic potential of this new observing window is to be realized. One of these stars is the well characterized flare star UV Ceti. We propose to use ALMA to conduct a single 45 minute observation of UV Ceti to conclusively distinguish between gyroresonance emission and gyrosynchrotron emission as the mechanism responsible for this emission. This observation may open the possibility of extensive ALMA campaigns targeting the coronae of active stars.',\n"," 'The Hunters Gift: A Bounty of Forming Disks to Further Our Understanding of Protostellar Evolution. The formation of a protostar and its Keplerian disk remains a poorly characterized process, but ALMA now provides an opportunity for significant progress. These forming disks also hold the key to measuring the most fundamental parameter of newborn stars, their masses derived from the Keplerian disk rotation. The measurement of protostar masses and the properties of forming disks for large ensembles of systems is essential to solidifying our knowledge of star and planet formation. Our ALMA Cycle 3 survey of 330 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds at 0.13\" (50 AU) resolution yielded >100 well-resolved continuum images of apparent protostellar disks. We propose to observe a sample of 20 disk candidates around 10 Class 0 and 10 Class I protostars, drawn from a representative range of luminosities (0.4 L_sun to 480 L_sun). With these observations, we will confirm whether or not each disk is Keplerian, using molecular line tracers (primarily C18O J=2-1), measure the change in mass and mass accretion between the Class 0 and I phases, how much the disk properties depend on stellar mass, and how much disk structure evolves from Class 0 to Class I and later stages.',\n"," 'Spatially resolved 3 mm imaging line survey toward NGC 7469. We propose to conduct a line survey toward the central kpc region of the nearby type-1 Seyfert galaxy, NGC 7469, at 3 mm wavelength. This observation will be combined with our accepted cycle 1 program toward the same region, to fully cover 86-116 GHz range. From this observation, we will investigate the effect of AGN and starburst activity on the molecular materials. For example, we focus on the abundance variation of (1) HCN and CN, which are expected to be enhanced in AGNs, (2) molecules sensitive to UV radiation such as HNCO, which can be used to probe the phase of starburst activity, and (3) dust-related molecules such as SO, CH3OH, SiO, CH3CN, to investigate their properties especially in AGNs. All observed properties will be compared with chemical models and results of our ALMA cycle 0/1 programs toward NGC 1097, 253, and 1068, to further investigate the effect of AGN and starburst on molecular properties. In addition, NGC 7469 hosts a bright type-1 AGN whose Eddington ratio is comparable to QSOs. Therefore, this observation can also serve as a local template of molecular properties for exploring high-redshift QSOs in future ALMA cycles.',\n"," 'The mm Fundamental Plane of Black Hole Accretion of Stellar Mass Black Holes: Persistent Transients. A \"mm fundamental plane of black hole (BH) accretion\" has recently been discovered, analogous to the radio one. Its scatter is however much smaller (0.4 dex), nearly as small as that of the BH mass - stellar velocity dispersion relation. Surprisingly, it is also obeyed by all galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), with both high and low accretion rates, and is well explained by advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) models but not by classic geometrically-thin accretion disc models. This new mm fundamental plane thus provides both the most accurate proxy (i.e. indirect estimate) of BH mass and crucial new insights into BH accretion physics. However, it is as yet unknown whether stellar-mass BHs in accreting systems also follow this plane. This proposal therefore aims to i) ascertain whether stellar-mass BHs also follow the mm fundamental plane of BH accretion, by observing all known (and accessible) quasi-persistent transients (4 X-ray binaries), and ii) establish whether ADAF models also explain the mm fundamental plane of BH accretion of stellar-mass BHs, as they appear to do for AGN of all accretion rates.',\n"," 'Large-scale starburst activity in the Early Universe: Locating the fuel for star formation. We propose deep 7m+TP array observations of [C I] 1-0 emission towards two massive galaxy clusters at z>=4, where ALMA has demonstrated that extraordinarily intense starburst activity occurs in numerous (N>10) galaxies separated by hundreds of kpc. Existing interferometric data are insensitive to inter-cluster scale gas. The proposed observations will reveal the true extent of the gas supply fueling these starburst events. Combining the ACA data proposed here with archival 12m-array data, we will infer the mass of protocluster-scale molecular gas, and its distribution, searching for filamentary/tidal structures. The [C I] line can trace CO-dark gas, expected to be prevalent in protocluster environments where energetic particles influence the astrochemistry more than photons. Locating a massive, widely distributed gas reservoir via [C I] would resolve the puzzle of how numerous colossal starbursts occur simultaneously - as if coordinated - across hundreds of kpc. These observations represent the first step towards imaging the cold cosmic web at z=4 with ALMA, revealing crucial information on the fuel for star formation in the densest environments at early cosmic epochs.',\n"," 'Testing the mass complexity of massive elliptical galaxies with precision gravitational lens modelling and ALMA. Strong gravitational lensing is a well-established tool to probe the mass structure and dark matter distribution in galaxies. However, fundamental to these lines of research is the parameterisation of the large-scale mass distribution of the lensing galaxy, which is usually assumed to be an ellipsoidal power-law density profile with external shear. Several recent works highlighted the limitations of a power-law model and the impact this can have on the astrophysical applications of gravitational lensing, particularly in regard to testing dark matter models. Observations of lensed starburst galaxies with ALMA can provide the most detailed test of complexity, given higher angular resolution than current optical telescopes. Here, we propose to observe 12 lenses at 30 mas resolution. We will measure the angular complexity using both parameteric and non-parametric modelling, compare this to predictions of hydrodynamical simulations and characterise the systematic bias in lensing studies. Furthermore, this sample will be key to set up 10 mas observations in future cycles, which will provide fundamental tests of the nature of dark matter.',\n"," 'Exploring molecular clouds in the spiral arm region of M83 in [CI]. [CI] has been considered a global tracer of molecular gas as a substitute for CO on the galactic scale, whereas where and how it is emitted in the galaxy are not yet well understood. Recent [CI] observations toward M83 at ~400-pc scale revealed that the [CI] intensity is enhanced along the downstream and upstream regions of the molecular (i.e., CO) arm. The downstream enhancement suggests that [CI] is a photodissociation product of CO, whereas the upstream enhancement implies that [CI] appears bright in the earlier stages of the molecular cloud chemical evolution from CI to CO. Observations at GMC-scale (~50 pc) clarify the origins of [CI] enhancement in the arm. The resolution allows us to investigate the influence of UV radiation emitted from massive stars. It also permits detection of the spatial offset corresponding to the timescale conversion from CI to CO. We will investigate the dependence of the [CI]/CO ratio on the physical properties of GMCs by utilizing CO archival datasets. This study is the first to explore [CI] mapping to identify GMC-scale CI clouds directly in the disk of a nearby galaxy and serves as a benchmark for studying molecular clouds in [CI].',\n"," 'The nature of the IRAS16293-2422 outflow and its impact on protostellar chemistry. Outflows are crucial for star formation. One example is how they affect the chemistry by heating gas in accretion/ejection bursts. Evidence of such bursts are recorded in the large-scale outflow, that traces events from the past 10^3-10^4 years. Thus, outflows may serve as an interface between chemistry and protostellar evolution. One of the best studied low-mass protostars is IRAS16293-2422. The system consists of sources A and B, and these show markedly different chemical make-ups. This difference is interpreted as either the B source being more evolved, or it has recently experienced a burst but is currently quiescent. On small arcsec scales, B does not appear to drive a strong outflow but may have done so in the past. To connect the large-scale arcmin outflow to the small scales and map the outflow history, we propose to map the entire outflow with the ACA in CO 3-2 at a resolution of few arcsec, necessary to connect the spatial scales. This will provide the first evidence of bursts changing the chemistry of protostars, a result which is important for understanding the chemical composition of any protostellar system.',\n"," 'Measuring Extended Source Species in a Bright Apparition TOO Comet. Certain molecules observed towards cometary atmospheres have a physical distribution that cannot be explained as direct sublimation from the nucleus or gas-phase chemistry within the coma. The extended source of these species is not known. As part of a joint collaborative multiwavelength effort, we will conduct an observational survey of extended source species and their possible parent or related molecules in a target of opportunity comet. This study will image HCN, HNC, CO, H2CO, and CH3OH to compare distributions within a given apparition and to previous ALMA observations. These observations will help constrain the origin and extent of the distributed source for each species, the scalelength of the source, establish accurate molecular abundances, and provide insight into comet chemistry. These results will build off data in the four comets previously observed with ALMA. The target of opportunity comet should have Q(H2O) ~ 1e29 s-1 and may be a new dynamical object or a known apparition undergoing an outburst event. We propose to observe with either the 12m array or the ACA depending on the current array configuration at the trigger.',\n"," 'The Orcus-Vanth System: A Rosetta Stone for accretion in planetary systems. The dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt provide one of the most compelling cases of the breakdown of the simple theory of pairwise accretion. The formation of these large rock-rich dwarf planets through coagulation of the population of small low density near rock-free objects appears difficult. Alternative accretion theories predict a wide variety of behaviors of the size-density relationship through the small body-large body transition. The Orcus-Vanth binary system is uniquely suited to determining the density behavior through this transition and pointing to the accretion history of the solar system. The new higher resolution capabilities of ALMA in Cycle 4 allow us to use resolved thermal radiometry to measure the individual component sizes and, the unique capability of highly accurate relative astrometry over moderate angles will let us determine the astrometric wobble of Orcus induced by Vanth to measure the individual component masses, yielding simultaneous densities of two of these transitional objects and a chance to determine how solid bodies in planetary systems form.',\n"," 'Blowin in the Wind: the Properties of the Starburst-driven Wind in NGC 253. Using ALMA observations in cycle 0 we have imaged the starburst-driven molecular outflow in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 (Bolatto et al. 2013a). These observations demonstrated that the molecular outflow carries enough mass to substantially shorten the current star formation episode in this galaxy. It is unclear whether the gas can escape the galaxy, or only reach into the halo to be later recycled. To escape, the molecular gas needs to be accelerated, possibly through mixing with the faster ionized wind. This study will measure the extent of the CO emission away from the starburst, and the distribution of velocities in the molecular wind. It will also measure the acceleration, and provide further insight into the physical entrainment and mass-loading mechanisms of the outflow. Finally, the observations proposed here will allow us to refine substantially our estimate of the mass-outflow rate. Together, they will shed unprecedented insights in the fundamental properties of the nearest starburst galaxy accessible with ALMA.',\n"," 'Establishing OH+ as a robust outflow tracer for high redshift galaxies. We propose to establish the use of the OH+ lines as a robust outflow tracer in luminous high-z galaxies. The OH+ line displays pronounced P-cygni profiles in local ULIRGs, where the line is ubiquitous and about half as bright as CO lines, and as such should be an ideal outflow probe of high-z galaxies for ALMA. We target 5 gravitationally lensed high-z ULIRGs (3 at z=2-2.5, 2 at z=3-3.5), with spectroscopic redshifts and good magnification models, to test this method. We use a setup combining OH+ with the nearby CO(9-8) line, which provides a direct measurement of the velocity of any OH+ emission or absorption with respect to the bulk gas. We will measure outflow velocities as a function of position over the galaxies, pinpoint the origin of the outflow and assess the relation between outflow velocity infrared luminosity and surface brightness. Bright detections will be followed up at high resolution in a future cycle.',\n"," 'Hunting the possible main carrier of Phosphorus in star-forming regions: Phosphine (PH3). The detection of prebiotic molecules in star-forming regions allows us to better understand how the building blocks of life originate in the interstellar medium. However, among lifes key elements (CHNOPS), Phosphorus (P) is the least understood in terms of its ISM chemistry. ALMA observations of P-bearing molecules (PN and PO) towards the AFGL 5142 star-forming region suggest that, besides the role of shocks sputtering dust grains, photochemistry may also play a key role in P-chemistry. However, to confirm this scenario, there is an important missing piece, never detected in star-forming regions: phosphine (PH3). This species is expected to be formed efficiently on the surfaces of grains through hydrogenation of atomic P, and it can desorb thanks to shock-induced grain sputtering. Once in the gas-phase, PH3 can be converted to PO and PN by photochemistry induced by radiation from the star. Therefore, the relative abundance ratios between PH3, PO and PN will constrain the relative importance of shocks and photochemistry in the chemistry of P in star-forming regions. We thus propose to detect PH3 for the first time in a star-forming region.',\n"," 'Testing a New Mode for Cloud Collapse in Galaxy Centers. The vast majority of dense gas in the Milky Way is in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, central 500 pc of the Galaxy) and most of the star formation in the CMZ is confined to gas streams about 100 pc from the Galactic center. These gas streams are on eccentric orbits that pass by the bottom of the Galactic gravitational potential well at Sgr A*. Initial investigation suggests that pericenter passage by Sgr A* may induce tidally-driven compression of clouds and subsequent star formation further downstream. This new mode of cloud collapse could give us an absolute timeline for star formation, with t= 0 occurring at pericenter passage on the streams, a fourth dimension for studies of star formation. We propose to obtain maps of the most structured cloud approaching pericenter. We outline three testable predictions of the tidally-driven cloud collapse scenario, which precludes current active star formation in the cloud. The countervailing scenarios predict none of these signatures, and instead predict star formation activity. We will perform the first detailed observational test of cloud collapse by tidal compression where the influence of the tidal field is the strongest.',\n"," 'A high-resolution band-7 continuum survey of SMGs in the field of five SZE-selected galaxy clusters.. We propose to obtain band-7 continuum mapping at ~1 arcsec spatial resolution for a sample of 39 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) detected with LABOCA (~18\"/beam) in the field of five galaxy clusters originally detected through their Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect decrement signals at 148 GHz. The selected targets have 870 micron (345 GHz) flux densities ranging from 3.7 to 36.9 mJy, but our current photometric accuracy is compromised by blending of point source and extended SZE emission, and plausibly of multiple fainter SMGs within a single LABOCA beam. To secure detection of all targets and their possible sub-components at the 4 sigma level, we require a point-source sensitivity of 0.3 mJy. To achieve this observational goal, we require a total observation time of 2.2 hours including overheads.',\n"," 'Investigating the origin of an asymmetric dusty ring around CIDA 9. Rings and gaps are ubiquituous features in disks around young stars. It is thought that they are signposts of ongoing planet formation. In our previous survey, CIDA 9 shows an asymmetric dust continuum ring with a shadow in the north side of our millimeter image. We propose continuum observations in Bands 3 and 4 to detect dust continuum shifts for different dust grain sizes. In the case of planet formation, the models predict that the dust continuum at all of the Bands will be cospatial. The presence of a deadzone can be seen through a radial shift in the continuum peak emission while it is an azimuthal shift in the case of a vortex. The requested molecular lines observations will also help in ruling out photoevaporation as the physical agent that forms the transition disk. The combined dust and gas observations proposed in this program can definitevely differentiate between photoevaporation, vortex, giant planet and dead zone.',\n"," 'Study of microquasar SS433 as a cosmic-ray particle accelerator. PeVatron, the accelerator of the galactic cosmic-ray particles having the energy above 10$^{15.5}$ eV, is still not specified. Galactic X-ray binary jet is a prime candidate of PeVatron. Recent TeV gamma-ray observation showed a clue that the jet of the X-ray binary SS433 would accelerate cosmic-ray protons to a higher energy than 10$^{15.5}$ eV. To verify it, we propose the observation of molecular clouds, which are possibly the origin of the TeV gamma-ray emission induced by high energy cosmic-ray protons. This study should bring an essential breakthrough to determine PeVatron in our galaxy. We plan to verify whether the molecular clouds can be identified around the TeV gamma-ray emission. After that, we investigated the detailed spatial and velocity structures of the clouds to reveal the relation between the SS433 jet and the clouds. Finnaly, we assess the molecular clouds can be the origin of the TeV gamma-ray emission based on the physical parameters of the clouds. We will observe $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) and $^{13}$CO(J=1-0) lines.

Episodic mass accretion onto a high-mass (HM) YSO is predicted to achieve an extremely high accretion rate of >10^-3 MSun/yr within short time scale. Such accretion burst events are identified recently in NGC6334I and S255IR as outbursts of radio and infrared continuum emission. At the same time, they show sudden flare of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser, suggesting that the maser flare is useful to detect luminosity change of HM-YSO triggered by accretion burst. In Sep. 2019, the newly established Maser Monitoring Organization (M2O) reported a 6.7 GHz methanol maser flare in G24.33+0.14. This is the fourth example of possible accretion bursts in HM-YSOs after NGC6334I, S255IR, and G358.93-0.03, which is another new detection by M2O in Jan. 2019. G24.33+0.14 was observed in a pre-burst phase in ALMA Cycle 3. Thus, we can investigate millimeter methanol maser variability for the first time along with continuum emission. Our multi-transition multi-epoch data will reveal luminosity/temperature change and energy/mass ejection in the accretion burst. Since the maser flare will decay within one month (e.g. some methanol lines in G358.93-0.03), immediate ToO observations are required.',\n"," 'Proper Motions of Gas in the Immediate Vicinity of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole. In our Cycle 2 experiment, we discovered a very compact (<0.2\") high velocity (-450km/s) emission and absorption component in HCN(4-3), exactly centered on the Galactic Center SMBH SgrA*. This component is barely resolved at 0.2\" beam and shows significant variations during 4 separate epochs spanning 2 months. In particular, a narrow absorption feature is seen to shift in velocity by about 25 km/s during this period. The motion is consistent with a neutral dense cloud orbiting SgrA*, and could be associated with the G2 cloud infalling towards SgrA*. Because of its high velocity and faint intensity, this feature has never been seen before. In this cycle, we request 4 further epochs of observations to be separated on the order of 2 months again to trace the dynamics. We request higher resolution of 0.034\" to resolve the emission structure to test whether this is a gas streamer elongated in the direction of the detected velocity gradient. This study is making use of SgrA* to provide a very narrow pencil beam to study absorption and structural changes on very short time scales. We also make use of the high excitation submm lines in order to sample the neutral gas closest to SgrA*.',\n"," 'Why is ~ 1/4 of the LMCs molecular gas not forming massive stars?. We propose to map the LMCs quiescent molecular ridge, a GMC complex containing ~1/4 of all of the molecular gas in the galaxy, but which has very little associated massive star formation. The region is 30x below the extragalactic Schmitt-Kennicutt region, and even summing up all of the lower-mass and small embedded clusters still leaves the region inefficient compared to its molecular mass. It is important for any general theory of star formation to understand and explain such a large quiescent system. We propose here to first map the region with the ACA, revealing all few-parsec-scale molecular clumps and their properties. We will investigate whether the region is having difficulty forming forming stars because it cant form dense clumps, or because the clumps are present, but have extra support against collapse. We will determine whether the region is analogous to the dense \"bones\" of Milky Way molecular clouds. We will release our science-optimized large mosaic to the community, so that the most interesting parts can be followed up at higher resolution and frequency.',\n"," 'ALMA-JWST Joint Efforts on Calibrating Gas-Phase Metallicities of Star-Forming Galaxies in the Reionization Era. The gas-phase metallicities of high redshift galaxies are valuable probes of early galaxy assembly and chemical enrichment. However, traditional strong line methods rely on calibrations which have been shown to evolve with redshift due to the changing ionization properties of the interstellar medium. While some progress has been made on redshift-dependent calibrations at z~2 using temperature-sensitive auroral lines (e.g. [O III]4363), this approach is impractical beyond z~6. We propose to obtain direct-method metallicities for 3 galaxies at z_spec=6.0-7.2 by observing the [OIII]52um emission line. Our targets are already detected in [OIII]88um and have approved JWST observations targeting the key rest-optical lines, including [OIII]5007. The addition of [OIII]52um will provide electron temperatures, densities, and ~0.1 dex precision metallicities for the first time at such redshifts. ALMA measurements of [OIII]52um are the only feasible route for enabling a robust metallicity and chemical evolution analysis of these targets, which will serve as the crucial calibrating anchor for more extensive JWST and ALMA studies in the reionization era.',\n"," 'Heating Processes in Supernova-Shocked Clouds: Multi-J CO Line Survey toward the Magellanic Supernova Remnants. We propose multi-J CO line observations of shock-interacting clouds in Magellanic supernova remnants (SNRs) to better understand heating processes of shocked gas, which are important in revealing supernovae impacts on both star formation and galaxy evolution. Most recently, we analyzed shocked molecular clouds in the LMC SNR N49 using the archival ALMA CO(J = 1-0, 2-1) datasets. High kinetic temperatures of ~40 K are only seen in the shock front, which suggests the presence of shock heating. Models predict that kinetic temperature should be proportional to SNR age. Since N49 is a middle-aged SNR at 4800 yrs, this offers us an opportunity to survey a sample of both younger and older SNRs that have evidence of interactions with molecular clouds to test these predictions by measuring the kinetic temperatures of shock heated gas. We propose to observe a sample of LMC SNRs with ages from 860 to 10000 years to directly constrain the time-dependent evolution of shocked gas in SNRs for the first time.',\n"," 'Spectroscopic identification of a pilot sample of two hot dusty starbursts at z~4 hidden at 850um. Deep field imaging surveys at far-infrared (FIR) and millimeter bands have greatly enriched our knowledge of the distant universe by discovering a population of extremely dusty galaxies. There is a growing evidence of a rising dust temperature toward high redshifts, with galaxies at high redshifts (z>3-4) have hotter characteristic dust temperatures, compared to similar FIR luminous galaxies at z~2. New simulation results suggest that the hotter z>3 systems would be young galaxies at the early evolution phase with higher star-formation efficiency, the bulk of which still remains undetected in the typical surveys at 850um. We propose to spectroscopically confirm two 450um-bright but 850-faint dusty galaxies at z~4 that are drawn from our latest deep survey at 450um, likely representing the missing population of the hot galaxies. The observations will also allow to estimate effectively the molecular gas content to uncover the nature of hot dust emission and constrain the ISM properties through multiple CO lines. This observation will also serve as a benchmark for future follow-up observations with ALMA and JWST towards a more complete sample.',\n"," 'Tomography of a Galaxy Protocluster at z=5.3. Cosmological simulations suggest that massive galaxies at present day formed in the densest regions in the early universe, predicting the existence of massive protoclusters of intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift. We have recently identified such a unique region within 1.1 billion years of the Big Bang, hosting an extreme starburst and at least 13 normal star-forming (Ly-break) galaxies, within a narrow redshift interval (dz=0.002). This environment is a \"smoking gun\" for early massive galaxy formation through hierarchical buildup, giving key importance to understanding the physical properties of its member galaxies in detail. Building on our efforts in cycle-0, this proposal aims to add an essential missing piece to our comprehensive dataset on this region by mapping it out in [CII] and far-infrared continuum emission, and by imaging the cycle-0 targets down to 850 pc resolution. This will critically constrain the interstellar medium content, excitation, distribution and gas dynamics of the protocluster members, constituting their fuel for star formation, and dust-obscured star formation rates. This will be the first detailed ISM study of Ly-break galaxies at z>3.',\n"," 'Examining the Dust Dynamics Induced by Planet-disk Interaction. Migration of grown dust toward dust traps is crucial for facilitating the formation of pebbles and planetesimals. Specifically, the dust traps induced by planet-disk interaction have been well motivated and thus the theories are better understood. Thanks to the unprecedented sensitivity of ALMA, now we can base on diagnosing dust SED and polarized scattered light to yield tight constraints on the spatial distributions of maximum dust grain sizes and thereby constrain the theories. Surprisingly, these techniques have not been applicated to the PDS 70 disk, which is the only disk where the forming planets have been located by direct infrared imaging. It might be because it is not particularly bright and thus is disfavored in the early science phase of ALMA. Having sensed a strong desire to see such observations happen, we humbly pick up the task to plan this program. By requesting the 75 mas resolution, Band 7 full polarization and Band 3, 4 Stokes I observations, the immediate goals are (1) to verify the dust filtration induced by planet-disk interaction, and (2) to look for grown-dust vortices that are expected to be excited in the grown-dust ring.',\n"," 'Study of the first O-type bloated star candidate. Bloated stars are high-mass young stellar objects whose stellar surface is expanding due to active accretion on to them. While this phase of massive star formation is firmly predicted by models, no clear examples of O-type stars have been identified yet in such a phase. IRAS 19520+2759 is, to our knowledge, the best bloated star candidate with a luminosity > 10^5 Lsun, given its particular optical spectrum, lack of radio-continuum emission, its association with collimated outflow, and with an elongated, dense structure likely tracing a rotating structure perpendicular to the outflow. However, the association of the millimeter dense core and the optical star remains to be confirmed, and here we propose 0.15 arcsec angular resolution observations of the continuum at 1 mm (comparable to Hubble Space Telescope 0.1 arcsec resolution in the optical) in order to determine the position and morphology of the mm source. Simultaneous spectral line observations of dense gas tracers will allow to study the kinematics of the gas in the vicinities of the first O-type bloated star candidate.',\n"," 'Measurements of the magnetic field structure in the nearest protoplanetary disk. Magnetic fields are crucial for the evolution of planet-forming disks. However, observational constraints are still pending. TW Hya, the closest and brightest analog of the solar nebula, is a show-case example for studies of planet formation. TW Hya is also ideal for measurements of the magnetic field structure thanks to its almost perfect face-on orientation and very high degree of axial symmetry. Our aim is to obtain a resolved map of the magnetic field in TW Hya, and so uncover a key element in protoplanetary disk evolution, for the first time. Our previous (unpolarized) ALMA observation of CN(3-2) in TW Hya reveal that its (tau~1)-surface is located at the disks mid-plane. This makes CN(3-2) the ideal tracer for a direct measurement of the magnetic field in TW Hya. Further, we will constrain the source of the continuum polarization by multi-wavelength polarimetry in conjunction with the linearly polarized CN(3-2) line. This project will verify the magnetic field in the nearest protoplanetary disk, probe for grain growth, and uncover the polarizing mechanism behind continuum polarization, for the first time.',\n"," 'Characterising the putative dust trap in the pre-transitional disk of V1247 Ori. One of the major unsolved problems in the field of planet formation is the radial drift barrier, where dust grains acquire a very high inward drift velocity and drift into the star before they are able to grow into planets. One possible solution is dust trapping, where the dust particles get trapped in a pressure bump that might be triggered by planets or deadzones. Our ALMA Cycle3 40mas-resolution imaging of the pre-transitional disk of V1247 Ori revealed an inner ring and a sharply-confined crescent structure, constituting a prime-example for a dust trap. In the gap between the inner ring and crescent structure we detected in scattered light an intriguing sprial-arm structure that might be related to the accretion stream of the planet that is also triggering the dust trap. We propose ALMA follow-up observations at longer wavelengths (band 4) to reveal the expected dust grain composition differences between the crescent structure, the gap, and the inner disk. Detecting these opacity differences would provide the ultimate confirmation for the existence of dust traps and enable the detailed characterisation that is necessary to identify the triggering mechanism of the dust trap.',\n"," 'Time evolution of CO & H2O in the Martian atmosphere during a large-scale dust storm. We propose to use the ACA to monitor the evolution of CO and H2O in the Martian atmosphere, on a timescale of weeks and on a global size scale, during the current dust storm. The CO profile will be used to derive the global wind structure and vertical atmospheric temperature profile. The submm H2O line will be observed for the first time; its profile will give the vertical H2O abundance and the ACA spatial resolution will enable us to derive the H2O distribution over the planet. As well, we can can measure the H2O/HDO ratio, which is predicted to be affected by the exact origin of gaseous H2O. Dust storms are expected to affect the abundances of both of these molecules, as well as their vertical temperature profiles. We can test these predictions with the new observations, giving a better understanding of the Mars weather during and after such global events. The data can be compared with the latest Mars atmosphere models, as well as in-situ measurements by the orbiters and landers currently on the surface.',\n"," 'A sub-mm census of a very massive and old quiescent galaxy at z=3.19. We propose to use ALMA to target a unique newly confirmed z>3 massive quiescent galaxy. The galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 is revealed by JWST NIRSPEC to be at a spectroscopic redshift of 3.19. It has a stellar mass of 3E11 M_sun and a very red, unobscured, spectrum with a well developed 4000Å break, in contrast to the younger Balmer break seen in other z>3 massive quiescent galaxies. The JWST spectrum is extremely well fit by a stellar population of age 1.5 Gyr, i.e forming at very rapidly at z~11. ZF-UDS-7329 is 2-3x older than other massive quiescent galaxies at z>3 and quenched very rapidly in to a very compact red disk early in cosmic history. With ALMA we will probe for obscured star-formation (Band 7 dust continuum) and molecular gas (Band 3 CO(4-3)). Combining these measurements with the star-formation history reconstructed from the NIRSPEC spectra we can see if the physical mechanisms underpinning the formation of this remarkable object are different from the normal quiescent galaxies at z>3.',\n"," 'Origin of the Doubly-Flared Disk Structure around the Class 0 Protostar L1527. In our recent high-angular resolution (~0.2\") observation at 0.87 mm using ALMA, we have found a very interesting feature of the infant disk around the Class 0 solar-type protostar L1527. We have resolved the vertical structure of the edge-on disk, and have revealed its doubly flared structure. A radial dependence of the disk thickness is found to have an inflection point at 70 au. Possible origins of this structure are threefold: 1) Stractual and temperature changes in at the disk edge due to the materials accreting from the envelope. 2) A change in dust sizes due to coagulation (grain growth) in the dense and cold mid-plane. 3) A sudden increase of the dust opacity at 0.87 mm expected at the disk edge. In order to disentangle these possibilities, we here propose a very sensitive continuum observation at 3 mm band. With this program, we will be able to make a substantial step toward understandings of disk formation as well as dust evolution in an infant disk around the Class 0 protostar.',\n"," 'Establishing how quasars impact on the molecular gas in their host galaxies. The role of quasars in galaxy evolution remains controversial. Recent work has compared ~kpc-scale quasar-driven molecular outflows to the driving of ~10kpc molecular gas filaments by radio lobes from brightest cluster galaxies. This works suggests that the latter `radio feedback is the more effective at impacting upon molecular gas. However, we lack a systematic search for different feedback processes in the quasar samples. Indeed, recent radio + CO analyses of nine z<0.2 type 2 quasars, already highlights that `radio feedback on molecular gas can also be relevant in this population. However, this sample was pre-selected for known extreme gas kinematics. Therefore, we propose to observe the other eight targets from the parent sample to remove this bias. We will systematically search for molecular outflows and radio-gas interactions, measuring properties such as velocities, outflow rates and driving efficiencies. We will provide a quantitative assessment of the relative importance and efficiency of different AGN feedback mechanisms on the cold molecular gas on a homogeneous and representative sample of quasars.',\n"," 'Why is the galaxy NGC4945 extremely CN-luminous?. NGC4945 is the southern starburst galaxy that is nearby (D<5Mpc), provides strong molecular line emission, and also contains a Seyfert 2 nucleus. Its integrated intensity ratio between CN(1-0) and HCN(1-0) (~2) is one of the highest ever measured in a galaxy, yet the reason is still unknown. CN can be overproduced in both starburst and active galactic nucleus (AGN) environments, but the lack of previous spatially resolved CN and HCN observations in NGC4945 prevent us from linking the ratio to the coexistent nuclear activities. We propose to observe the two transitions of CN, HCN, HCO+, and CO in Bands 3 and 6 with a matching angular resolution of 1.0\" (~26 pc, at least 3 times better than any previous study in this galaxy). We plan to (a) resolve its central 2\" AGN component for the first time, and to study the intensity distribution of the species to understand where and why CN is so efficiently formed; and (b) study the kinematics of the nucleus, looking for signatures of inward and/or outward gas flows. ALMA is the only telescope able to provide the required angular resolution and sensitivity necessary to study the chemistry and physics in the central parsecs of this galaxy.',\n"," 'Determining the chemical origin of gas-phase methanol in the TW Hya protoplanetary disk. Detecting complex organic molecules (COMs) in protoplanetary disks is a \"holy grail\" for astrochemistry, because it links the complexity observed towards protostars with that in comets. The ALMA era has shone light on COMs in disks with the first detections of gas-phase methyl cyanide, CH3CN, in MWC 480, and methanol, CH3OH, in TW Hya. As a COM with an ice-chemistry origin, CH3OH is a powerful probe of the location and abundance of the disk ice reservoir, and of the non-thermal desorption mechanisms required to release it from the grain surfaces. We will observe four transitions of gas-phase methanol which span a range of upper level energies (17-40K), with a spatial resolution of 0.5\" (25AU) and a high sensitivity (< 2mJy/beam) to constrain its radial and vertical location in TW Hya. Parametric modelling to reproduce the spatially and spectrally resolved line emission will reveal its location and abundance, and chemical models will determine if theorised processes (e.g. photodesorption) are responsible for its chemical origin. These data are critical for robust determinations of the likelihood of using ALMA to detect COMs of even higher complexity in solar-analogue disks.',\n"," 'CO-Dark Molecular Gas in the Extended Ultraviolet Disk of M83 Revealed by Dust Continuum Observations. The extended ultraviolet (XUV) disks that are present in 10% of nearby galaxies offer the opportunity to study the interstellar medium and star formation in extreme conditions with low average gas density and surprisingly abundant star formation. However, our progress in understanding these XUV disks has been halted by the difficulty of detecting molecular gas via CO emission. In particular, no highly significant (>5sigma) CO was detected in an ALMA map of the XUV disk of M83 (a field with LMC-like metallicity) when we expected to detect 20-30 molecular clouds with >17sigma. We hypothesize that CO is weaker than expected because the molecular clouds are dominated by CO-dark molecular hydrogen, due to the strong local FUV radiation field or the small size of the star forming clumps (and not due to metallicity). We propose Band 7 dust continuum observations of part of the same field that was observed in CO. With these data, we will discover the first dust concentrations associated with CO-dark molecular clouds in XUV disks. We will test whether the number and mass of the molecular clouds agree with our predictions and we will derive the CO-to-H2 conversion factor for the region.',\n"," 'Detecting winds from RGB stars. Measurements of mass-loss rates from red and early-asymptotic giant branch (RGB/early-AGB) stars are an order of magnitude too low to explain the difference in mass between RGB stars and their dusty AGB progeny. Part of the problem is a lack of calibration of chromospheric mass-loss rate indicators. We proposal a pilot study to make the first conclusive measurements of molecular mass lost from 12 bright RGB/early-AGB stars, plus alpha Her, a more-massive star which is also transitioning from a chromospheric to a dusty wind. These will test the validity of the mass-loss rates and wind velocities of chromospheric indicators. We will also measure the radio photospheric flux of these stars, giving insight into their chromospheric heating. We will also resolve the envelopes of at least some stars, giving our first indication of whether these winds are smooth, clumpy, or complex in morphology.',\n"," 'ALMA-LEGUS: The Impact of Spiral Arm Structure on Molecular Cloud Properties and Star Cluster Formation. The impact of spiral structure and feedback from stellar populations on molecular clouds has broad-ranging implications for star formation in the present day universe. We propose to map the CO(2-1) emission on ~14-19 pc scales of two well-chosen disk galaxies, NGC1313 and NGC7793, which have similar masses, star formation rates and morphologies, but have very different spiral structures and widely different stellar cluster properties. These galaxies were observed as part of the HST Treasury program LEGUS (Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey), and we have derived the star formation histories, and cluster ages and masses. The unprecedented ALMA/LEGUS synergy will provide a comprehensive investigation of star formation in spiral galaxies by connecting the resolved molecular properties with detailed stellar population information. Specific issues to be addressed include: the timescales over which star formation occurs in molecular clouds, the lifetimes of clouds, and the role of star formation in the gas turbulence. We will compare our results with our predictions from simulations, to guide next-generation models of star formation and galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Jupiter Family Comet Composition: Unique insights into Disk Midplane Chemistry. We propose to measure the molecular abundances of nitriles (HCN, HNC, HC3N, CH3CN), oxygen-bearing organics (H2CO, CH3OH), and sulfur compounds (SO2, SO, CS) in the Jupiter-family comet (JFC) 21P/GZ. The 2018 apparition of 21P is extremely favorable, offering a rare opportunity to study a JFC in unprecedented detail -- this dynamical class of comets is significantly under-studied in all parent volatiles [15,16]. Furthermore, our target molecules are some of the most under-represented species in compositional studies of all comets (JFCs and Oort cloud comets), such as SO2, HC3N, and CH3CN. In synergy with contemporaneous infrared observations, the proposed ALMA/ACA data will greatly improve our knowledge of JFC chemical compositions. Cometary mixing ratios provide a unique probe of disk mid-plane chemistry, and, through quantitative comparison with protoplanetary disk models, our observations are expected to help advance our knowledge on the formation and composition of the materials that served as the building blocks of our Solar System.',\n"," 'Characterizing the physics and chemistry related to accretion shocks in protostars. In the low-mass star formation process, infalling material from the envelope meets the Keplerian disk and accretion shocks are produced. This is followed by an increase of the dust temperature and sublimation of molecular species into the gas-phase that, otherwise, will remain locked on dust grains. Although accretion shocks are predicted by theoretical models, only few protostars show evidence of these shocks at the disk-envelope interface and it is still not well understood if the observed shock-related species are being formed entirely on dust surfaces and then sublimated, or if they are formed in the gas-phase. We propose to observe a young protostar, IRS 44, at 0.1\" that has been associated with accretion shocks from SO2 observations. We will observe multiple transitions of SO, CS, OCS, H2S, and H2CO, and assess their excitation conditions. The comparison between these molecules will clarify if SO2 is formed in the gas-phase or if it is directly desorbed from dust grains, or a combination of both. This proyect will provide clues about the chemical complexity that accretion shocks could generate and their implications on the material available for planet formation.',\n"," 'eta Crucis campaign. Herschel observations of naked-eye star eta Crucis (HD 105211), in the Southern Cross, revealed a resolved debris disk likely generated by a ring of planetesimals at 155 AU. At a mere 19.8 pc away, eta Cru is one of the closest and brightest (V=4.1) debris-disk host stars. The debris ring is also extremely bright--0.5 Jy at 100 microns--and extended, with a major axis of >14 arcseconds. Here we request a 242 GHz (1.2 mm) map of eta Cru. Our goals are (a) to resolve the inner hole of the disk, (b) to use the integrated 242 GHz flux density to compute the mass and surface density in mm-sized grains, which may be raw ingredients for ongoing planet formation on 1-2 Gyr timescales, and (c) to use the radial extent of the disk to place limits on the mass of a possible planet orbiting near the inner edge.',\n"," 'Resolved Kinematics of a Normal, Star-forming Galaxy at z=5. What are the kinematic properties of normal, star-forming galaxies at z~5? In the high-z universe between z~1-3 IFU surveys have obtained resolved kinematics of hundreds of main-sequence galaxies. At z>4, however, our knowledge of the dynamical properties of typical, star-forming galaxies is scarce. To remedy this situation we propose to obtain spatially resolved kinematics of a normal, star-forming galaxy at z=5.5 based on Band 7 observations of the [CII] 158 um line. The latter represents an exciting new probe of the kinematics of high-z galaxies: it is one of the brightest emission line in galaxies (and remains bright in low metallicity environments), and its emission commonly extends beyond the point where star formation has ceased. Our target galaxy has been carefully selected to represent the properties of typical star-forming galaxies at z~5, and also due to its wealth of ancillary data including a [CII] ALMA detection. Our project will provide first of their kind measurements for typical star-forming galaxies at z~5, including rotation curves, diagnostics of disk stability, and constraints on the structure and baryonic mass fraction of the disk.',\n"," 'HD as a powerful tool to trace gas flows in primordial galaxies. Gas flows are recognised to be fundamental processes driving galaxy evolution. Observationally gas outflows and inflows in galaxies are very difficult to probe, and in particular their molecular phase. This is even more difficult in primordial galaxies, since steep metallicity evolution makes traditional molecular tracers even more unreliable. The (1-0) transition of deuteriated molecular hydrogen, especially if seen in absorption, is potentially a perfect tracer of the column of molecular hydrogen, completely independent of metallicity and of gas excitation. Through a Cycle 2 programme we have recently obtained the first detection of HD(1-0) in absorption in a lensed galaxy at z=5.6. This is a truly revolutionary discovery. In this system HD is tracing both outflowing and inflowing gas, with unprecedented accuracy. We hereby propose to followup on this discovery to map HD absorption with higher sensitivity and higher angular resolution throughout the entire lensed galaxy, hence providing the most detailed picture of the outflowing and inflowing gas in a primordial galaxy. We also propose to target two additional water transitions to constrain the physics of the outflowing gas.',\n"," 'Nuclear spin ratios as clues to the origin of deuterated ammonia. Ammonia and its deuterated variants are among the very few tracers of the physical and chemical conditions inside prestellar cores where stars and planets form. To fully exploit observations of these species, one should understand their formation. With this aim we wish to determine the spatial distributions of the ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in the starless core Ophiuchus/H-MM1. NH2D and NHD2 are supposed to form primarily in the gas phase, in reactions which should lead to clear deviations from the statistical ortho/para ratios (3:1 and 2:1). Previous (single-dish) observations are, however, consistent with statistical spin ratios, which are characteristic of grain-surface production. Because of a lack of spatial information, one cannot exclude the possibility that the ratios deviate from statistical values in core centres where gas-phase reactions most likely dominate. The proposed mapping with ALMA+ACA aims at resolving this issue. Different spin ratios in the inner and outer parts of the cloud would imply different formation mechanisms in these regions, whereas similar spin ratios everywhere would indicate that the current gas-phase reaction scheme needs to be revised.',\n"," 'Pinpointing dust-enshrouded star-forming regions within young proto-cluster galaxies at z=2.16. We propose ALMA Band-7 (870um) observations of H-alpha-selected, massive star-forming galaxies (with ULIRG-class IR luminosity) selected in a rich proto-cluster environment at z=2.16 (PKS1138-262). By spatially resolving their dust continuum emission on ~1-kpc scale, we will identify dust-enshrouded star-forming clumps inside the galaxies, and pinpoint the location of most intense dusty starbursts (hence rapid stellar build-up) within the young cluster galaxies. By comparing the nature/luminosities of SF clumps within proto-cluster galaxies with those of general field galaxies at the same redshift (which will be obtained through our successful ALMA Cycle-1+2 programme), we will determine if the SF clumps within the cluster galaxies tend to have boosted activity (due to their accelerated bulge growth), or if the massive star-forming galaxies reported in the proto-cluster environment are simple ``scaled-up versions of general field galaxies.',\n"," '30 Doradus: Dense Gas in the Nearest Super-Star Cluster v0.13.1. 30 Doradus is the nearest super-star cluster, and an ideal laboratory in which to study the effects of vigorous star formation on molecular gas in galaxies. We propose to image the northern molecular cloud in 30 Doradus, showcasing the unprecedented power of ALMA, even in early science, to understand detailed physical conditions in extragalactic multiphase interstellar media. We will image the entire cloud in the most commonly used extragalactic dense gas tracers including HCN 1-0, HCO+ 1-0, and CS 2-1 (and isotopologues), measure the density, mass and gravitational support of dense starless and starforming cores. We will image most of the cloud in 12 and 13CO 2-1 and other tracers of the warm interclump medium of this starburst photodissociation region (PDR), resolving the PDR structure. In combination with our Spitzer and Herschel data, and radio recombination line images obtained simultaneously with the molecular emission, we will model the physical conditions and amount of \"dark molecular hydrogen\" in a real starburst PDR at reduced metallicity for the first time. Finally, we will image a small region in high-excitation lines including CO 6-5 that are particularly sensitive to conditions in the hot dense clumps of PDRs. Detailed analysis of the molecular environment of the nearest reduced-metallicity starburst will inform the interpretation of many ALMA observations, revealing the true nature of the gas emitting brightly in these lines in more distant galaxies',\n"," 'Characterizing the Morphology, Kinematics, and Excitation in the Nuclear Region of Arp 220. Our ALMA observations of CO J=6-5, 3-2 and 13CO 4-3 in a late-stage galaxy merger, Arp 220, provide key insights into an important phase of galaxy evolution. Deep CO absorption (going below the continuum baseline) is detected at the centers of the merging nuclei. Evidence for a molecular outflow and a signature of an infall is found associated with the nuclear region, which also shows extreme column density and large dust optical depths. Multiple CO transitions are needed to characterize the deep absorption features seen in the two nuclei, to estimate the mass and model the excitation of the infall surrounding the nuclear disks, and to measure the spatial variation in excitation and kinematics by comparing the cold (low-J) and warm (high-J) gas maps. 12CO 4-3, 8-7, and 13CO 6-5 were part of our accepted Cy3 program but could not be observed and thus we are re-proposing them in Cy5. 13CO 6-5 will supplement 13CO 4-3 to unambiguously discriminate between absorption and outflow models and place limits on the 12C/13C isotopic ratio. Arp 220 is bright and has highly excited molecular gas and therefore makes an excellent target for utilization of ALMA at high frequencies.',\n"," 'Spatially resolving the circumstellar envelope of WISE J180956.27-330500.2, an object recently experienced an extreme mass ejection. This proposal aims to resolve the circumstellar envelope of WISE J180956.27-330500.2, an object with an extremely optically thick circumstellar envelope using the long-baseline mode. Since its discovery in 2012 as an object showing significant change of the infrared fluxes in the last 20 years, we have carried out an intensive follow-up observation in various wavelengths to reveal its nature. Our ALMA Cycle 1 observation have detected CO(3-2) and SiO(8-7) lines on top of the relatively strong continuum. The expansion velocity of the molecules is 70 km/s. These observation data do not correspond to any kinds of known objects, and the nature of WISE J1810 has not been identified. To estimate the distance to the object and the luminosity of the object, we propose a high-spatial resolution observation of WISE J1810. The expected size of the object is 40-70 mas, and the ALMAs long-baseline observation shall resolve it. The observation will be carried out primarily in CO(2-1) line and continuum in Band 6.',\n"," 'How do supermassive black holes grow? Tracing gas transport in the luminous AGN NGC4593 down to the central 5pc.. We propose to map the circum-nuclear molecular gas distribution, using CO(2-1), in the nearest massive high-accretion rate AGN, NGC4593, at 5 pc spatial resolution. We will test simulation-predictions on a potentially essential gas transport mechanism to fuel supermassive black holes (BHs) in galaxy centers. Gas transport is caused by torques resulting from a (1) high central molecular surface mass density, (2) a lopsided gas distribution, and (3) signature overdense structures as e.g. single armed spirals, from several 100 pc all the way into the sphere of influence of the BHs, and to the accretion disk. NGC4593 is the nearest AGN with a M(BH)~10^7 Msun and accretion rate of several % of Eddington and thus representative of the AGN population responsible for >50% of the BH mass density growth since z=1, and likely beyond. Multiwavelength data exist for this AGN, includin HST and coarse CO from ALMA showing a central single armed dust and gas spiral. ALMAs high spatial resolution now permits, for the first time, a trace of the molecular gas all the way to the BHs sphere of influence (~10 pc), to test this essential but empirically untested secular mechanism for BH growth.',\n"," 'A Top-down View of Massive Cluster Formation in a Nearby Nuclear Starburst Ring. We aim to understand the formation and evolution of young massive clusters (YMCs) with high-resolution observations of a relatively face-on nuclear starburst ring in the nearby galaxy M95 (NGC 3351). We will use ALMA to observe extinction-free tracers of dust, dense molecular gas, and recent star formation at 0.12\" = 6 pc scales, which is adequate to discern and conclusively identify YMC progenitors. These observations represent the last missing element in the multiwavelength inventory (including VLA, VLT/MUSE, HST, and JWST) and will enable us to: (1) identify forming YMCs at the earliest, heavily embedded stage, (2) characterize the ongoing star formation and stellar feedback processes inside YMCs, and (3) put YMC formation in the context of their natal galactic environment. This will be just the fourth embedded YMC population study conducted with ALMA, and more crucially, the first in a nearly face-on system. The top-down viewing angle will allow us to establish a quantitative link between YMCs and their surrounding ISM and dynamical environment through multiwavelength synergies, thereby providing unique observational tests for massive cluster formation theories and simulations.',\n"," 'A Critical Comparison of Different Methods to Measure SMBH Masses. With the unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of ALMA, the newly-proposed molecular gas kinematics method holds great potential to accurately measure supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses in galaxies of all types. However, degeneracies between modelling parameters limits the current measurement uncertainties, and different measuring techniques have rarely been cross-calibrated. Here, we thus propose to cross-check the molecular gas method with that of megamaser disks, that currently provides the most accurate extragalactic SMBH masses. CO (2-1) emission will therefore be observed to verify the existence of molecular gas in the nucleus of maser galaxies. If strong emission is detected, higher resolution ALMA observations will complete the SMBH mass measurement in the future, enabling the first independent check of the method. Data from this proposal also enable to study the process of angular momentum transfer across different spatial scales (from the molecular gas disk to the accretion disk), and thus of SMBH feeding mechanisms, both highly contentious issues.',\n"," 'Searching for the first extragalactic hot molecular cores. We propose to search for the first extragalactic hot molecular cores toward three prominent high-mass star-forming cores in the N159 star-forming region in the LMC. Hot cores constitute a very important stage of the stellar development, when the star already emits copious IR radiation, thereby heating up its environment, but before he destroys its molecular cradle by ionizing it with UV photons. Pragmatically, hot cores, by virtue of their high temperatures and densities, are also strong emitters of many molecular lines, which makes them relatively easily observable. No extragalactic hot core has been found so far, and detecting them in the LMC will be particularly rewarding, as it allows to probe how high-mass stars form in low-metallicity galaxies, which are representative of the environment at the peak of star formation in the universe. It is known that the chemistry of the ISM in metal poor galaxies is different, but does this extend to the densest, most shielded regions? How does this affect the formation of organic molecules, which may play a role in the emergence of life?',\n"," 'Debris Disks Around Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. At 3.65 and 3.22 pc, respectively, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani are the two closest Solar analogues to host detectable debris disks. In addition, both stars are reported to host planets within a few AU detected by radial velocity variations. The presence of additional planets, and their role in the dynamical evolution of these nearby systems, could be revealed by their influence on the surrounding debris disks. We propose ALMA ACA-only observations to resolve the millimeter continuum emission from the Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani debris disks. By combining these data with dynamical simulations, we will (1) robustly measure the locations of the disk inner and outer edges and their position relative to the radial velocity planetary systems, (2) quantify the disk surface density gradient and assess whether these systems are stirred by the influence of an additional massive planet within the disk or self-stirred and collisionally depleted from the inside-out, and (3) use disk features such as offsets and azimuthal asymmetries to place constraints on otherwise inaccessible wide-separation planets.',\n"," 'Bright beacons? First survey of the [OI] 63-um emission in z>6 dusty starbursts. We propose a pilot study of the [OI] 63-um emission in a sample of z>6 dusty, star-forming galaxies. Predicted to outshine the [CII] line, the [OI]63 line is a potentially powerful tracer of molecular gas at the highest redshifts. With a total of 6 hours of ALMA Band 9 time, we will for the first time robustly detect the [OI]63 emission in three z~6 starburst galaxies, increasing the number of [OI]63 detections in z>1 SMGs by more than 50%. As ALMA Band 9/10 provide a unique window for studying the [OI]63 emission in high-redshift (dusty) starbursts, this study will open a new window for studying molecular ISM at the highest redshift,and provide key information for the planned FIR space observatories SPICA and the Origins space telescope.',\n"," 'Constraining Jet Formation and Evolution with X-ray Binaries. Relativistic jets are launched from accreting black holes (BHs) on all scales, from stellar-mass BHs in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) to supermassive BHs in active galactic nuclei (AGN). These jets deposit significant amounts of energy into the surrounding medium, which affects star formation, galaxy evolution, and even the distribution of matter in the universe. Therefore, it is essential that we understand the physics of these accretion-fed outflows. Of the many objects that launch jets, BHXBs are ideal testbeds, as they evolve on timescales of days to months (unlike AGN that evolve over millions of years). Broad-band spectral measurements of BHXB jet emission constrain the physical conditions in the jet, which can then be coupled to the properties of the accretion flow, probing the mechanism that governs how jets are launched and quenched. The mm regime bridges a crucial gap between radio and IR frequencies in the broad-band jet spectrum. Here we target the next outbursting BHXB with ALMA, to probe the evolving mm flux. Coupled with our exceptional multi-wavelength coverage, we will constrain the dynamic broad-band spectral energy distribution in BHXBs with unparalleled accuracy.',\n"," 'Submillimeter nature of a putative molecular torus in the type-1 low-luminosity AGN of NGC 1097. The detailed nature of a dusty molecular torus, which is the heart of the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), is still a matter of debate, despite the more than decades-long modeling effort. Here, we propose to observe the CO(3-2) line emission towards the central region of a nearby type-1 low-luminosity AGN, NGC 1097, at 80 mas (5.6 pc) resolution. The 860 micron continuum and HCO+(4-3) line emission will also be detected. With this unprecedented high resolution and sensitivity, we will resolve the innermost r < 20 pc region, where previous observations suggest the presence of a geometrically thick molecular disk. The sphere of influence of this AGN (~ 12 pc) will also be resolved. With these data, we will study the spatial distribution of gas and dust around the AGN and infer the gas kinematics of the region to constrain molecular disk models, as well as to directly estimate the black hole mass.',\n"," 'Revealing the mechanism of massive star formation in NGC6822. It is known that star complexes are often formed in massive giant molecular clouds (GMCs). In the other study we found that the massive star formation in W51, one of the most luminous star forming regions in the Galaxy, was triggered by cloud-cloud collision (CCC). In this proposal, we focus on Hubble V, which shows the most active star-formation in a nearby galaxy NGC6822. The star formation properties are similar between the two, although general properties of their parent galaxies are quite different. It is intriguing to resolve the GMC associated with Hubble V at a high spatial resolution of sub-pc, and investigate if the star formation was also triggered by CCC same as W51 or not. We propose to observe 12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1), C18O(2-1), and H30alpha emission lines at a spatial resolution comparable with that in our study of W51, ~0.4 pc. We will apply our understandings and method used in the W51 GMC to reveal the internal structures of the GMC, and search the observational signature of CCC. The new ALMA data will allow us to make direct comparisons between W51 in the Galaxy and Hubble V in NGC6822, leading to a comprehensive understanding of massive star formation in GMCs.',\n"," 'Closing the Loop of AGN Feedback: Cold Accretion in NGC 1275 within the Sphere of Gravitational Influence. ALMA recently has started to provide evidences of cold molecular gas which could have formed from warmer gas via radiative cooling in Bright Clueter Galaxy (BCG) systems. Such a cold gas is a candidate for the cold accretion which connects the feedback loop between the SMBH and host galaxy / ICM. NGC 1275, the nearby BCG in the Perseus cluster, is the ideal target to study the role of the cold accretion for the AGN activity. In Cycle 5, we detected the HCN(3-2) and HCO+(3-2) emissions within ~50 pc in NGC 1275, which showed a disk-like structure. This indicates that NGC 1275 possesses a significant amount of cold dense gas at its center, which is a possible connection with the cold accretion. Here we propose to observe the HCN(3-2)/HCO+(3-2) lines in NGC 1275 to study their properties within the Bondi radius, which will provide an unambiguous evidence that the cold gas is accreting to the SMBH. Thanks to its proximity, the observations with configuration-10 can resolve the Bondi radius of NGC 1275 (8.6 pc). The outcome will be a strong indication that the cold accretion is the dominant mechanism of mass fueling in BCG systems and eventually characterize the AGN activity.',\n"," 'An Astrometric Search for Planets Orbiting in the Alpha Centauri System. We propose a pilot study consisting of a series of high signal-to-noise (SNR) observations of the nearby stellar binary alpha Cen A and B to make precise measurements of their relative orbit. In addition to probing the limits of ALMAs differential astrometric precision, these measurements will improve our knowledge of the orbit of the alpha Cen AB system by factors of two to five in just a few years and will form the start of a search for exoplanets in this system.',\n"," 'Systematically Measuring CO Emission of Double-Barred Galaxies. We propose to initiate a systematic and reliable study on molecular gas in double-barred galaxies. The inner bar in double-barred galaxies is one of the mechanisms to drive gas inflow to fuel active galactic nuclei. However, it is still unclear whether and how much gas is needed to maintain a long-lived inner bar. Previous studies were unable to provide reliable results due to the difficulty to identify true double-barred galaxies and inadequate sensitivity and spatial resolution to measure the gas mass in the entire galaxy as well as in the inner bar region. To remedy this situation, we propose to obtain the CO line emission of seven double-barred galaxies which have been confirmed to have a unique feature called sigma-hollows. This feature identifies them as true double-barred galaxies. Using these ALMA observations, we will be able to provide reliable constraints of the gas mass on theories to shed light on the formation of double-barred galaxies. Our data will also provide important information for future studies to investigate the gas properties in double-barred galaxies, such as the gas inflow rate and the gas viscosity, which require higher spatial and velocity resolution.',\n"," 'What is the Heating Source of the Dusty Streamers in the High Redshift Obscured Quasar W2246-0526?. At z = 4.6, W2246-0256 (W2246) is the most luminous obscured quasar known, and it is experiencing a multiple-merger event. Recent ALMA 212um rest-frame continuum observations have revealed not only that W2246 is surrounded by at least 3 companion galaxies, but also that these are connected to the central source by dusty structures resembling tidal streamers, extending over at least 35 kpc in length. This is the first time that direct morphological evidence is presented for a galaxy merger at such high redshift. The energy source responsible for the dust heating in these streamers is, however, unknown. Here we propose to obtain deep ALMA band 4 observations of the CO(7-6) emission line in the W2246 streamers, with which we will distinguish between the two main possible heating mechanisms: in-situ star formation or direct illumination from the central AGN. These observations will showcase the extreme environments that the most luminous galaxies may be experiencing in the early universe, informing theoretical models of galaxy evolution --that will have to reproduce the physical conditions observed in this exceptional merger system, as they occur in nature.',\n"," 'Ionized Gas, Radiation Field, Masses, and Dust Temperature in Forming Massive Clusters in the NGC253 Starburst. Our ALMA observations in B7 at 0.1\" resolution identified massive star clusters in the process of formation in the core of the NGC 253 starburst (Leroy et al. 2018). The characterization of these clusters is needed to understand the high-efficiency \"starburst mode\" of star formation, the life cycle of massive clusters, and the effects of massive-star feedback on star forming clouds. This proposal aims to: 1) directly measure the ionizing photon flux and synchrotron emission in these objects, which impact the stellar masses and ages of the clusters, and 2) constrain the dust optical depth and dramatically improve estimates for the temperature and gas mass of these sources. Our observations also yield a direct constraint on the hardness of the ionizing radiation field, and through it on the high mass end of the stellar IMF in these young clusters. In combination with ALMA data in hand, we will also study the excitation of the molecular gas in the starburst at 2 pc resolution, and the impact of massive stellar nucleosynthesis in the cluster-forming gas. These data are key to build a picture of the dominant star formation mechanism in starbursting systems at low and high redshift.',\n"," 'Resolved Multi-J CO/[CI] study of a strongly lensed, Planck-selected z = 2.66 dusty protocluster of at least 9 DSFGs. We propose, for the first time in a gas-rich z>1 overdensity, a multi-line modeling of the [CI] / CO line and dust spectral energy distributions (SED). PJ0846 is an all-sky Planck selected protocluster consisting of 9 strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) within 100 kpc at z=2.66. This analysis aims to determine the mechanisms driving SF in dense environments and search for evidence of quenching prior to halo mass assembly. Piecemeal archival data with limited sensitivity has sparked dedicated follow-up (0.1-0.2\") observations of [CI], CO (3-2, 7-6) emission lines and ACA B9 continuum measurements to constrain the rise/fall of the CO ladder and the peak of the dust SED. What sets this project apart is: (1) PJ0846 is a lensed protocluster field with 9 DSFGs allowing high S/N multi-line and continuum studies, while removing an important systematic uncertainty in gas mass via modeling, and (2) an existing lens model will use the data to probe spatially resolved gas excitation conditions at 10 to 100 pc scales to examine intrinsic gas properties associated with this overdense burst of DSFGs within a protocluster environment at Cosmic Noon -- all within a single field.',\n"," 'Unveiling the AGN impact on the ISM in local Seyfert2 galaxies by tracing the dense gas at sub-kpc scale. We propose ALMA B5 observations to measure two key tracers of dense molecular gas, HCN and HCO+ (J=2-1), for two local (z<0.2) LIRGs, optically classified as Sey 2. Previous studies assessed the effect of AGN activity with respect to the star formation (SF) onto the molecular gas via CO-SLED studies on galactic scales. To make a significant step forward in our understanding of the AGN effect on ISM, we need to spatially resolve the nuclear regions at the scale of GMCs (~40pc), to assess the XDRs vs PDRs relative contributions. This study will take advantage of the characterisation of the sources in terms of AGN intrinsic power and obscuration level from our X-ray analysis. These provide the key inputs to photoionisation models, and will allow us to interpret the ALMA data on a solid physical ground, in terms of relative importance of AGN and SF. The comparison of spatially resolved HCN/HCO+ between different molecular line transitions will reveal the nature of the radiation field impinging on the GMCs surface. The required high-spatial resolution also enable us to probe the internal dynamics and structure of these highly obscured systems, since HCN-VIB emission is optically thin.',\n"," 'Constraining the mass of the fastest molecular outflow in the local universe. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and/or nuclear starbursts in the form of molecular outflows is frequently invoked in galaxy evolution to explain the observed black-hole - bulge property correlations, but despite many observations of massive molecular outflows, their energetics are still poorly constrained. The unknown chemistry and column density of the outflowing molecular gas dominate the uncertainty in the outflow mass (via the CO luminosity to H2 conversion factor), and thus the energetics and origin of the outflow. We propose simultaneous high-resolution (0.2) observations of 12CO(3-2) and its optically thin isotopologues in IRAS 20100-4156, an IR-luminous galaxy hosting the most energetic molecular outflow nearby, as a way to obtain the outflow column density, trace the entirety of the outflowing gas, and thus obtain its true mass and energetics. Such observations are crucial to test theoretical models for how outflow energy/momenta couple to the AGN/starburst luminosity. Our proposed observations also offer the opportunity to study the nucleosynthesis history and test the role of the nuclear starburst in launching the observed outflow.',\n"," 'The Core Mass Function and its Evolution in an Extreme Protocluster. The Core Mass Function is a theoretically important and observationally accessible component in the star formation process. It has not been characterized on the high mass (M>10 Msun) end due to sampling incompleteness despite the importance of high mass star formation for galactic evolution. We propose an observing program in the high-mass protocluster W49N -- the most luminous in the Galactic disk -- to observe a single-time snapshot of the CMF using 2400 AU resolution continuum observations. We will use gas temperature measurements with CH3CN and H2CO to more accurately determine the core masses and to measure the effects of stellar feedback on the CMF. We will constrain the evolution of this observed CMF by measuring the gas flows from parsec to core scales. This project will provide a powerful and detailed test of theoretical models of the CMF.',\n"," 'Measuring Magnetic Field Morphologies in Disks Using the GK Effect. Polarimetric observations and theoretical modeling indicate that we cannot measure the magnetic field morphology in circumstellar disks via (sub)millimeter polarization continuum observations. The Zeeman Effect is also very difficult to observe toward circumstellar disks, and does not provide the plane of sky field morphology. One other promising way to measure the magnetic field morphology in the plane of the sky is via line polarization. The Goldreich-Kylafis (GK) effect suggests that line polarization is perpendicular or parallel to magnetic field direction. We propose to observe line polarization toward the disks IM Lup and HD 142527. These observations will tell us whether the GK effect can measure the magnetic field morphology in disks.',\n"," 'The molecular gas of a multi-phase filament in the lobes of Fornax A. We propose to use the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) to study the distribution of molecular gas in a multi-phase gas filament at the outskirts of the nearby radio galaxy Fornax A. The 25 kpc long filament is located along a bridge of radio emission connecting the two giant radio lobes and at the edge of an X-ray cavity. The filament has been detected in Halpha as well as HI (3 x 10^7 Msun) and dust. Its properties are alike those of filaments of cooling gas detected around more distant and massive radio galaxies. The only exception is that those filaments are rich of molecular gas, too, while so far our target only has an upper limit. Here, we propose to observe the filament in 12CO(2-1) along its full extent (~4 arcmin), and resolve any molecular gas down to a molecular gas surface density of 1.0 Msun pc^-2. We expect molecular gas to be present as we already detect cool atomic gas and dust, although it is unclear how much of it might be present, and what its exact distribution and kinematics might be. Observing the molecular gas will enable us to quantify how gas is cooling within the filament and determine if star formation is on-going or may occur in this region.',\n"," 'The evolution of the molecular gas content at z>3. Revealing the origin of the enhanced cosmic star formation rate density at high redshifts is fundamental for understanding galaxy evolution, because it is responsible for producing the bulk of stars observed locally. Recent observations and theoretical studies have suggested that the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate is not regulated by variations of the star-formation efficiency (due to merger/interaction processes), but by the evolution of the content of molecular gas in galaxies. This can be examined observationally, and actually galaxies at z~2 show much higher gas fraction than local galaxies, in agreement with theoretical expectations. At z>3 the situation remains uncertain. The few CO measurements of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and extremely bright Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) at z~3 available today indicate lower gas fractions (20-50%) than predicted. However, those galaxies with SFRs up to ~1000 Msun/yr are not representative of the bulk of star-forming galaxies at z~3. Moreover, their metallicities remain poorly constrained, hence the CO-to-H2 conversion is highly uncertain. Here we propose to measure the gas fractions of four `normal galaxies at z~3.0-3.5 through ALMA band 3 observations of CO emission. We focus on four LBGs investigated in the AMAZE project (an ESO Large Program; Maiolino, Nagao, et al. 2008), which is based on near-infrared integral field observations with VLT/SINFONI. The selected galaxies are optimal targets for achieving our scientific goal because they are representative of the usual, UV-selected LBG population, contributing to the bulk of the star formation activity at those redshifts. Also, these galaxies are very well studied, and their properties such as metallicity (which allows for direct inference of the critical CO/H2 conversion factor), stellar mass, morphology, and dynamics are well determined from a large collection of data, including SINFONI spatially-resolved near-IR spectroscopy, HST optical and near-IR imaging, and Spitzer mid-IR photometry. The obtained gas content information of the targets will enable us, for the first time, to identify the dominant mode of star formation at z>3.',\n"," 'A Comprehensive View of Magnetic Fields around Young Protostars NGC1333 IRAS 4A1 and 4A2 (III). This is a continuation of our Cycle 2~6 project on the magnetic field measurements toward IRAS4A, where only one of the two science goals (Band 7, 0.2\") was observed. Here we propose to finish the other science goal (Band 7, 1\") and also add a science goal for extremely high resolution observtion (Band 7, 0.03\"). Measuring polarized emission from aligned dust grains remains the most efficient method to probe the structure of the magnetic fields in star-forming regions. Although recent theoretical and simulation work by Kataoka et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2016a,b) demonstrated that polarization originating from scattering cannot be ignored in the protostellar disks, our multi-wavelength observations show that at Band 7 the polarization is mainly from dust emission/absorption for optically thin/thick cases, respectively. With the current data, we show that it is very feasible to explore the magnetic fields at 10 AU scales (0.03\"). If the two science goals requested here are carried out, we will have the most complete picture of magnetic fields at the widest physical ranges that could be observed with ALMA.',\n"," 'exoALMA. Detecting planets embedded in their natal protoplanetary disk is essential if we are to understand the phenomenal diversity found in the properties of mature exoplanets. Recent results have shown that ALMA is uniquely capable of detecting a population of these embedded planets by revealing strong, localized deviations in the gas velocity structure driven by the embedded planet. Here, we propose a groundbreaking Large Program to undertake the first sub-mm planet hunting campaign. We request 100 mas resolution observations of 12CO (3-2), 13CO (3-2) and CS (7-6) line emission at a ~26m/s velocity resolution for 15 sources identified as those most amenable for the detection of planets. 3D hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions have shown planets excite an extensive family of kinematic features (spiral arms, meridional flows and circumplanetary rotation), enabling strong constraints on the planets mass and on its immediate environment. These observations will provide the most comprehensive study of the physical and dynamical structure of protoplanetary disks to date, providing a rich legacy dataset for the study of the planet formation process.',\n"," 'Unveiling the nature of peculiar embedded icy objects discovered by AKARI. We propose high-sensitivity molecular line observations in Band 6 and 7 to unveil the nature of two peculiar icy objects, which were recently discovered by infrared spectroscopic survey of the Galactic plane with the AKARI satellite. Both objects show deep ice absorption features that are often seen in YSOs or background stars sitting behind dense clouds, but they are located neither in known star-forming regions nor in known dense clouds, and their infrared SEDs are incompatible with existing YSO models. If they are truly YSOs, similar objects should have eluded past photometric surveys, which would require a revision of our view of the distribution of YSOs in a Galactic scale. If they are background stars, there must be dense and very compact clouds in the line-of-sight, which have eluded past dense cloud surveys, or ice species may grow in unknown processes in tenuous clouds. Either case will make a significant impact on our understanding of the ice chemistry and/or star-formation process in our Galaxy. Their true nature remains uncertain based on the currently available data. The proposed molecular line spectroscopy with ALMA will distinguish their nature unambiguously.',\n"," 'ACA CO(2-1) mapping toward the nearest spiral galaxy M 33. The understanding of the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is one of the most fundamental issues in modern astronomy. Recent ALMA observations suggest that the formation of dense molecular gas and the growth of pc-scale filamentary structures play important roles in the evolution of GMCs. We propose to observe 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission lines over the molecular gas disk of the nearest spiral galaxy M 33 with the ACA stand-alone mode. Based on the ACA CO(2-1) maps at a spatial resolution of 27 pc, we identify more than 300 GMCs in M 33, and examine their 13CO(2-1)/12CO(2-1) intensity ratio and line widths of 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission. The 13CO(2-1)/12CO(2-1) intensity ratio is sensitive to molecular gas density and the line width of 13CO(2-1) may trace gas kinematics such as cloud-cloud collisions. Thus these two parameters, reflecting the dense-gas formation and the internal kinematics within the GMC, seem to be good indicators to estimate the evolutionary stage of the GMC in detail. Furthermore, the proposed GMC survey in M 33 with ACA provides the fundamental data to plan high-angular resolution observations toward individual GMCs with ALMA 12-m array.',\n"," 'Impacts of a global dust storm on Martian atmosphere. The most striking phenomenon on Mars is a planet-encircling storm, so-called \"Global dust storm\". Once it occurred, dust covers the whole atmosphere, and heats the atmosphere via absorption of solar radiation for more than one month. Our simulations predict that atmospheric temperature rises more than 20 K at 10-60 km altitude over the planet under the dust storms. Such a drastic heating in the atmosphere induces water vapor to remain without condensation, and accelerates dynamics. Moreover, Atreya et al (2006) predicted the amount of H2O2 could increase due to triboelectric filed under a global dust storm. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate how much change is induced in thermal structure, dynamics, water vapor abundances, and H2O2 amounts due to a global dust storm. We propose simultaneous observations of CO, HDO, and H2O2 using the ALMA band-7 during/after a global dust storm as a ToO observations. Through conscious monitoring of dust opacity by Mars Express spacecraft, we can trigger to carry out the observation in real-time. A new sensitive observation of dust-covered Martian atmosphere with ALMA will provide essential understanding in the Martian meteorology/climate.',\n"," 'The first kpc-scale map of the cold molecular ISM in a z=1.1 main sequence galaxy. We propose to map the low-J CO(2-1) line across the full disc of a carefully selected z=1.1 main sequence galaxy in the Hubble UDF at unprecedented 0.13\" (1 kpc) resolution. Our data will provide the first kpc-scale gas, velocity and dispersion map of any z~1 galaxy. The target is ideally suited for this project: it is detected in CO with the ASPECS large project, has rich ancillary data, and is sufficiently extended to be resolved with many dozens of beams. Combined with in-hand star formation tracer maps (Halpha, UV), we will carry out a pioneering study of the molecular clump lifecycle at the peak of cosmic star formation. Using the spatially-resolved relation between star formation and gas tracers on scales of only 1 kpc, we will make the first robust measurements outside of the local Universe of critical, hotly debated quantities, such as the clump lifetime, star formation efficiency, feedback timescale, feedback outflow velocity, mass loading factor and feedback efficiency. This project will address crucial open questions, such as the role of clumps in bulge growth, disc instability scales and the disc baryon fraction, and present a poster child of ALMAs unique capabilities.',\n"," 'Studying CO SLEDs of local LIRGs at 100 pc resolution. This program targets 12m+ACA observations of the CO (4-3), (6-5), (7-6), and (8-7) molecular gas line emission and continuum emission in bands 8 to 10, of a sample of 6 U/LIRGs. The main purpose of these observations is to recover and map the distribution of the warm gas at mid J transitions of these galaxies for the first time at ~ 100 pc resolution, a factor of ~60 improvement in resolution compared to existing Herschel observations. We will reveal for the first time the morphology of the highest excitation CO gas that can be accessed from the ground, and along with matched resolution lower J CO archival observations will provide the highest resolution low to mid-J CO SLED in local U/LIRGs. Modeling such SLEDs will provide accurate estimates of the density and temperature of the gas and overall mass distribution at 100 pc scales. These galaxies all have archival or approved JWST observations of mid-infrared vibrational molecular gas lines (H2), which will allow us to perform a multiphase census of the interstellar medium in local U/LIRGs at an unprecedented spatial resolution unachievable with previous IR observatories.',\n"," 'Robust estimates of the Molecular Hydrogen Mass in high-redshift Luminous Galaxies: Measurements of HF and CH. We propose to observe two optically thin molecular emission lines, the Hydrogen Fluoride, HF and the methylidyne radical, CH, in IRAS Z21293-0154, an Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) at z=0.73. These molecules have column densities very well correlated to the molecular hydrogen column density down to low optical extinctions, and can provide the most accurate estimates of the molecular hydrogen, H2, content in high-redshift galaxies. These measurements will allow us to: (a) test the accuracy of widely used tracers, such as Carbon Monoxide and dust mass, which suffer from systematics that are very hard to characterise; (b) study the velocity field of the interstellar medium of an ULIRG with realiable H2 tracers; (c) constrain the ISM physics included in galaxy formation simulations. This proposal would prove the feasibility of HF and CH as reliable and robust tracers of H2, which can then open a whole new field of studies of high-redshift galaxies using ALMA.',\n"," 'Direct Imaging of Vertical Structure in an Edge-on Protoplanetary Disk. Protoplanetary disks are proposed to be characterized by radial and vertical gradients in density, temperature, ionization, radiation flux and chemistry. Spatially resolved ALMA observations of molecular lines have confirmed the presence of radial temperature and chemical structures in disks, while constraints on the vertical structures remain scarce. We propose to exploit the exceptional spatial resolution of ALMA and the viewing geometry of the edge-on disk AA Tau to obtain the first direct imaging constraints on the vertical chemical and ionization structure in a protoplanetary disk. We will target molecules and ions proposed to trace the disk atmosphere, warm molecular layer and cold midplane to benchmark our understanding of how disk structures and chemistry depend on disk height.',\n"," 'The kpc-scale distribution of dust continuum emission in typical star-forming galaxies at z~1.. We propose to obtain 870um observations with ALMA at 0.2 arcsec resolution of seven (mildly) lensed star-forming galaxies, which lie on and off the main sequence and have a median stellar mass of log(Mstar/Msun) = 10.3, redshift of 1.2, and magnification factor of 2. By characterizing the structure of the interstellar medium of z~1 disks on kpc-scales, wil will look for morphological signatures of the physical mechanisms that drive their high SFR and lead to the assembly of present-day massive disks like the Milky-Way. Moreover, by combining these ALMA observations with existing HST (UV/optical) and VLA (3/6GHz) data, we will derive spatially resolved maps of dust attenuation to infer the dust-corrected SFR and stellar mass radial profiles. We will use this knowledge to contrast the distributions of stellar mass and SFR of galaxies on and off the main sequence, to link the level of star formation with structural changes across z~1 disks.',\n"," 'A new molecular gas mass tracer in galaxies: a first test in the local Universe. The fine structure lines of atomic carbon, [CI], stand out as the best alternative tracer of molecular gas in galaxies other than CO, because they have suitable range of critical densities, excitation temperatures, small optical depths, while the CI abundance is highly increased under the influence of strong cosmic rays (CR) due to the destruction of CO. However, they must be benchmarked locally against the widely used low-J CO transitions as global molecular gas tracers. We propose to image [CI] 1-0 and CO J=1-0 (with CN N=1--0 as bonus transitions) in three local luminous infrared galaxies, drawn from a population of dusty and vigorously star-forming galaxies, as good analogues of high-z sub-mm galaxies.This allows a sensitive assessment of the relative H2-tracing capabilities of [CI] 1-0, CO 1-0, and submm dust on 250 pc scales, and a search for the predicted CR-induced CO-destruction. The proposed study will open a new window to better determine molecular gas mass in galaxies, near and far.',\n"," 'Star formation suppression in recent minor mergers. In a hierarchical LambdaCDM universe mergers play a major role in the assembly of galaxies, inducing strong star formation, fuelling black-hole growth and morphologically transforming galaxies. Wet mergers are usually associated with strong starbursts, as gas dissipatively collapses to the galaxy centre. A recent paper by Davis et al. (2015) found a population of very gas rich galaxies, which have recently undergone a minor merger. Contrary to expectations these coalesced systems do not host strong starbursts. Instead star formation is suppressed by orders of magnitude, with gas depletion times that exceed the Hubble time. We propose to use ALMA to determine the underlying physical cause of this intriguing effect, distinguishing between dynamical suppression, gravitational heating and AGN/starburst feedback both kinematically and chemically. A small investment of ALMA time will allow us to place these objects on a suppression sequence, comparing them to more normal early-type and star-forming objects, and to purpose-built hydrodynamic simulations. In this way we can shed light on a physical process that can suppress and regulate star formation across the Universe.',\n"," 'First ALMA images of the water snowline on disk scales. Despite its key role in planet formation and the emergence of life, only three spatially resolved observations of water around young stars have been published, and all of them are pre-ALMA. Ultimately, astronomers want to image the water snowline, i.e., the radius at which gas-phase water freezes out onto dust grains, in protoplanetary disks, because this will allow predictions from planet formation models (e.g., about the formation of dust rings and the C/O ratio in planetary building blocks) to be tested observationally. However, water observations in mature disks are very challenging, so a first step is to image thermal water emission in more luminous protostellar sources on disk scales. We therefore proposed Cycle 5 observations of H218O toward four protostars as soon as Band 5 became operational, to directly image the water snowline. A second goal was to establish H13CO+ as an alternative tracer of the snowline. Unfortunately, only the H13CO+ observations were executed. We here propose to fulfill the key goal of the program by observing H218O toward the two best targets.',\n"," 'Can the observations probe the theory ? : the Case of Magnetic launching in Pre-Planetary nebulae. We propose to tackle the long standing issue regarding the role of magnetic field in the shaping of evolved intermediate mass stars. Indeed, several recent theoretical models (MHD) have shown that magnetic fields are important actors in the production of particular morphological structures (knots/protrusons) as well as in participating in the launch of the outflows/jets leading to bipolar or multipolar nebulae. We therefore aim at observing a set of proto Planetary Nebulae in order to trace their magnetic field distribution via dust continuum polarization studies close to their central engine. The results will be compared to the models and we expect to better undertand the departure from spherical symmetry that occurs in the late stages of stellar evolution.',\n"," 'The Vega debris disk: narrow ring or broad belt?. We propose to determine the distribution of mm grains (and, by implication, the parent planetesimals) in the Vega debris disk. Interferometric observations to date have not been able to detect the dust, and single-dish photometers reach somewhat contradictory conclusions: some indicating the presence of clumps, others not. Surprisingly, far-IR images show a much larger smooth structure, thought to be tracing small grains being blown out. But overall the results are inconclusive, which, for the eponymous Vega excess star, implies a big gap in our knowledge. Debris disks seem to be of two types, either a narrow ring (the more common structure, implying the presence of shepherding planets), or a broad belt (a more unusual type, suggesting no large planets). Taking existing Vega data seems to suggest (by inference) that Vega has a broad belt. But we dont really know. With ALMA data we can say for sure which is the case, and hence make major progress in understanding the dust dynamics and architecture of the first Vega excess star.',\n"," 'Quantifying the Feedback Potential of Young Massive Protoclusters. In a series of radio and infrared surveys, we have identified a sample of 20 massive protoclusters existing in a specific evolutionary state in which outflows dominate their infrared appearance. Our SMA millimeter data at 3\" resolution reveal high velocity CO emission (up to +-80 km/s) with complex morphology indicative of multiple actively-accreting protostars. We propose to test the theoretical idea that the combined outflow feedback is enough to maintain turbulence but not enough to disrupt the parental gas reservoir, thereby allowing star formation to proceed at a regulated rate. We will image 10 protoclusters on scales of 0.8\"-20\" for which we also have SOFIA mid-IR imaging observations. Using a set of outflow and hot core tracers, we will resolve individual outflows, identify their driving sources, and compute their momentum and energies. The combination of SOFIA and ALMA continuum imaging will enable measurements of the individual protostellar luminosities thereby allowing an accurate estimate of the contribution of radiative feedback. We will compare these results with the gravitational energy of the gas and the dynamical mass of the cluster.',\n"," 'Massive and dense clumps in early stages of evolution: mass distribution and turbulence. We have identified two massive and dense molecular clumps in early, but slightly different, stages of evolution: one in the quiescent phase and the other in the protostellar phase. Both clumps have line profiles exhibiting the blue asymmetry signature of global collapse. These are ideal objects to test current high-mass star formation models and to investigate the incidence of turbulence in clump evolution. We propose to observe four molecular lines (HCO+, H13CO+, CH3CN, N2H+) in the 3mm window, using both the 12m and 7m arrays, to measure temperatures, densities and gas dynamics of the molecular gas on both, the large (20´´) clump scale and small (2´´) core scale. These observations will allow us to determine the number and distribution of individual cores, their physical properties and dynamical state, as well as the density, temperature and velocity field of the large scale clump as a function of radius, which will give the large scale mass infall rate. The characteristics of both the global collapse and of the primordial fragmentation, together constitutes a key discriminator between the monolithic collapse and competitive accretion scenarios for high-mass star formation.',\n"," 'The Cluster Formation and Evolution Cycle of a Starburst-Driven Nuclear Outflow: The Case of NGC 7552. The complex interplay between feedback-driven outflows and their host galaxy ISM remains largely unconstrained at the relevant physical scales of individual star clusters. Here we propose to observe the nuclear starburst region of the nearby (D_L = 22 Mpc) luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG: LIR > 10^11 Lsun) NGC 7552, to measure the properties of ~20 embedded star clusters suggested from previous ATCA, SMA, and SINFONI imaging. As the only starbust LIRG for which ALMA can resolve individual clusters (0.1\" ~ 10pc), NGC 7552 represents the best laboratory to study the earliest phases of cluster formation and evolution in a truly extreme environment. Observations of the H40/42 recombination lines, CO (3-2) emission, and the continuum in Bands 3 and 7 allow us to estimate the gas mass, dust opacity, stellar content, and dynamical state of each massive cluster. The main question we will then address is: How do the derived cluster properties, and their inferred cluster formation efficiencies, change in this extreme starburst environment, and what is the impact of different types of feedback occurring in the youngest clusters still deeply enshrouded in their natal cocoons.',\n"," 'A complete CO survey of all known fast radio burst host galaxies at z < 0.15. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are among the least understood, enigmatic transients. Because the link between progenitors and specific environments is expected, observations of host galaxies are essential to constrain progenitor models. CO observations of host galaxies provide ISM properties in the environment of FRBs. In the past six months, three papers on CO observations have been published, indicating a high interest in and importance of CO observations. These studies based on 6-7 hosts suggest diverse molecular gas properties different from local star-forming galaxies. However, the difference is not significant due to the small sample size. Here we propose to observe CO(1-0) in 6 FRB hosts, doubling the sample size. We aim to statistically verify whether molecular gas properties differ from those of local star-forming galaxies or other galaxy populations (such as the hots of GRBs and SNe). The targets are unbiasedly selected from the accurately-localized, spectroscopically-confirmed hosts, well observable with ALMA, providing the complete CO sample of known FRB hosts at z < 0.15.',\n"," 'The Rosette protocluster: testing cluster formation theories. We propose ACA + TP Band 3 mosaic observations of the dense N2H+ gas in the Rosette protocluster. These data will sample physical scales down to ~0.08 pc at the distance of the Rosette (1.4 kpc). In combination with our recently accepted APOGEE2-S data measuring the young star radial velocities and our Herschel mass maps, we will use the dense gas spatial location and kinematics to test several radically different models for the formation and evolution of gas-dominated protoclusters: the \"Slingshot\", \"cold collapse\", gravity-dominated collapse, and the cluster merger scenario. We will identify both the successes and failure modes of these, providing essential constraints for theoretical investigations and numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of stellar protoclusters in the era of ALMA, APOGEE, and Gaia.',\n"," 'An ACA Survey of Molecular Gas in Mergers and Dual AGN. Major galaxy mergers are thought to play an important role in fueling supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. However, observational support for this hypothesis is mixed, with some studies showing a clear link between merging galaxies and luminous quasars and others showing no such association. Galaxy merger simulations and observations suggest dual AGN activity (Koss+12) and obscuration peak when the two galactic nuclei are close to each other. We propose a survey of all 34 nearby (z<0.05) hard X-ray selected AGN from Swift BAT in mergers (4-28 kpc) that can be resolved within a single 7m ACA observation at 230 Ghz (10-25 separation) and 100 Ghz (>25) to 1): study the role of molecular gas in AGN activation in mergers and 2) use continuum observations to search for highly obscured primary AGN and undiscovered obscured secondary AGN. These observations will perform the first large ACA study of AGN in mergers, quadrupling the number of dual AGN studied at wider separations (>5 kpc) and providing a critical comparison sample of single AGN in mergers.',\n"," 'Sub-Arcsec Molecular Gas Imaging of the z=2.8 Submillimeter Galaxy SMM J02399-0136. We propose sub-arcsec imaging of the molecular gas in the z=2.8 submillimeter galaxy (SMG) SMM J02399-0136, the very first SMG discovered with a confirmed counterpart. This remarkable system is a merger of two hyper-luminous infrared sources with AGN feedback that appears to be enhancing the star-formation activity in the system. We request Band-3 and Band-6 imaging observations with a resolution of 0.45\" (~1.5 kpc in the source frame), which is sufficient to distinguish between the various components of the system and to study the possible interaction of the QSO with the red starburst region as well as the surrounding large blue Ly-alpha cloud. We propose to observe the CO(3-2), HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3), CO(7-6), and [CI] spectral lines to determine the molecular gas mass, gas excitation, kinematics, dense-gas fraction, and star-formation efficiencies of the system. The 3.3 mm and 1.3 mm continuum observations when combined with the archival ALMA Band-9 data will reveal the distribution of the dust mass associated with the various components.',\n"," 'Sub-kpc mapping of the [CII]/dust in the highest-redshift ULIRG at z=7.3. Recent studies have revealed the existence of particularly massive galaxies within the first Gyr after the Big Bang. These galaxies push the limits of galaxy evolution models, but detailed physical studies have been limited due to a lack of bright, spectroscopically-confirmed targets. Excitingly, ALMA has now discovered a massive (M_*=1.3x10^10 Msol), extremely [CII]- and IR-luminous galaxy (L_[CII]=2.0x10^9 Lsol, L_IR=1.1x10^12 Lsol) at z=7.3 -- the highest-redshift ULIRG known to-date. This exceptional source shows a clear [CII] velocity gradient, a clumpy UV morphology, and a possible outflow/companion, but the current ALMA data are too low-resolution to determine the mechanism(s) powering its extreme IR luminosity or how it is building its stellar mass. We propose sub-kpc (0.15/780pc) imaging of the [CII] and dust continuum in order to reveal the morphology and kinematics of the gas and dusty star formation. Together with the existing HST imaging and approved JWST NIRSpec/IFU imaging -- which will map the unobscured stellar emission on similar scales -- the proposed observations will provide an unprecedented view of massive galaxy formation just 700Myr after the Big Bang.',\n"," 'Investigating the Multi-Phase ISM in SDP.11 at z ~ 1.8: Gas Physics on Sub-kpc Scales Using Gravitational Lensing. We propose a detailed study of the ionized, atomic, and molecular gas in SDP.11, a gravitationally lensed, high-z, Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) analog, at z=1.783. The combination of this fortuitous lensing configuration and redshift allow us to map the [CI] 609 um, [CI] 370 um, CO(4-3), CO(7-6), and [NII] 122 um lines with ALMA, at sub-kiloparsec resolution. These lines, combined with our existing [CII] ALMA observations, ionized gas lines from Herschel, and multi-band radio free-free emission data, will allow us to estimate the ambient stellar UV radiation field strength, PDR gas densities, molecular gas density, temperature and mass, dust mass and temperature, and absolute [N/H] abundances, at sub-kiloparsec resolution across the source, as well as to determine the source-averaged stellar radiation field hardness. By probing the gas physics of SDP.11 in all phases of the ISM, ionized, atomic, and molecular, we will learn more about the ways in which massive galaxies rapidly produced their stars near the peak of the cosmic star formation history.',\n"," 'Molecular gas excitation in z=0.7 main sequence galaxies. Recent CO observations in normal main-sequence galaxies at high redshift have shown that their star formation efficiency is lower than in case of merger driven SMGs, more consistent with the star formation efficiency in local spiral galaxies. The picture that emerges from this studies is that SMGs form stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more compressed so they churn more quickly through the available gas reservoir than the typical normal high-z disk galaxies. These differences in the physical conditions of the ISM are expected to affect the CO and CI line ratios. Our very first results from cycle 2 indeed show an unusual CI(2--1)/CO(7--6) line ratio, which indicates low gas densities in line with the expectation of diffuse gas in extended disks. A coherent picture of the gas excitation in main sequence systems, however, is missing so far. We here ask to continue our study of the gas excitation in main-sequence galaxies selected from the PHIBSS survey and to observe a small sample of z=0.7 galaxies. Our study aims to provide for the first time well characterized templates of the gas excitation in high redshift main-sequence galaxies.',\n"," 'Pushing ALMA to the limit: 100pc imaging of spectacular [CII] cavities in a z=6.6 quasar host galaxy. Recently, we reported high spatial resolution (~0.076\",410pc) ALMA imaging of the dust continuum and [CII] line in a luminous quasar host galaxy at z=6.6. The unprecedented high resolution of the observations reveals a complex morphology of gas within 3 kpc of the accreting central black hole. Strikingly, we locate impressive [CII] cavities in the gas distribution (with diameters of 0.5kpc), offset from the black hole. The current data are insufficient in resolution to determine if they are created by interactions with nearby galaxies (leading to broad tidal features), or due to energy injection by the central accreting black hole (leading to confined, narrow shock fronts). Given the brightness of the [CII] emission on 400pc scales, observations at an incredible 100 pc resolution (0.02\" in C43-9/C43-10) to resolve the rims of the these cavities are now within reach. This resolution also matches the sizes of regions that give birth to super star clusters in the galaxy and will allow us to zoom into the central region harboring the black hole. The proposed observations will showcase the unprecedented capabilities of ALMA in studying a forming massive galaxy in the reionization epoch.',\n"," 'Atmospheric chemistry on Venus: Diurnal variation of chlorine species. Understanding the atmospheric chemistry on Venus is important to elucidate the atmospheric evolution of the terrestrial-like planets. CO2 cycle is one of the most important and fundamental processes in Venus atmosphere. It controls the stability of Venus atmosphere, which currently remains a puzzling issue on how to effectively reproduce CO2 from O and CO. It is theoretically predicted that ClOx species play a catalytic role in this process; however, there are no observational confirmations yet on such chlorine radical species in Venus. We propose simultaneous observations of HCl and ClO using the ALMA band-9 receiver. The primary goal of this proposal is to observe the spatial distribution and the characteristics of diurnal behavior of HCl in Venus mesosphere, and to detect day and night variation of ClO abundances with taking the advantage of limb viewing geometry that significantly improves the observation sensitivity to low concentration molecules. HCl is the reservoir of active chlorine, and determination of its accurate abundance is essential to understand the chlorine chemistry in Venus. Recent JCMT observations of the vertical profile of mesospheric HCl have brought a surprising finding that the HCl abundance drops quickly above 80 km whereas the photochemical model calculations predict a more vertically constant HCl profile [Sandor and Clancy, Icarus, 2012]. This implies that there might be more effective photochemical destruction of HCl than the model assumes, or there might be a strong downward flow to dynamically remove HCl from the upper atmosphere. A sensitive mapping of HCl distribution and observations of its diurnal variation will provide new and strong constraints on the chemical transport modeling of HCl, and thus improves the estimate of how much total chlorine exist in Venus. ClO is one of the most effective sources of active chlorine, and its distribution is considered to directly link to ClCOx which are possible key accelerator in the CO2 reproduction reaction. A firm detection of ClO is the first must-do step to establish a better picture of ClOx catalytic reactions.',\n"," 'Gamma-ray Burst Physics with ALMA: Direct Implications for the Explosions and Progenitors. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous explosions in the Universe, and thus serve as unique laboratories for high-energy astrophysics and compact-object formation, as well as premier probes of the high-redshift universe. Observations of GRB \"afterglows\" provide critical insight into the energy scale and local environment of the bursts, thereby elucidating the explosion mechanism and nature of the progenitors. However, the existing extensive optical/X-ray afterglow data alone are degenerate with respect to these GRB properties. Millimeter and centimeter observations are critical for breaking these degeneracies, but pre-ALMA GRB follow-up has yielded a mm-band detection rate of <5%. We have begun to remedy the dearth of mm-band detections through our Cycle 4 ALMA pilot programs, which were successful in detecting and characterizing mm emission from GRB 161219B. Following on this success, we now propose a mm-band survey comprising ALMA ToO observations of 5 GRBs to begin to address key unsolved questions. We will support these ALMA data with JVLA observations (30 hours), extensive optical follow-up (Gemini, Magellan, MMT, Keck), and X-ray monitoring (Swift, Chandra, XMM).',\n"," 'The Fomalhaut Asteroid Belt - Resolving the Traces of Terrestrial Planets. Fomalhaut plays an important role in studying debris disks and small bodies in other planetary systems. The proximity and luminosity of the star place key features of its debris system within uniquely clear view where detailed disk structures can be directly linked to its planetary configuration. In this proposal, we aim to resolve its asteroid belt at 345 GHz (870 μm), a warm disk component whose existence has been inferred from the observations by Spitzer, Herschel and ALMA, for the first time. The resolved image will allow us precisely determine the physical location and geometry (eccentricity and position offset relative to the star) of the warm belt, providing new insights into its nature and any unseen planets that might gravitationally shepherd the inner planetary system in Fomalhaut.',\n"," 'Star-formation activity in host galaxies of the most luminous QSOs in the Universe. We propose to observe 14 of the most luminous (L_bol>10^14 L_sun) optically identified quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) in the Universe in order to determine their far-infrared (far-IR) luminosity and constrain the star-formation rate in their host galaxies. The targets have high bolometric luminosities close to the theoretical maximum QSO luminosity (3x10^10 L_sun) based on maximum black hole mass and the Eddington luminosity limit. Four of these fourteen targets have redshifts such that the [CII] 158 micron line, the brightest emission line in the interstellar medium and another important tracer of star formation, falls into ALMA Band 9 or Band 7. We propose to observe the [CII] emission line in these four targets, and the far-IR continuum in all fourteen. By estimating the star-formation rate in the host galaxies of these QSOs, we will place them in context of merger-based galaxy evolution and QSO feedback models, which predict a burst of star-formation activity to occur at the same time that a QSO radiates at maximum luminosity.',\n"," 'Revolutionary insights into the z>7 gas and dust physics. Although high-z galaxy sample sizes with FIR line and dust continuum detections have known a boost with ALMA, the characterisation of their gas and dust reservoirs remains elusive. We propose to target five FIR lines ([OIII]52,[NII]122,[OI]145,[CI]370,CO7-6) and the underlying dust continuum in the brightest [CII]-, [OIII]88- and dust-detected z=7.306 galaxy (UVISTA-Y-003). This ambitious program will allow us to unambiguously constrain the gas densities, ionisation parameter, ionising photon escape fraction, molecular gas mass and gas-phase O, C and N abundances. We will gain unprecedented insights into the early metal and dust enrichment, the efficiency of star formation, and the contribution of massive galaxies to cosmic reionisation. The exquisite sampling of the rest-frame 52-370 micron dust SED comes for free, and will enable us - for the first time - to cover the z>7 dust SED peak and to constrain the dust temperature, mass and IR luminosity with high precision. The IR luminosity will be crucial to interpret the IRX-beta diagram; whereas the metal and dust masses will allow us to tie down the dominant dust production sources and the importance of gas accretion and outflows.',\n"," 'Structure and properties of the molecular gas in LMC-N11B. We propose to map 12CO(1-0) in the star-forming region N11B in the Large Magellanic Cloud. N11B is a unique case of multiple sequential star formation in a nearby metal-poor system. We aim to examine the structure of the molecular gas with ALMA and to use the synergy with Herschel to solve the long-standing paradigm of photodissociation regions in low-metallicity environments. There is growing evidence that CO traces a small filling factor (<10%) of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the form of small clumps. On the other hand, the photodissociated envelopes can harbor a significant fraction of the molecular gas H2 - necessary to fuel star formation - accountable via FIR cooling lines such as [CII] 158um. Our objectives are to: - identify the CO clumps, study their size and mass distribution as a function of the environment (e.g., feedback from the massive star clusters and the impact on the propagation of star formation under extremely porous ISM conditions). - examine the [CII]/CO(1-0) ratio and construct a PDR model. We will quantify the mass of CO-dark molecular gas and shed new light on the metallicity dependence of the conversion factor between CO and H2.',\n"," 'Reveal the 10~au scale substructures in two protostellar disks. Small-scale substructures, including spiral arms and misaligned/wrapped inner disk, have been found in cirumstellar disks around low-mass protostars when they are still in a disk forming phase (Class 0/I). To study these substructures is important for our understanding of star/planet formation and origin of multiplicity. In the intermediate mass star forming region NGC2071IR, we have identified two sources (IRS1, IRS3) with strong evidence of disk substructures at a few 10AU scale. IRS1 is an intermediate mass protostellar system (3Msun',\n"," 'Investigating Disk Disruption and Mass Outflow Triggered by Binary Orbital Motion: The Important Case of T Tauri South. T Tauri is the eponymous member of its class of young sun-like stars. This remarkable triple star system has become a veritable laboratory for modeling dynamics in young star multiples. Imaging of its outflows reveals periodic mass ejections. Correlation of the outflow kinematics with the historical orbit timing of T Tau South binary (period 27 yr) suggests a fascinating prospect: the launch of the southern outflow ejections may be nearly contemporaneous with the close-binary periastron passage. As such, T Tau provides an amazing opportunity to study tidal disk disruption and launch of a new outflow with the upcoming binary periastron passage in 2023. With 10 hours of ALMA time, we propose to make a new measurement of the T Tau system near to the 2023 periastron passage. This will provide a critical opportunity to measure disk disruption and study the circumstellar gas and dust (inner and circumbinary disks, jets/outflows). Cycle 9 overlaps with the periastron time frame, hence this project is time critical. The next opportunity to study T Tau periastron passage at this level will be in 27 years.',\n"," 'Following the energy trail with CH+ in strongly lensed starburst galaxies before cosmic noon. Whatever its origin - stellar or AGN feedback, gravity - turbulence acts as a long-lived mass energy buffer and is a critical process regulating the growth of galaxies in the early universe. Large turbulent reservoirs of diffuse molecular gas have been detected with CH+(1-0) absorption lines against the dust continuum emission of strongly lensed sub-mm galaxies (SMG) at z~2.5. They extend to up to 40 kpc from the SMGs. Extremely broad CH+(1-0) emission lines trace shocks at the interface of galactic winds and the circum-galactic medium (CGM). Thanks to the unique properties of CH+, the major energy releases can be quantified and a steady-state regime of star formation is found in these SMGs in which a gas mass inflow rate comparable to the star formation rate is required to sustain the mass and turbulent luminosity of the CGM over the duration of the starburst phase. Here, we extend the search for CH+(1-0) lines in 18 strongly lensed SMGs, at earlier epochs, 4',\n"," 'The life of post-starburst galaxies at z~0.7: constraining the quenching mechanisms from stars and gas. In the last years, ALMA has started to probe the gas content in massive galaxies with low star-formation rates beyond the local universe. While the statistics are building up, the next step will be understanding the physical reasons that set the gas content in these galaxies. We propose to observed 6 massive post-starburst galaxies at z~0.7. The star-formation activities in these galaxies just shut down in the recent past, providing the best proxies to access the phsyical condition when the transition happened. All our targets have ultra-deep spectra, multi-wavelength photometry, and HST images for deriving accurate star-formation histories, stellar kinematics, morphologies, and star-formation rates. This is a rare sample for the joint study of stars, gas, and star-formation activities. We will derive the time evolution of gas content, the correlation between morphology and gas mass, and the relation between the stellar and gas kinematics during the key phase of galaxy evolution. These results will put stringent constraints on mechanisms that shut off the star-formation beyond the local universe.',\n"," 'On the brink of star formation. ALMA Cycle 2, Band 6, has provided the first detection of sub-structure in a pre-stellar core. Within the central 1000 AU, we found a core nucleus of ~0.2 Msun and unresolved clumps at scales <200 AU (seeds), whose nature needs further observations to be assessed, but their sole existence is challenging classical star formation theories. The seeds may be compact and warm structures, heated by gravitational compression, or cold local density enhancements. To unveil their nature, we plan to observe the dust continuum emission in Bands 7 and 3. Also, our Cycle 2 observations have shown that N2D+ and DCO+ are not tracing the core nucleus, possibly because of complete molecular freeze-out, or very low ionisation degree due to reduced cosmic-ray flux. To test this, we plan to observe the volatile ortho-H2D+ and the neutral para-NH2D. The selected species will allow us to test cosmic-ray propagation theories and trace the central kinematics. This project opens up the long-awaited opportunity to study the initial conditions for stellar system formation up to unprecedented small scales and to test dynamical/chemical models of evolving pre-stellar cores.',\n"," 'Characterizing the Gas Surface Density and CO Abundance Strucutre in Disks with Known Gas Masses. In this era of high resolution spectrocopic observations there is an emerging picture of substantial reprocessing of volatile elements in protoplanetary disks. Unraveling this story of volatile reprocessing, and its implications for the composition of forming planets, requires a solid understanding of the inital atomic reserviors, such as CO for carbon. However, determing if CO has been reprocessed requires knowledge of the total disk gas mass. We prospose to observe 13CO 6-5, C180 6-5, 13CO 3-2, and C18O 3-2 in DM Tau and GM Aur, the only two systems besides TW Hya whose total disk mass is well constrained by unresolved observations of HD, an excellent tracer of H2. Using these data we will derive a radial temperature profile and constrain the total gas surface density profile. We will then use the same observations to map the CO abundance in these systems, allowing us to quantify and identify spatial variations in the extent of CO reprocessing. Our groups previous analysis of similar observations in TW Hya directly resolve the surface CO snowline and constrain the CO freeze-out temperature to <21 K.',\n"," 'High resolution observations of deuterated hydrocarbons in protoplanetary disks. Deuterium enrichment is a common phenomenon seen in Solar System material. Because deuterium enrichment is caused by exchange reactions in low temperature environments, it has been inferred that at least some Solar System material could originate from the interstellar medium such as molecular clouds. Deuterium enrichment is expected in the cold outer region of protoplanetary disks as well. Since protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planetary bodies, e.g., planets and comets, it is important to investigate deuterium chemistry in disks to understand the origin and thermal history of molecules that are eventually incorporated intoplanetary bodies. The deuterium chemistry in protoplanetary disks is, however, still not fully understood. In this proposal, we will observe the deuterated hydrocarbons C2D and c-C3HD toward three protoplanetary disks. We will resolve the radial distribution of these molecules and molecular D/H ratios as a function of temperature. This allows us to investigate the contribution from multiple pathways to the deuterium enrichment in protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'Probing the Formation of Nuclear Stellar Cusps. We propose observations with ALMA to spectroscopically map the molecular gas and dust that is associated with the build up of nuclear cusps in late merger stages of Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs). Our Hubble Space Telescope (HST) near-IR imaging program of the GOALS survey has recently spatially resolved the nuclear stellar structure in 88 LIRGs and revealed an increasing fraction of strong cusps towards late merger stages. ALMA will spatially resolve the morphology of the gas components of the cusp on a scale comparable to that of the HST. We have selected the five strongest cusp galaxies in our sample and a well matched comparison sample of five pre-cusp galaxies. The aim of this proposal is to unveil the molecular gas morphology (CO) and mechanisms associated with cusp formation and to accurately measure how much gas mass is involved in the build-up of stellar cusps. The decomposition of the gas kinematics will provide an unprecedented spatial measurement of the mass-to-light ratio of nuclear cusps and cores, providing a crucial test whether the central dark matter distribution is affected by the cusp/core evolution as seen in the stellar component or not.',\n"," 'The spatial distribution and gas kinematics traced by multiple ISM diagnostics in a quasar-starburst system at z = 6. We propose ALMA multi-band observations of multi-CO transitions and [O I]146um line and the dust continuum emission toward the quasar-starburst system J2310+1855 at z = 6.0031 at identical sensitivity and resolution of 0.2\". The proposed lines are well studied with ALMA low-resolution observations, however the spatially resolved gas/dust properties and gas kinematics traced by multi-phase ISM is still unknown. With the proposed high-resolution ALMA observations (1) we will compare the spacial distribution and the extent among different ISM tracers, simulation results, and across the cosmic time. (2) we will study resolved [O I]-FIR deficit to find the nature of the reduced [O I], and resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation to determine whether the star formation law for this target have any deviations. (3) With image decomposition, we are able to investigate the heating mechanism (star formation and/or AGN) of the ISM. (4) We will investigate the kinematic properties (e.g., rotation velocity, gas velocity dispersion, gas disk inclination and position angle) traced by different ISM diagnostics with identical resolution and sensitivity.',\n"," 'The [CI] lines as dynamical tracers: rotation, outflow, and heating mechanisms in a massive AGN-host starburst at z=2.6. In Cycle 2 we detected molecular gas in the AGN-host starburst galaxy PKS 0529-549 at z=2.6, using the [CI](2-1) line. The [CI] emission is consistent with a rotating disk: 3D models give a strikingly high Vrot/sigma=10, similar to local galaxy disks. The spatial resolution of the ALMA data (0.4\"x0.3\"), however, severely limits the interpretation: we cannot categorically exclude other scenarios like a galaxy merger. Moreover, integral-field spectroscopy from SINFONI shows that PKS 0529-549 has an outflow of ionized gas, aligned with two radio lobes, but this is not evident in the current [CI] data. We propose for follow-up observations of both [CI] lines at 0.1\" resolution. This will allow us to unambiguously probe the gas kinematics: we will trace the rotation curve (distribution of baryons and dark matter) and investigate the possible molecular phase of the outflow. The ratio of the two [CI] lines will provide the kinetic temperature of the gas, which will be compared to the dust temperature to study gas heating mechanisms. This program will constrain theoretical models of stellar and AGN feedback and provide key insights in the formation and evolution of massive galaxies.',\n"," 'Testing the Anisotropy of Turbulence in Protoplanetary Disks. Turbulence is a key actor for evolution of protoplanetary disks and formation of planets. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding turbulence and its properties via 3D MHD simulations, these predictions still has to be observationally constrained. We propose here to test one of the predictions of MHD models, the amount of anisotropy of the turbulence by observations of two disks, one face-on (TW Hya), one edge-on (Flying Saucer). The unique combination of high spatial and spectral resolving power and sensitivity of the Cycle 2 ALMA will allow us to image simultaneously CS 5-4, CN 2-1 and 12CO J=2-1, and characterize distributions of turbulent velocities through these disks.',\n"," 'Kinematic Diversity at z~1.6: Resolving CO (2-1) in Gas-rich Cluster Galaxies. We have produced some of the first exquisite velocity maps of molecular gas in high-z cluster galaxies using ALMA. These Cycle 5 data, delivered to us within the past month, are rich in information. With only a single pointing, we have spatially-resolved CO 2-1 in 8 cluster galaxies on ~3 kpc scales, and discovered a diversity of kinematic structure. We aim to further exploit this efficient multiplexing strategy by targeting two new clusters at z~1.6. Our proposed observations include 7 gas-rich cluster galaxies with enhanced molecular gas fractions, drawn from Noble et al. (2017), and an additional 17 spectroscopically-confirmed star-forming cluster galaxies, all within 3 ALMA pointings in Band 3. With the first large sample of spatially- and velocity-resolved CO (2-1) in z>1.5 clusters, we will characterize the fraction of ordered versus kinematically-complex galaxies, and compare global molecular gas features to that of the stellar component. As demonstrated with our pilot study in Cycle 5, ALMA is well-positioned to unequivocally map high-z molecular gas in great detail; targeting known gas-rich cluster galaxies at z~1.6 harnesses this potential in <20 hours.',\n"," 'Twins at heart? The centre of M83 as a Milky Way analogue. Detailed studies of the inner few 100 pc of the Millky Way are revolutionising our understanding of SF in extreme environments and feeding/feedback cycles in galactic nuclei. However, future developments are limited by the fact that we lie in the disc of our Galaxy, making it difficult to unambiguously determine the 3D geometry of gas and stars, and that the Galactic centre only provides a single snapshot of an evolutionary cycle. We seek to exploit M83s remarkable similarity with the Milky Way to overcome these limitations. ALMA observations will uniquely allow us to derive the density and pressure evolution of gas falling into the nucleus of M83 and determine (i) the dominant physical mechanisms regulating the mass flows and energy cycles down to the sizescales of individual clouds, and (ii) whether the star-forming clouds and stellar clusters follow an evolutionary time-sequence, which has been hypothesised to result from a tidal compression that triggers collapse.',\n"," 'Tracing the Origins of Oxygen-bearing Organics toward Orion KL. The formation of complex oxygen-bearing organics in the interstellar medium remains elusive, in particular methanol (CH3OH) which is at the center of many proposed formation pathways. CH3OH is ubiquitous in the interstellar medium hence is often used as a reference for complex molecular abundances. Theoretical studies suggest that CH3OH is formed on the surface of icy grains from the addition of H atoms to CO. We propose to elucidate the nature of this formation by mapping the D/H ratio of CH3OH isotopologues (CH2DOH and CH3OD) toward the Orion Kleinnmann-Low nebula (Orion KL), the archetype of star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Mapping the temperature structure and D/H ratios of both CH2DOH and CH3OD will show [1] the nature of the addition of hydrogen/deuterium to CO and [2] subsequent chemical reaction at the -OH site. The proposed observations will shed light on the origin of complex oxygen-bearing organics in the interstellar medium.',\n"," 'A first study of inner rotation curves in cluster galaxies at z=1.5. Inner rotation curves of galaxies are sensitive to the gravitational potential of a bulge in the central 1 kpc regions of galaxies. We here propose to make 0.15 arcsec(1 kpc)-resolution observations of CO(5-4) emission line in 16 cluster galaxies at z=1.46, in which the CO(2-1) line emission is detected. We will spatially resolve the CO(5-4) emission and explore the gas kinematics of high density gas in cluster galaxies. The combination of the 0.15 arcsec-resolution CO(5-4) and previous 0.5arcsec-resolution CO(2-1) observations will allow us, for the first time, to probe the radial distributions of baryonic mass (gas and stars) over a wide range from the central 1 kpc regions to the outer disks and to accurately determine the bulge-to-disk mass ratio in high-redshift cluster galaxies, which are expected to grow into massive elliptical galaxies in the present-day Universe.',\n"," 'Characterizing Chemical Composition of the Isolated Low-Mass Protostellar Core B335. B335 is a low-mass protostar in an isolated condition, and has been subject to extensive studies on star formation processes as an ideal target. On the other hand, its chemical compositions have not been investigated in detail. Our recent observation with ALMA at a 0.5\" resolution has revealed that B335 harbors various complex organic molecules (COMs) such as HCOOCH3, NH2CHO, and (CH3)2CO in the vicinity of the protostar, indicating that this source is definitively a hot corino source characterized by rich COMs. The lines of COMs and related species show very broad line width. Since the COMs are most likely evaporated from dust grains at the temperature higher than 100 K, we can constrain the size of the emitting region from the observed flux density to be larger than 17 AU. Hence, we will be able to resolve it at a resolution of 0.1\" (10-15 AU) at least partly. With this motivation, we propose to observe the COMs line at this resolution to explore their distribution and kinematics. The result will make essential contributions in characterizeing physical properties and chemical compositions of this important source.',\n"," 'Black Hole Masses, central parsec gas dynamics, and Event Horizon Detectability in a sample of nearby galaxies. Despite it now being well established that nearly all galaxies have a central black hole whose mass scales with the host galaxy properties, we do not have a complete understanding of the physics at work. In particular, we do not know whether black holes, or galaxies, are the driving the scaling relations. Although we know that the M-sigma and M-L relations are incompatible in the largest galaxies, we do not know which is wrong. We are now at the limits of what can be learned with ~80 data points with substantial measurement uncertainties, and urgently require additional precision data. ALMA is capable of measuring black hole masses at high precision for a large number of sources. Here, we propose observations of a modest pilot sample of nearby galaxies in order to: (1) Measure black hole masses in 3 new sources with large angular spheres of influence, (2) measure the central parsec gas dynamics in most or all 8 sources allowing us to better understand the systematics in molecular line black hole mass measurements, and (3) determine suitability for all sources for event horizon shadow resolution with the Event Horizon Telescope.',\n"," 'The Pre-Stellar Core Mass Function with Deuterium Chemistry in an Infrared Dark Cloud. RESUBMISSION OF CYCLE 2 B-RATED PROPOSAL, WITHDRAW IF COMPLETED IN CYCLE 2. Similarities between the shapes of the core mass function (CMF) and the stellar initial mass function have been noted, which may reveal a fundamental aspect of the star formation process. However, the relation of these \"cores\", typically observed via their dust continuum emission, and the pre-stellar cores (PSC) that will actually form stars is unclear. Here we propose to measure the PSC mass function by mapping N2D+(3-2) over a contiguous region of an IRDC that we have already observed in N2H+ with CARMA and in which we have already identified at least two relatively massive N2D+ PSCs with ALMA in Cycle 0. We expect to identify ~75 N2D+ cores, and measure masses via mm continuum emission, mid-infrared extinction and virial methods. We will carry out astrochemical modeling of the cores to estimate deuteration ages, which can help de-bias the observed PSC mass function to obtain the true PSC mass function. We will also study the chemical evolution from PSCs to protostellar cores. Finally, we will measure core-to-core kinematics and compare with simulations of molecular cloud turbulence.',\n"," 'Towards improved constraints on dark matter with strongly lensed quasars. Gravitationally lensed quasars have been established as a method to detect and quantify low-mass dark matter haloes at cosmological distances. The population of low-mass haloes is dependent on the mass of the dark matter particle, thus investigations of these lenses can give independent constraints on warm dark matter. We have an ongoing a programme to make competitive inferences on the halo mass function with short observations of lensed quasars with ALMA. Here, we ask for snapshot observations to identify new lens systems suitable for high-resolution follow-up in our programme. We estimate that we will detect at least 12 of these systems based on a previous large survey. If most of these sample are suitable targets, we estimate that we can put a constaint on the thermal relic mass of warm dark matter that is significantly more stringent than the current limits from lensing and other inferences after high-resolution follow-up. As we require only snapshot observations of these targets at any angular resolutions >0.5 arcsec in band 6, our programme is suitable for filler time scheduling.',\n"," 'The Effect of Extreme Environment on Protoplanetary Disks in Orion. Protoplanetary disks, or \"proplyds\" are the sites where new Solar systems are born. While most disk studies to date have focused on regions like Taurus and Ophiuchus for their proximity, stars rarely form in such isolated environments. In fact, there is clear evidence that our own Sun formed near a clustered OB association like Orion. To understand how planets form it is imperative that we study disk properties in regions representative of their origins. For this reason, we propose to survey the protoplanetary disks (\"proplyds\") around 295 young stars in Orion in order to study fundamental disk properties in a massive star forming region. ALMA is uniquely capable of imaging dust and gas emission from the Orion proplyds with its combination of high frequency, sensitivity, resolution and spatial filtering properties. We will measure the masses and survival timescales of these disks, study their molecular gas emission and spatially resolve the dust emission of the largest disks in Orion in order to determine their surface density profiles. The results of such observations will provide a detailed view into how the clustered environment and UV radiation affect disk properties and evolution, and ultimately, allow us to assess the potential to form Solar system analogs in a massive star forming region.',\n"," 'The CO Excitation of Milky Way Progenitors at z=1.2-1.3. We have recently used ALMA to make the first measurements of CO(3-2) emission in \"typical\" (lower-mass) star-forming galaxies at z=1.2-1.3. These galaxies were carefully selected from deep near-IR imaging to have the stellar mass (Log M*/Msol = 10.2) and SFR (20 Msol/yr) of Milky Way progenitors. They sit on the star-forming main sequence, and are therefore characteristic of the star-forming population. Here, we propose ALMA observations of CO(5-4) and CO(2-1) for three of these galaxies. The galaxies detected CO(3-2) emission implies large reservoirs of molecular gas, where the gas mass exceeds the stellar mass. This interpretation is hindered by the complete lack of constraints on the gas excitation, and this could lead to errors in the conversion to total gas mass. We will measure the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) from the new CO(5-4) and CO(2-1) data, and existing CO(3-2) data, providing the first measurement of CO excitation in lower mass star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. We will use the CO SLED to constrain the physical conditions in the gas, and test for variations compared to the more massive galaxies that have been studied previously.',\n"," 'The first molecular line inventory in hybrid disks. The transition from the late phase of protoplanetary disks to young debris disks remains a poorly explored evolutionary stage of planet-forming disks. The new class of \"hybrid\" disks, recently discovered by our team, includes disks with debris disk-like dust properties but having primordial gas content. These disks may represent the protoplanetary to debris disk transition. In order to establish how the chemical properties evolve, we propose to study all four hybrid disks discovered so far, together with five evolved Herbig Ae systems with relatively low gas content as comparison targets. The observations will provide the first inventory of the most important and best observable molecules in these disks. We will characterize their morphology and kinematics, and perform a detailed chemical analysis using our ANDES and ALCHEMIC chemistry codes adapted to these disks. Our program will reveal the chemistry of an independent evolutionary path for the gas component around A-type stars. The measurements are expected to provide final proofs that the gas in hybrid disks is the direct residual of the gas in the Herbig disks.',\n"," 'An attempt to resolve the entangled filaments and dense cores in the high-mass star formation of N159. Our ALMA cycle1 observations toward N159, one of the most active star forming regions in the LMC, have revealed various signatures of on-going massive star formation. We have discovered young molecular outflows toward two high-luminosity YSOs, and this is the first discovery of molecular outflows in external galaxies. We have also found an indication of filamentary cloud-cloud collision which triggered high-mass star formation; a high-mass YSO with the outflow and another high-mass star with a compact HII region are formed at the intersection of two/three filaments. Here, we propose ALMA observations toward brightest 4 high-mass YSOs in N159 region at an very high angular resolution of 0.28\"(0.07pc) in order to acquire deeper insights into the O star formation and their feedback on the natal gas by spatially resolving the structure. These observations will allow us to disentangle more complicated filamentary distribution including N159W-N, and to reveal significant details of the dense cores in this most active star formation in the Local Group.',\n"," 'Molecular gas and obscured SFR in a typical sub-L* galaxy at z=6. Accurate estimates of the mass and properties of the cold gas in distant normal star-forming galaxies are the key to understand how they grow, but also a challenge at z~3-6 due to their faintness. Here we propose an in-depth analysis of a strongly lensed sub-L* galaxy at z=6 to measure its molecular gas and obscured SFR content. The [CII] emission securely identified two lensed images in the ALMA Large Cluster Survey due to their magnification (20-160). The target is intrinsically faint and representative of low-mass galaxies at the end of reionization (M*~1e9 Msun, SFR~5 Msun/yr, much lower than any [CII]-detected source at z~6). We will (1) determine the molecular gas mass using [CI](2-1) and the dust in the Rayleigh Jeans tail, cross-calibrating the estimates from [CII], CO(1-0) (scheduled at VLA), and the dynamical mass (with ALMA+approved JWST); (2) estimate the obscured SFR via the LIR-LCO(7-6) relation and by modeling the dust emission; (3) provide a benchmark (also on resolved scale) for the ISM conditions and the dust temperature in typical sub-L* galaxies at z=6 with CO/CI/CII and continuum ratios, creating a reference template for future studies of statistical samples.',\n"," 'Examining the molecular coma of comet C/2012 K1 (PanSTARRS). Cometary ices contain pristine material from the formation of the solar system, and studies of their composition provide unique information regarding the physical and chemical conditions of the early Solar Nebula. Use of gas-phase coma observations as probes of cometary ices requires a complete understanding of the gas-release mechanisms, but previous observations have been unable to ascertain the precise origin of fundamental coma species CO, H2CO, HCN, HNC and CS, and details regarding their possible formation in the coma are not well understood. We propose to obtain spectrally and spatially-resolved sub-mm emission maps of these molecules in the coma of comet C/2012 K1 (PanSTARRS), which will reach peak activity around perihelion in August 2014. The proposed 3D maps, including multiple spectral lines from CH3OH and the other species of interest, are required in order to determine the excitation, and therefore the precise distributions, of molecules in the coma. These measurements will provide quantitative tests of release models for the species of interest and will be vital in assisting the interpretation of our ALMA data on comets ISON and Lemmon (obtained in 2013).',\n"," 'Molecular gas distribution and dynamics in main-sequence galaxies at the peak epoch of the cosmic star formation. Sensitive measurements of the CO emission line in high-z galaxies at sub-galactic scales are now possible with ALMA. We propose to build a comprehensive sample of z~2.2 star-forming main-sequence galaxies observed in CO(3-2) emission. Making use of the ALMA archive and literature, we have gathered bright unresolved CO(3-2) detections for five galaxies to perform follow-up observations and resolve the galactic disks at 3-5 kpc-scale. We will characterize the gas distribution and dynamics of the likely dominant component in term of mass in those main-sequence galaxies. We will measure and compare the molecular gas extension and rotation velocities with the average values previously measured from the large Halpha IFU surveys. Hence, we will provide clues about how galaxies build-up their stellar mas content at the ``cosmic noon.',\n"," 'The chemical origin of CO in diffuse molecular gas. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium is driven by the combined influence of UV radiation and turbulence. This proposal aims at establishing the CO formation route in the diffuse interstellar gas where much of the CO is formed. In diffuse gas HCO+ is the precursor of CO but its origin is still discussed with different routes in UV-driven and in turbulence-driven chemistries. The key for the origin of CO and HCO+ is CO+ that is required exclusively in the UV-driven chemistry and has been previously detected in the ISM only at the outer edges of dense PDRs. Establishing accurately its abundance will close the loop in the CO chemistry. We have selected the two strongest QSOs with deep HCO+ absorption to search for CO+ absorption at 236 GHz. The experiment is set to use the maximum dynamical range to detect CO+ at the level of a few percent of HCO+, much below its predicted abundance if the UV-driven chemistry is the chemical origin of CO. Within a rather short integration, ALMA will allow to pin down the still controversial origin of CO in diffuse molecular gas.',\n"," 'Completing the Picture of Titans Time-Variable Atmospheric Chemistry on Cassinis Last Flyby. Titans atmosphere is host to a complex organic chemistry and high-altitude circulation system with strong seasonal variability. During the last two years, a dramatic decrease in the abundances of short-lived trace gases (such as HC3N) has been observed over Titans north pole by the Cassini CIRS infrared spectrometer. The speed of this seasonal change has only become apparent in the latest observations (after the Cycle 4 deadline). Such rapid chemical variations provide a unique opportunity to observe the complex interplay between atmospheric chemistry and dynamics in a carbon-rich (reducing) atmosphere, which may be used as a template for other primitive planetary atmospheres, including exoplanets. We propose to measure these atmospheric phenomena using a combination of contemporaneous, spatially-resolved observations with ALMA and Cassini. Combined with CIRS hydrocarbon observations, ALMA observations of HCN, HNC, HC3N, CH3CN, C2H3CN and C2H5CN (plus CO) will probe the atmospheric chemical loss and diffusion rates, to test theories for the production of Titans complex organics and haze. Our proposed DDT observations will be timed to coincide with the May 2017 Cassini flyby.',\n"," 'Molecular gas content of novel isolated star forming clumps. We request 9.9h of 12m array and 59.4h of 7m array time to perform the first ever CO observations of a recently identified class of peculiar blue stellar systems, known as \"blue blobs.\" To date only five blue blobs are known, all in the Virgo galaxy cluster. These young and metal-rich systems contain very few stars (M* < 10^5 Msol) and are remarkably isolated, like tiny blue oases in the enormous red desert of the cluster. They likely formed from stripped gas, but must have traversed up to 100s of kpc through the hot intra-cluster medium while retaining enough molecular gas to form stars, and are likely the first examples of star formation in isolated cloudlets supported by external pressure. Existing observations of all five targets with HST, MUSE/VLT, and the VLA have revealed their unusual stellar populations, metallicities, and atomic gas content. ALMA CO(2-1) observations will complete the picture by providing spatially and kinematically resolved maps of molecular gas, allowing us to address key questions about the nature and fate of these novel objects, which in turn will have implications for our understanding of ram pressure stripping in galaxy clusters.',\n"," 'Mapping mass outflows in an EXor Ourburst. We have discovered a molecular outflow around the prototype EXor outburst source EX Lup. ALMA 12m array data at 0.3\" resolution detect the edges of a wind-swept cavity and ambient-velocity gas from an envelope. The environment of EX Lup is more complex than previously realized, and shows features in common with the related, higher-amplitude, FUor type of eruptive young stellar objects. Those observations were limited to structure on scales < 3.2\" (500 au), and thus limit attempts to explore the intermediate/large-scale gas structures discovered around EX Lup. We propose to use the 12m+ACA+TP arrays to map the environment around EX Lup on 0.3\"-45\" scales (50-7000 au) in order to measure the structure, mass, and kinematics of the outflow and the remnant diffuse gas. This will allow us to correlate outflow and accretion processes in a system having a recent outburst (~10 years ago), shed light on the relationship between FUors and EXors, and will be a pathfinder for investigations in other EXors. Ultimately, this will lead to a better understanding of the interplay of late-stage accretion and outflow processes in driving the evolution of planet-forming disks in low mass stars.',\n"," 'Mapping the 3D Kinematic Structure of Planet Formation. Substructures observed in both the NIR and mm continuum such as gaps, rings and spirals are highly suggestive of on-going planet-disk interactions. Although other mechanisms have been proposed to create these structures without the need for a planet, in the case of HD 163296 observations of the gas kinematics provide extremely strong evidence that (at least) three planetary companions are present (Pinte et al. 2018, Teague 2018, submitted). Using a recently developed technique to measure the 3D velocity structure from line emission, we have identified the characterisic flow structures associated with planet opened gaps, allowing for the transport of volatile rich gas to the planet forming midplane. We propose for high spatial resolution observations of the J=2-1 transitions of 13CO and C18O to, in concert with previously published 12CO observations, map the 3D gas velocity structure as a function of both radius and height in the disk. These maps will, for the first time, allow us to track the delivery of volatiles from the warm molecular layer towards the planet forming region, and provide a direct comparison for simulations of planet-disk interactions.',\n"," 'Mapping CO Emission in eta Carinae During Periastron Passage with ALMA. In Cycle 6 we were awarded Directors time to observe 12CO and 13CO 2-1, 12CO 1-0, and H30-alpha in the Homunculus nebula of the LBV eta Carinae, just before the central massive binary enters periastron. This occurs every 5.54 years, and is accompanied by a sharp reduction of the ionizing radiation field as the hotter companion is enveloped in the dense wind of the more massive primary star. Our goal is to provide a detailed physical description of the shielding structures associated the kinematic components of CO during the ionization high state, complemented by parallel space and ground-based observations. In Cycle 7 we propose to re-observe low-J CO while the X-ray/UV light curve is at minimum in early 2020, and again ~3 months later during recovery to maximum fluences, following the time evolution of the plasma with the onset of disturbances in the X-ray and UV radiation field. This is a rare opportunity to explore gas that reflects CNO-process abundances in a UV-dominated molecular chemistry, and elucidate on the CO formation pathway, rewarding us also with insight into eta Cars role in a broader paradigm for pre-SN LBV activity related to stellar mergers.',\n"," 'Detailed Gas Kinematics and Morphologies of the Highest-redshift Jellyfish Galaxy Candidates at z=1.6. Jellyfish galaxies with long tentacles of gas and stars, formed due to ram pressure stripping, have offered a new regime in which to study quenching and star formation at low-z. The most distant tail candidate has now been unveiled at z=1.6, enabled by ALMA imaging of molecular gas. This galaxy has an asymmetric gas morphology, an offset stellar-to-gas centroid, and an accelerated velocity gradient along the tail-all signposts of ram-pressure stripping. Moreover, a study of 24 CO-detected cluster galaxies has revealed truncated gas disks compared to stellar disks, indicative of quenching. Here, we propose deeper and higher spectral resolution CO(2-1) imaging of 8 of these gas-rich z=1.6 cluster galaxies, all within the same primary beam, and including the first high-z jellyfish candidate. Through a comparison of molecular gas (ALMA CO), stellar mass (optical HST), and star formation (UV HST), we will place important constraints on cluster quenching efficiencies at z=1.6. Furthermore, we will kinematically and morphologically confirm the highest-z ram-pressure stripped galaxy through gas dynamics and spatially correlated star formation enhancement with molecular gas compression.',\n"," 'Filaments and Massive Star Formation. The filamentary nature of the interstellar medium and molecular clouds sparks many questions about the mass assembly of molecular clumps and the formation of dense cores within them. We investigate a nearby, cold, and massive (1300 Msun) clump embedded in the infrared dark cloud G350 in the NGC 6334 star-forming complex. The molecular line emission from NH2D and H13CO+ as well as 3mm continuum traces gas at different evolutionary stages and at a range of densities. The sensitive ALMA observations will probe the mass accretion and fragmentation of molecular clumps and dense core formation. The data from this study will inform development of theoretical models of massive star formation.',\n"," 'How do massive star forming galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation shut down?. Throughout cosmic time, the bulk of field star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which form a fairly tight sequence in stellar mass versus star formation rate (hereafter, \"main-sequence\"),grow by gas accretion/minor mergers and in-situ star formation until their stellar mass exceeds the Schechter mass, logMS*~11, at which point they rapidly shut down and join the red sequence. Why is this so? We propose to measure CO-based molecular gas fractions and gas depletion time scales of a statistically significant sample of massive (M*≥MS) z~2 SFGs that are below the main sequence and thus should be in the process of transitioning to the red sequence. The proposed observations, along with our other data of SFGs at z~1-2 above and on the main sequence, will test for two main proposed INTERNAL quenching mechanisms. Rapidly dropping gas fractions below the main sequence would favor AGN feedback driving the shutdown. Rapidly increasing depletion time scales would favor morphological quenching, where the buildup of a massive bulge/spheroidal component acts to stabilize the galaxies against global gravitational instabilities,as a key player.',\n"," 'Spatial Distribution of physical and chemical properties for dense clumps at different evolutionary stages in supergiant HII region NGC604. We propose to obtain high-resolution 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0), CS(2-1), CH3OH and 12CO(3-2) maps of the supergiant HII region (GHR) NGC604 in M33 to study the physical and chemical properties of molecular gas at different evolutionary stages in the giant HII region. They are tracers of total gas, dense clump, and moderately dense clump, respectively. GHRs can be \"mini-starburst\" and provide us with an ideal environment to understand the clustered OB star formation. Our previous studies (~ a few 10-100 pc) suggest that giant molecular cloud complex of the NGC604 is a unique laboratory for the different, especially, early and intermediate stages along star formation. The next questions are their internal structure - dense molecular gas in a few pc, \"clump\". Our requested spatial and velocity resolutions (1.\"3 or 5 pc and 0.7 km/s), and sensitivity (0.2 K at 100 GHz) can detect a typical clumps, i.e., 1000 Mo. We can simultaneously detect massive dust clump with mass of 250Mo by 0.85mm continuum emission and several O9 stars by 3mm continuum emission. The primary goal of this proposal is to obtain a clump-scale view of dense molecular medium in the NGC 604 complex.',\n"," 'Signature of a Planet in the Gyr-old Eccentric Debris Ring of HD 202628. Opportunities to investigate the diversity of mature analogs to our own Solar System are rare. Therefore, we propose ALMA continuum mapping in band 6 to observe the sub-mm excess from the Gyr-old debris ring surrounding the Sun-like star HD 202628. As revealed in scattered light by HST, HD 202628 is surrounded by a large and eccentric debris disk, as confirmed by Herschel/PACS low resolution images, showing a \"pericenter-glow\" at the inferred position angle of periastron. The debris ring also possesses a sharp inner egde, and its properties are strikingly similar to the Fomalhaut debris ring. This likewise suggests ring sculpting by a distant eccentric planetary companion. ALMA observations will constrain the detailed architecture of this debris disk and map the distribution of the large parent dust grains with respect to the scattered light. In conjunction with the HST and Herschel data, the ALMA results will be used to build a comprehensive model of the ring dust population. They will provide a key dynamical constraint on the properties of the ring perturber, the most distant one ever inferred around a solar-type star.',\n"," 'Unveiling the early phases in the evolution of compact and massive galaxies at the cosmic noon. Using the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan survey an unique and puzzling sample of star-forming galaxies with extremely large luminosities in the UV and Lya (up to MUV=-24.6, log(Lya,erg/s)=44.0) has been recently discovered. From deep rest-frame UV and optical spectra and SED, these sources appear to be dominated by very intense bursts of star-formation (up to 700 Msun/yr) with very young (<10Myr), compact (~1kpc) and almost un-obscured (UV slopes of -1.7 to -2.5) stellar populations, without any evidence so far for AGN activity. We request ALMA observations for eight of the most luminous and vigorous star-forming galaxies in our sample to 1) constrain the presence of dust emission and the mechanisms of dust formation in the early phases of vigorous starbursts, and 2) probe the molecular gas mass and depletion times. These galaxies might represent an early phase in the evolution of massive galaxies, such as quiescent galaxies and/or (sub)millimeter selected galaxies detected at high redshift. They could represent a new class of extremely UV and Lya bright star-forming galaxies in the distant Universe that have been missed in previous surveys.',\n"," 'Building the first statistical sample of powerful radio galaxies within the Epoch of Reionisation. The rapid early growth of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a major astrophysical puzzle. Powerful radio galaxies have long been beacons of active SMBHs. However, unlike luminous optical QSOs, radio-luminous active galactic nuclei are still undetected within the Epoch of Reionisation at z > 6.5. A pilot study outlined a new method for finding ultra-distant radio galaxies using low-frequency radio spectral curvature properties. From only four sources, a powerful radio galaxy was discovered at z = 5.55 via the ALMA Band-3 detection of two CO emission lines; this is the second-most distant radio galaxy currently known. A subsequent study built upon this successful pilot and presented a much larger sample of 51 new ultra-distant radio galaxy candidates selected from the MWA GLEAM survey. Follow-up deep near-infrared VLT K-band observations indicate that 14 of these 51 sources have K > 23 (AB) and hence are excellent candidates for being at very high redshift, potentially at z > 6.5. We propose ALMA Band-3 observations of these targets to determine spectroscopic redshifts, conduct broadband radio spectral modelling and characterise the molecular gas properties.',\n"," 'A detailed view of the Birds anatomy: SF/AGN feedback. The Bird is a luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), logL_IR(L_sun)=11.89, product of a triple merger. The ongoing star formation (SF) in the least massive of the components (the head) outshines that of the primary nuclei (the heart and the body) as evidenced by our Spitzer-24um imaging, hence dominating the LIRG phenomenon in the Bird. This clashes with the commonly accepted major merger scenario in which the SF is expected to be higher in central compact regions. Based on our recent ALMA cycle 2 CO 1-0 observations, we infer the presence of a (in/out)flow from one of the main nuclei. This could be a factor contributing to the apparent SF starvation. In this cycle 3 proposal we aim at investigating the SF/obscured-AGN feedback in the Bird, and how this influences the ISM of this striking object.',\n"," 'The impact of accreting black-holes on the star-forming ISM. A current challenge in the study of the ISM at high redshift is the lack of reliable molecular gas tracers. Studies based on CO rely on the observations of excited states (CO, J>5), which are difficult to interpret due to our poor understanding of the CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) in the early Universe - particularly at high excitation CO states, and for galaxies hosting AGN. We propose to complete our Cycle 7 program, and build a library of CO SLEDS (38 transitions for all of them, exploring a parameter space in excitation not covered to-date. We will link the impact of AGN on the properties of the ISM (excitation, temperature and density), test theoretical models for star forming galaxies, and calibrate CO line ratios at high-z.',\n"," 'Unveiling the Mpc-scale structure of a maturing protocluster at z=3.61. We propose ALMA CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) observations in a protocluster field at z=3.61. This protocluster hosts a compact core that has a significantly high density of galaxies and a massive member in quenching, suggesting the structure is in maturing phase. Recently, five galaxies in this structure have been spectroscopically confirmed at z=3.5-3.61 by NOEMA CO(4-3) detections, unveiling its protocluster nature. Remarkably, a Mpc-scale structure was found around the protocluster core, as evidenced by an overdensity of submillimeter galaxies and ~100 candidate members with consistent photo-z. These strongly suggest this is a Mpc-scale protocluster at z=3.61 with a likely collapsed core. With the proposed observations we will (1) unambiguously reveal the large-scale structure by targeting 10 SMGs in a 3x3 Mpc^2 area, (2) derive molecular gas mass and SFEs via [CI](1-0) and identify if the most massive member is in quenching. The observations will also resolve the compact core, and allow us to (3) assess the dynamical state of the protocluster core by measuring the phase-space distribution and velocity dispersion.',\n"," 'The most distant dusty starburst: 13 Gyr or bust. Only a handful of SMGs are known at z>4, most of them lensed. Using ALMA we set out to measure the redshifts of a unique sample selected from our wide Herschel imaging. The galaxies were selected on the basis of their faintness (ergo they are largely unlensed) and extreme redness (ergo they are rare and very distant). Their properties have been further constrained through SCUBA2 and LABOCA imaging, making it a remarkably robust sample, all with z>4. Recent ALMA 3-mm spectral scans have determined CO redshifts for 3 of 4 targets; for our final target - our reddest, nicknamed \"Great Red Hope\" - we see weak emission lines corresponding to 12CO(7-6) and CI(2-1). These suggest that this is the most distant dusty starburst known. With no plausible lens and L(bol) ~ 10^14 L(sun), this object poses a genuine problem for accepted models of galaxy and structure formation. Confirming that such an extreme starburst has formed only 740 Myr after the Big Bang is of profound and urgent interest. Here, we propose to confirm its redshift unambiguously via deeper observations of 12CO(7-6) and CI(2-1), as well as 12CO(6-5), which requires a total of 2 hr.',\n"," 'Dissecting the Main Sequence of Star Formation with [CI](1-0) Observations. Atomic carbon [CI] has been put forward as an excellent tracer of the ISM conditions and the gas mass reservoir (Mgas) of star forming galaxies (SFGs). However its potential has not been fully exploited as [CI] detections have predominalty been restricted to inhomegenious samples of local and high-z stabursting systems (SBs). We propose CI[1-0] observations for a well characterised sample 30 of SFGs at z~0.6 that lie along and above the main sequence of star-formation (MS), have excellent photometric coverage and robust spectroscopic redshifts. The proposed observations will extend for the first time the L(IR)-L(CI) relation to parameter space that is currenlty devoid of [CI] detections of normal SFGs. From these [CI] detections we will 1) further explore recent evidence (from our Cycle 4 [CI] survey of z~1.2 SFGs) of larger L(CI)/L(IR) ratios between normal SFGs and SBs 2) derive Mgas estimates independent of the conventional CO and dust based methods and most importanlty 3) tackle the still open debate of increased gas fractions vs increased star formation efficiencies between MS and SBs as the main driver of the enhanced star formation in the latter.',\n"," 'Using ALMA to look into galaxy cluster cool cores at high-z. We propose to demonstrate that high-resolution Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect imaging with ALMA can provide a major step forward towards measuring the core temperatures of high-redshift (z > 1) clusters. Together with short-baseline SZ data from the ACA, and Chandra X-ray surface brightness images with moderate (< 100 ks) exposure, the temperature profile of even high-z clusters can be efficiently modeled down to their central ~ 50 kpc radius, thereby overcoming a major observational bottleneck in galaxy cluster research. To demonstrate this, we propose ALMA + ACA observation of the z=1.39 massive galaxy cluster XMMU J2235.3--2257 at 100 GHz. By combining with the existing Chandra X-ray imaging data, we shall be able to reconstruct the radial temperature profile for this well-studied system for the first time, putting precise constraints on its core temperature and entropy. This will be the highest redshift cluster to-date with a temperature profile measurement, and only the second such result for a z > ~1 cluster. We expect that joint SZ/X-ray modeling with ALMA will open up an efficient window for understanding the assembly history of baryons in clusters at high redshifts.',\n"," 'Hot water in the inner envelope of massive proto-stars/clusters. Water controls the chemistry of many other molecular species. It is a unique diagnostic of warm gas and energetic processes taking place during star formation. Observations of water was one of the key science themes of the Herschel space mission. However within the 10-40 arcsec FWHM of Herschel, the water emission regions remain unresolved. Fortunately, some high-excitation lines of water and its rare 18O isotopologue can be observed from the exceptional ALMA high site. In particular, it will be possible to spatially resolve the hot inner envelope of massive proto-clusters in which water is evaporated from the ice mantles of dust grains. In these regions water might rival CO in abundance and, acting as a natural filter for hot gas and with its many lines of high excitation, will provide a new tool to study the inner workings of massive star forming regions, in particular their water abundances, excitation, velocity structure and morphology (disk vs. envelope components), thereby crucially enhancing the value of the water observations we obtained with Herschel/HIFI with high resolution ALMA images of optically thin and high excitation lines.',\n"," 'WALLABY-CO survey of the Hydra cluster: a better understanding of environmental effects on cluster galaxies. Environmental processes play a key role in changing physical properties of cluster galaxy populations. The degree of environmental effects on galaxies could be different in various clusters, depending on the physical properties of clusters (dynamical states, masses). Consequently, it is expected that the properties of molecular gas and star formation history vary from cluster to cluster. Thus, several systematic CO observations for nearby clusters are required to study the environmental dependency of the molecular gas and star formation properties. Using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA), we propose to obtain 12CO (2-1) images of 15 WALLABY galaxies in the Hydra cluster. Being the most massive/relaxed cluster within 50 Mpc, the Hydra is an irreplaceable/necessary laboratory to resolve the environmental effects on galaxies and quantify differences from the extensively studied, but less relaxed Virgo and less massive Fornax. Combining our ACA CO data with multi-wavelength data, we will study environmental effects on the cold ISM components and star formation activity in a resolved view, and most importantly, quantify cluster to cluster differences by comparing with Virgo and Fornax.',\n"," 'The Demographics of Molecular Gas in Dwarf Galaxies with AGN. A comprehensive understanding of the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies requires a close examination of the molecular gas content, which is the fundamental fuel for not only star formation but also Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. Meanwhile, AGN feedback may also directly impact the molecular gas content in the galaxy. While current studies have carefully mapped the molecular gas content in the massive host galaxies of luminous AGN, little is known for dwarf galaxies with AGN. In addition, tantalizing evidence of AGN feedback in dwarf galaxies is also rapidly emerging. To shed light on these issues, we propose to systematically examine the molecular gas content of nearby dwarf galaxies with AGN by searching for CO(1-0) emission in them. We will explore the connection between the AGN properties and molecular gas properties, investigate whether the molecular gas properties of the dwarf galaxies with AGN are systematically different from those without AGN, and search for molecular gas outflows. This information will allow us to evaluate how the feeding of AGN may depend on the molecular gas supply, and how the AGN feedback may impact it.',\n"," 'A dense molecular gas survey at high redshift. The properties of the dense molecular gas (which traces the places where star formation takes place) have been largely studied in the local Universe. However, only a few studies have aimed at understanding the dense molecular gas at high redshift, most of them based on AGNs and QSOs. Building up on the results from a previous ALMA pilot project (Oteo et al. 2017), we here propose to carry out a dense molecular gas survey by targeting the J=4-3 HCN, HCO+ and HNC transitions in a statistically-significant sample of 17 star-forming-dominated, lensed (U)LIRGs at 1.3 < z < 3.3 selected from the H-ATLAS survey. This is the full sample of lensed high-redshift SMGs from H-ATLAS that can be observed in the same J->J-1 transitions, and arguably the best sample to do the proposed studies (unlensed high-z samples would require very long integration times). Combined with previous data (including CO, [CI], [CII] and water transitions), the proposed observations will allow us to carry out the first systematic study of the dense molecular gas and the properties of star formation at high redshift.',\n"," 'Planet Formation and Survival in Newly-Forming Binary Systems. The majority of Sun-like stars form with binary companions, and their dynamical impact profoundly sculpts the formation and survival of their planetary systems; most planets dont survive, but a substantial minority do. Understanding binary assembly and predicting planet survival requires directly connecting the properties of binary systems to the evolution of their planet-forming disks. We propose to use ALMA for 15.81 hours in Band 6 to characterize our unique sample of 8 young disk-hosting binaries that have well-determined binary orbits. We will use the most extended configurations (C8-10) to spatially resolve the circum-primary, -secondary, and -binary disks, testing: 1) where the disks are located in binary systems, 2) alignment of inclination/rotation among disks with the binary orbit and stellar spin, 3) whether binaries imprint signatures of dynamical interactions (gaps and spirals), and 4) the mass budget available for assembling planets in binaries. In summary, our program will connect protoplanetary disk evolution to the features of binary orbits, distinguish binary formation models, and demonstrate which binary properties drive the survival/destruction of planets.',\n"," 'Which way does it go? Molecular gas in multi-spin stellar counterrotator galaxies. We propose observations of CO in four nearby early-type galaxies that each contain two counterrotating stellar disks. These \"stellar counterrotator\" galaxies are unusual but not extremely rare, making up about 4% of local early-type galaxies. But its not clear how they formed. We already have detailed stellar and ionized gas kinematics in the inner few kpc of our targets, along with stellar populations and star formation histories. As molecular gas is the raw material from which stellar disks must grow, CO kinematics will help to distinguish between two basic types of formation scenarios for these unusual galaxies: via gas accretion or via major merger. Thus, these observations will pin down the (possibly different) formation mechanisms for all of the known gas-rich or dusty stellar counterrotators from the Atlas3D survey. As Atlas3D is a complete volume-limited survey, this will allow us to make quantitative comparisons to the formation rates predicted by late gas accretion and correctly-orientated major mergers in modern cosmological simulations.',\n"," 'Constraining the dust properties and radiation field in a lensed z=8.38 galaxy. Understanding the origin and evolution in the dust content of early galaxies represents a fundamental quest for which ALMA is supremely well-suited. In Cycle 3, we spectroscopically-confirmed a z=8.38 lensed galaxy selected in the HST Frontier Fields survey, detecting its dust continuum and [OIII]88mu emission in Band 7. This allowed us to place the first constraints on the dust mass and earlier chemical enrichment history for a galaxy that is possibly only 200 Myr old. However, the significant dust mass appears at variance with limits obtained for other high redshift galaxies. In addition to pending measurements of [C II]158mu emission in Band 5, we propose to target the diagnostic line of [NII]122 mu to determine the nature of the radiation field in this galaxy. The proposed observations will also provide a third measurement of the dust continuum spectrum, significantly improving diagnostic measurements of this unique early source.',\n"," 'SN1987A: an evolving treasure trove of physics. SN 1987A provides an exceptional opportunity to observe the creation of a supernova remnant. ALMA provides unique information by probing both the cold molecular gas in the core of the ejecta through the emission of CO and SiO, and the synchrotron emission arising from the shocks and possibly a plerion. The high spatial and spectral resolution of ALMA provide a spectacular 3D view into the structures that were frozen into the ejecta at the time of the explosion. Therefore ALMA provides us with observations that directly test the energetics of the explosion, progenitor structure, and macroscopic mixing. We propose to follow up our cycle 3 observations to observe the evolution of the ejecta as the X-rays from the reverse shock propagate into the supernova. Over the 1000 day interval since our previous observations, ALMA can resolve the expansion of the ejecta at >2000km/s. Over the same time inverval the X-ray penetration of the ejecta has increased significantly, and the radioactive 44Ti heating has decreased. We shall also observe the ongoing destruction of the ring and seek evidence for a compact remnant.',\n"," 'Resolving CO and Dust Emission in the Phoenix Cluster - The First Bonafide Cooling Flow?. Early observations of galaxy clusters predicted that the hot intracluster medium should cool at rates of 100-1000 Msun/yr, fueling extreme starbursts in the clusters cores. This phenomenon went unobserved for decades. Recently the Phoenix cluster was discovered at z=0.597, harboring an 800 Msun/yr starburst at its center - the highest star-formation rate ever observed in a central cluster galaxy by a factor of 5. Here, we propose to obtain data at redshifted CO(3-2) with 0.7\" resolution in order to determine: i) the morphology of the cold molecular gas; ii) the kinematics of the cold gas, searching for evidence of outflow/disruption; and iii) the IR-derived star formation rate, free from AGN contamination. The kpc-scale distribution of the cold gas and dust can only be studied with the superior resolution and sensitivity of ALMA. This program compliments recently-approved programs with HST, Chandra, and Gemini, allowing us to track the hot ICM as it cools over 7 decades in temperature, ultimately into fuel for star formation, and shedding new light on this uniquely extreme system in which cooling appears to be briefly dominating over feedback.',\n"," 'Sulfur chemistry in the transition zone of low-mass protoplanetary systems. Tracing the chemical evolution during the forming processes of Sun-like stars and planetary systems is crucial for understanding the origin of the Solar system. Our previous observations towards two protoplanetary systems (a Class 0 and a Class I) show significant chemical differentiation in their transition zones, i.e., the CS line traces the infalling-rotating envelope (200 AU), while the shock-enhanced SO line traces the centrifugal barrier (100 AU). Therefore, both sources are ideal laboratories to investigate the time-dependent sulfur chemistry. We propose to observe Band 5 lines of H2S, H2CS, SO2 and CCS towards both sources at a linear resolution of 70 AU. Incorporating our previous ALMA data and our well-developed gas-grain model, these observations will allow us to (1) image the sulfur grain reservoir H2S for the first time towards low-mass protoplanetary systems; (2) investigate the origin of the SO near the centrifugal barrier; (3) construct the gas temperature profile of each source from the ~1000 AU protostellar envelope down to the 70 AU transition zone; (4) draw a clear picture of the sulfur chemistry towards the transition zone in an evolutionary context.',\n"," 'Core mass function and formation mechanism of very low-mass stars. In order to understand the formation mechanism of very low-mass stars and the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we aim at deriving core mass function (CMF) fully sampled from the most nearby (130 pc) cluster forming cloud of Corona Australis employing the large-field mosaic observation with the ACA standalone mode in band 6. The survey is to be conducted in the dust continuum emission together with the dense gas tracer of N2D+ (3-2) line. The outcome CMF will be compared with the stellar IMF obtained by our deep near-IR observation that revealed large number of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects. In case that the resultant CMF resembles the IMF below 0.1 Mo, it supports the formation mechanism of collapsing low-mass dense cores, as a scale-down version of the formation of sun-like stars. The target CrA cloud has been surveyed be Herschel and the dust CMF is already obtained. The dust core detection below 0.1 Mo is still incomplete even with the Herschels high sensitivity. The proposed ACA observations will reinforce the robust core detection with higher spatial resolution, the high critical density, and velocity information of the line.',\n"," 'Demonstrating ALMAs Capabilities with the Luminous Giant Starburst Himiko. We propose Band 6 observations of the giant starburst galaxy Himiko at z=6.595 discovered by our panoramic Subaru survey in the UDS field. This remarkable object, free from strong AGN activity, is unique in its high star-formation rate (100Mo/yr), large stellar mass (2x10^10Mo), and luminous Lyman alpha nebula which extends over 17 kpc. Most likely Himiko is being seen at a special time in its history and thus it provides a natural laboratory for studying the physical processes that govern the assembly of massive galaxies. Our recent HST observations reveal a complex morphology with 3 stellar knots suggestive of a major merger. However, the origin of the extensive ionized nebula is unclear: it could be produced by an energetic superwind or via cold gas accretion along filamentary structures. Our Cycle 1 ALMA observations will considerably extend any data we receive from our approved Cycle 0 program. Specifically, with the spatial resolution same as our HST data (0\".2), they will resolve the structure in this remarkable object revealing the dynamics of each knot using the [CII] 158um line and defining the amount of obscured star formation through a 1.2mm continuum image. The combination will address the origin of Himikos intense luminosity and the power source for the large surrounding nebula. In conjunction with the large set of ancillary data following our original discovery of this system, our proposed observations will showcase the capabilities of the early ALMA array via the first view of how the most massive galaxies formed close to redshift frontier of z~7.',\n"," 'Investigating the sunspot umbra and its millimeter brightening. Sunspots are the best-known and most prominent features on the solar surface. However, they are surprisingly poorly understood, with many models of sunspot atmospheric structure that diverge strongly in the chromosphere. An important reason for this divergence is that the atomic spectral lines on which the models are based generally sample only the hotter part of the gas. ALMA will close this gap in our knowledge, since it provides diagnostics of both, the hot and cool gas in the sunspot chromospheres, with a sufficiently high spatial resolution to resolve and study the internal structure of sunspots. We propose to observe a sunspot umbra and its time variation in ALMA bands 3 and 6 to explain umbral millimeter brightening, the marked increase in 3mm brightness temperature, which we discovered in the ALMA SV data. A time sequence of ALMA images in the two bands will allow diagnosing the umbral thermal structure over a range of heights in the chromosphere. This will enable us to identify the most appropriate sunspot models, and to distinguish if the millimeter umbral brightening is due to shocked downflowing gas (coronal plumes), or to non-linear oscillations (umbral flashes).',\n"," 'Mapping the complex interplay between massive star clusters and their local ISM in a low-metallicity galaxy. We propose 12CO(1-0) and 12C(2-1) observations to map at 42pc (0.5\") resolution the existing molecular CO gas in the central 5\"-10\" (425-850pc) of the blue compact dwarf galaxy Mrk996. This data will be used to investigate the extreme ISM physical conditions driven by the feedback effects of a young, nuclear super star cluster. These properties, namely complex gas kinematics and turbulence, very high density and extinction inhomogeneities, high ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicity of only 20% solar, make this target a unique laboratory to perform a comprehensive study including cold and warm phases of the ISM in the vecinity of a nuclear SSC. We will combine a wealth of existing X-ray, UV and optical datasets targeting ionized gas with the missing piece: spatially resolved molecular gas over spatial scales of few tens of pc. The proposed ALMA observations will provide a coherent picture of the sub-kpc ISM structure of Mrk996. Such multifrequency study is essential to constrain feedback models in an environment which closely resembles those common at high redshift.',\n"," 'Resolved gas kinematics of highly star-forming protocluster galaxies. We propose a study of the gas kinematics of two highly star-forming protocluster galaxies at z~2.6 to reveal the mechanisms that fuel their star-formation activity, and lead to the build up of their massive stellar and gas reservoirs. The selected targets are situated in an overdense Planck-selected protocluster for which low-resolution sub-mm and CO observations are available, and JWST/NIRCam multi-band imaging observations will be obtained. The available data indicate that these sources have massive and extended reservoirs of gas at low excitation producing more than 1000 Msun/yr. It is also plausible that they are affected by multiplicity or strong gravitational lensing. We request ALMA CO and continuum observations at high spatial resolution of these protocluster galaxies to determine, through a morphological and kinematical analysis of their molecular gas reservoir, the physical mechanisms behind their prodigious star-forming activity. This program will increase the limited number of protocluster galaxies at z~2-3 with known gas kinematics, and hence the possibility of investigating the link between local cluster galaxies and their predecessors at higher redshifts.',\n"," 'CO(3-2) spectroscopy of first GRB detected at TeV energies. This is an urgent DDT to observe GRB 190114C, the first gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected at TeV energies. This event also has one of the densest lines of sight towards a GRB afterglow to date, which makes it ideal for observing molecular absorption. This observation will help us understand the connection between the very dense environment of this GRB and the very high energy emission. The observation will cover the CO(3-2) transition at a redshift of 0.4252. We expect to detect this transition both in absorption and in emission. VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy has revealed that the line of sight is very dense; it has the strongest NaID ever seen for a GRB and for the first time we have detected DIBs in a GRB. Detecting molecular absorptions with ALMA would be a first for GRBs. At the same time we expect to see CO emission from the host galaxy which is more massive than usual GRB hosts. These data will be combined with optical and near infrared afterglow spectroscopy obtained with X-shooter at the VLT, and with an extensive follow-up campaign in radio from another ALMA programme, from ATCA and from GMRT to produce an extensive study of the interstellar medium.',\n"," 'Molecular gas in WISE-selected Hyper-luminous Hot, Dust-obscured Galaxies. A new population of hyper-luminous, dusty obscured galaxies at z~ 2-3 using WISE has been discovered recently. They are hyper-luminous and rare (about 1000 such objects in all sky). They also trace the peak epoch of cosmic star formation and QSO activity. The hot dust temperature and extremely high luminosity indicate that these objects are likely heavily obscured quasars. The detailed SED decomposition found that the emission from cold dust contributes a small part of the total IR luminosity but is still comparable to those found in SMGs, indicating SFRs ~1000 solar mass per year. The physical conditions of molecular gas will be crucial to understand how both starburst and QSO activities have been fueled. The previous attempt to detect CO line failed due to shallow line sensitivity. Here we propose to detect CO J=4-3 line of three such objects with ALMA band 3 in order to 1) check LCO- LIR relation; 2) study the total molecular gas content and galaxy kinematics; 3) search the molecular gas outflow which may be related to extreme starburst and QSOs activity.',\n"," 'Tracing the onset of star formation with ALMA. We propose to observe with ALMA six centrally concentrated, highly evolved starless cores in the cluster-forming Ophiuchus molecular cloud. The selected targets include cores both within and outside of the larger Oph filaments. Despite their highly concentrated single-dish submillimetre features and small-scale structure as probed by interferometric NH3 observations, 70 micron non-detections indicate that any embedded protostars are very low luminosity, with upper limits L_int < 0.1 L_Sun for most of the targets. The proposed observations will reveal the core structure at 0.25\" resolution (30 AU) at 359 GHz continuum, and the core kinematics using the dense gas tracer H2D+, critical to identify rotation and infall in the dense gas. Finally, we will search for slow outflows potentially driven by embedded first hydrostatic cores or extremely young embedded protostars undetected at 70 micron.',\n"," 'The nature of dark matter in galaxy collisions. Like particle physics experiments in terrestrial colliders, astrophysical collisions can be used to probe the nature of dark matter. Gravitational lensing observations with HST revealed a 1.62+/-0.48 kpc offset between the dark matter and stars of one galaxy moving through Abell 3827. Such offsets are not produced in simulations of collisionless CDM, but are consistent with predictions of self-interacting dark matter. Before these measurements can be regarded as definitive evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model, the experiment must be repeated. Abell 3827s proximity and gravitational lensing makes it the ideal target. VLT/MUSE follow-up revealed additional lensed images around more of its galaxies - but difficult foreground subtraction confuses the lensed image, preventing further progress at optical wavelengths. We propose ALMA observations of molecular gas in CO(2-1), where the foregrounds become transparent. By tracing molecular gas in the lensed images (in particular, the central counter-image), we will constrain dark matters self-interaction cross-section to ~0.1cm^2/g. This will inform present excitement between the astronomy and particle physics communities.',\n"," 'Study of the earliest phases of a Super Star Cluster (SSC) formation in the starburst ring of NGC 1068. We have used 0.4\" ALMA images of the HC3N vibrational excited emission (HC3N*) to reveal the first Super Hot Core (SHC) in the starburst ring of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. Associated to Super Star Clusters (SSCs), HC3N* emission is a direct probe of unobscured mid-IR emission since it is radiatively pumped by dust heated by the protostars. The SHC is unresolved, has a temperature ~300 K, a large apparent luminoty few 10^10 Lsun and is likely tracing the earliest phases of a SSC, just before massive stars ionize their surroundings. However, our estimates are still very rough and higher angular resolution and sensitivity are required to make robust estimates of its properties. We propose to image the HC3N* emission in the SHC with a 0.023-0.046\" resolution and enough sensitivity to make accurate measurements of its size, temperature, mass and luminosity, and to derive its temperature and density profile. This data will provide unique information on how SSC form and the effect of the feed back from the AGN on star formation at scales of kpcs.',\n"," 'Resolving Massive Molecular Outflows in a Representative Sample of Local ULIRGs. Galaxy formation scenarios of massive galaxies invoke regulation/quenching of star-formation (SF) due to high-velocity, massive molecular outflows to explain the high-end of the galaxy mass function. These outflows driven by coeval accreting BHs and nuclear starbursts are predicted during the IR-luminous star-forming phase of galaxies at z~1-4. The same mechanisms have been invoked to explain the evolution of low-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), from SF-dominated to naked QSOs. Our Cycle 4 pilot program has characterized, and spatially resolved, extended (1-4 kpc) molecular outflows in 5 out of 6 nuclei in 3 close interacting ULIRGs. We propose to extend this study to a representative sample of 23 ULIRGs (19 new + 4 archive) covering the different nuclear activities, and advanced interaction phases of the ULIRG population. Similar to Cycle 4, the 500pc resolution CO(2-1) data, will provide key outflow geometrical (size, axis) and physical (mass, velocity, and time scale) properties, needed to confirm, or not, the effective removal of the raw material needed for SF and, thus, test the galaxy formation models of massive galaxies in their low-z analogs (ie. ULIRGs).',\n"," 'Comprehensive Study of Molecular Gas in Tidal Dwarf Galaxies. One of the biggest challenges in modern astrophysics is to understand how gas is transformed into stars and how this is influenced by local and global environment. Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDG) form in the debris of galaxy mergers, have higher metallicity than typical dwarfs (inherited from their parent galaxies), and are largely devoid of dark matter. Despite their interest as an extreme dynamical environment, only two published studies have resolved molecular gas in TDGs below kpc scales, and only one of them resolved giant molecular clouds (GMC). In this context, we aim to 1) determine how different and extreme environments affect the ability of molecular gas to form stars, ad 2) analyse the influence of molecular gas organization, particularly the diffuse gas, on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We propose CO(1-0) observations with 12m + ACA + TP in a sample of 6 TDGs, ensuring sensitivity across all spatial scales, from 100-300 pc down to largest angular scales of 70. This pioneering study will allow us to characterize the gas organization in a statistically significant sample of TDGs, laying the foundation for testing star formation theories across cosmic environment.',\n"," 'Probing Black Hole Mass in Seyfert AGN Using Atomic-Carbon Gas. Accurately weighing supermassive black hole mass (SMBH, Mbh) using ALMA high-spatial-resolution observations of circumnuclear gas discs (e.g. low-J CO) at scales from a fraction to a few times of the black holes sphere of influence radius (Rsoi) has been applied for a wide range of galaxy morphologies from early-type (ETGs) to late-type (LTGs). However, its application for Seyfert active galactic nuclei (AGN) was limited to a few ETGs; and has not been explored extensively in LTGs due to the inegligible distributions of low-J-CO outflows or central holes driven by AGN. Recent work in the Seyfert type-1 NGC 7469 revealed the atomic-[CI](1-0) gas excited from the X-ray-dominated region being a better probe of Mbh than CO in AGN because of the dramatic increase in atomic carbon abundance by dissociating CO molecules. To solidify this new Mbh tracer in AGN, it is necessary to test it further on other AGN with higher spatial resolutions. Here, we propose ALMA high-spatial-resolution observations for a sample of 9 local AGN to characterize their atomic-[CI](1-0)-gas contents and kinematics at the spatial scales of a fraction or several times of the SMBHs Rsoi.',\n"," 'Surveying the Seeds of Star Formation: Starless Cores in Aquila. Starless cores represent the initial conditions for the next generation of stars. The degree of substructure in these cores is directly linked to core formation processes and stellar multiplicity. We have conducted ALMA surveys of starless cores in Chamaeleon I (Cycle 1), Ophiuchus (Cycle 2), and Orion B North (Cycle 3). We find evidence for both starless core fragmentation and hidden protostars in the Ophiuchus sample, and have used nondetections in the Chamaeleon I sample to constrain the evolutionary stage of this clouds starless core population. We find that fragmentation is biased toward the most unstable starless cores that are rare in the clouds targeted to date. As such, the statistics on starless core fragmentation remain poor. Here we extend our survey to the Aquila molecular cloud. We target the 100 most unstable starless cores in this cloud with Band 3 continuum and CO observations, increasing our total sample of unstable starless cores by a factor of five. With these data we will fully determine the fraction of cores harboring hidden protostars, the timescales of fragmentation, and the role of turbulent fragmentation in the formation of multiple systems.',\n"," 'Microphysics and astrophysics at play in an assembling massive galaxy at cosmic dawn. Understanding how the first massive black holes and galaxies grew <1 Gyr after the Big Bang is an open question of modern astronomy. The quasar PJ308-21 at z=6.2342 is the poster child of such rapid growth. The central ~1e9 Msun black hole is accreting at its Eddington limit, embedded in a galaxy with a gaseous reservoir of ~1e11 Msun that forms ~200 new stars every year. A companion galaxy is tidally stripped by, and on the verge to merge with the host galaxy of the quasar. This exceptional laboratory of galaxy evolution has been targeted with HST, Chandra, ALMA, VLT, and will soon be studied in detail with JWST. We propose to complete this rich dataset with a sensitive search for [OIII] 88um, [NII] 122um and [NII] 205um. These three lines, together with the [CII] 158um map in hand, and the forthcoming JWST data, will unveil a suite of properties of the ionized ISM: electron density, temperature, pressure, metallicity, hardness and origin of the photoionizing flux, etc. Such a wealth of information on the microphysics of the gas is new for the distant Universe, and will open a new window on our understanding of the astrophysics of galaxy assembly and growth at cosmic dawn.',\n"," 'Measuring the mass distribution with unprecedented accuracy in the CLASH cluster MACSJ1206. Multi-probe analyses are needed to achieve one of the main goals of precise and accurate cosmology: the unbiased cluster mass measurement at the per cent level. The combination of independent observables, from X-ray to lensing to Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, guarantees that the measurement of mass and other intrinsic properties are unbiased and systematic-free. However, despite the growing interest, this topic is still in its infancy. We have started the CLUster Multi-Probes in Three Dimensions (CLUMP-3D) project (Sereno, Ettori et al. 2017) to get the unbiased intrinsic properties of galaxy clusters by exploiting rich datasets ranging from X-ray, to optical, to SZ wavelengths. As a pilot study to address this fundamental science case, we aim at completing the wavelength coverage over different scales of the galaxy cluster MACS~J1206.2-0847, for which the only missing piece in the puzzle is SZ at high angular resolution.',\n"," 'ALMA measurements of disk turbulence. The amount of turbulence in proto-planetary disks controls both the disk evolution and the formation of large solids, which are the seeds for the formations of planets. We propose to image the proto-planetary disk around the young star HD 163296 in the 12CO, 13CO, and C18O J=2-1 transitions to measure the disk turbulent velocity across the entire vertical extent of the disk within the midplane CO snow line. We will study whether the most dense disk regions are quiescent or turbulent, and provide direct constraints to theoretical models for the disk viscosity. The proposed ALMA Cycle 2 observations have the potential to reveal the long-postulated MRI dead-zones which are expected to play a fundamental role in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.',\n"," 'The Molecular Gas and Dust Distribution of the Hot Dust Obscured Galaxy W0410-0913. The WISE mission has recently identified a rare population of high-redshift, hyper-luminous infrared galaxies, all with bolometric luminosities above 10^13 L_Sun, and many exceeding 10^14 L_Sun. Characterized by their extremely red mid-IR colors and very hot dust temperatures, these hot, dust obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) likely probe a key stage in the galaxy evolution paradigm. During cycles 2 and 3 we have carried out observations of the [CII] emission line which confirm these galaxies are in a cathartic stage. One of these Hot DOGs, W0410-0913, shows a very extended dust continuum and the highest [CII] deficit ever measured. We request here deep, high-resolution observations of the CO(6-5) emission line and the nearby dust continuum to study the physical state of its ISM.',\n"," 'Validating the range of D/H ratios in our Solar Systems primitive H2O reservoir. The deuterium-to-hydrogen fraction (D/H) in cometary water ice is a crucial diagnostic for the possible contribution of comets to the Earths water budget, but the average D/H ratio in the comet population is not well constrained due to (1) a lack of sufficiently sensitive ground-based measurements, and (2) a large apparent spread in the values from past observations. We aim to address this issue with the first study of cometary HDO using ACA observations of the very strong 1,1,1 - 0,0,0 line, which is uniquely accessible in ALMA Band 10, allowing the HDO abundance to be measured with unprecedented sensitivity. Our measurements of D/H in comet 67P during its extremely favorable 2021 apparition will provide a \"ground truth\" test of the unexpectedly high D/H value measured in this comet by the Rosetta spacecraft. We will also measure D/H for the first time in the (predicted) bright Oort cloud comet (OCC) C/2021 A1 (Leonard), to obtain the most accurate D/H value ever obtained in an OCC from the ground (or to determine the most stringent upper limit to-date), with the potential to transform our understanding regarding the origins of cometary and terrestrial water.',\n"," 'Exploiting the synergy between early ALMA and VLT/AO-IFU. For several years it has been a challenge to study high-z star-forming galaxies using both optical and sub-millimetre spectroscopy -- a problem mainly induced by typically large dust extinctions in these systems. In this work we propose a pilot extra-galactic experiment to forge a synergy between the ALMA and VLT telescopes. We use a uniquely suited z=1.4608 star-forming galaxy selected from the HiZELS coverage in the UDS field. It is located near a bright star that aided adaptive optics (AO)-assisted integral field unit (IFU) Halpha imaging with SINFONI (0.15~kpc-scale resolution). The IFU imaging revealed large ionised gas complexes in a rotating disk (approximately 50% of the light is in the form of clumps), allowing an estimate of inclination, asymptotic rotation speed and dynamical mass. We propose to use ALMA to follow-up these observations and measure the available reservoir of molecular gas mass via the CO(2-1) emission (in Band-3) and the spatial distribution of the cold dust (in Band-7). ALMA observations at kpc-resolution, matched to the spectral imaging, will provide key insights into the drivers of the star-formation (and its efficiency) at z~1.5, near the peak of the cosmic star-formation activity, where galaxies were assembling most of their stellar mass.',\n"," 'Investigating the role of the magnetic field in high-mass star formaing regime. Even though a consensus on the model at play is still missing in the context of high-mass star formation, it is well established that the magnetic field plays a significant role. Here, we propose to study its impact on 8 massive dense cores (MDCs) of the NGC6334. These MDCs display atypical features with high-mass (~200 Msun) at 0.1 pc scale but only a few low mass proto-stellar cores at ~3000 au scales, while usual efficiency of 30% from cores to stars predicted a few 20 Msun stars in formation in each cores. The model for magnetically regulated core-collapse (e.g. Nakamura & li 2008, Hennebelle et al. 2011) predict such features (low level of fragmentation if a strong magnetic field is present. The magnetic field is also of fist importance to explain the accretion-ejection processes both using the magnetospheric ejection model (Zanni & Ferreira 2013) or using the X-wind model (Shu et al. 1998). In these models the ejection of material forming the outflows occurs along the magnetic field lines. Since all the protostellar objects we propose to study display outflows, our sample is execllent for testing the validity of accretion-ejections models in the high-mass star forming regime.',\n"," 'A Stellar Occultation by Titan: Contemporaneous Sub-mm and Optical Wind Mapping. On September 5th 2022, Saturns moon Titan will be subject to a rare stellar occultation event, during which the center of Titans shadow will pass almost directly over Mauna Kea. This will provide an exceptional opportunity to perform high-cadence photometry of the refracted light around Titans limb, using some of the most powerful optical telescopes on Earth. These refracted light measurements are extremely sensitive to the zonal wind speeds in Titans atmosphere [1]. Previous stellar occultation measurements, however, have shown very different zonal wind speeds as a function of latitude compared with those obtained recently using ALMA Doppler-shift data [5,9]. We propose to take advantage of this unique opportunity to perform contemporaneous (optical) occultation and (sub-mm) Doppler wind-mapping observations to help resolve the cause of this discrepancy and thus improve our understanding of Titans complex global circulation and climate.',\n"," 'The first measurement of a metallicity gradient in a dust-obscured galaxy at z=4. We propose 0.2arcsec(1.3 kpc)-resolution observations of [OIII]88 and [NII]205 lines for one of the best-studied submillimeter bright galaxies (SMGs) at z = 4.34, following our successful high-resolution observations of CO(4-3) and [CII] lines. The target, COSMOS-AzTEC-1, is a very massive, star-forming galaxy and the CO emision is concentrated on the central 1 kpc region, suggesting that AzTEC-1 is the most likely progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at the peak of the cosmic star formation history. If the concentration of molecular gas is caused by an infall of pristine gas into the central 1 kpc region, we would see a deficit of metal-rich gas in the center. If not, metal-poor gas would be accreted onto the surrounding disk, supporting a scenario that the most massive galaxies grow from inside out. The primary goal of this proposal is to measure the gas-phase metallicities in the very bright, compact SMG using [OIII]/[NII] ratio. We will for the first time explore the metallicity gradient in such a heavily dust-obscured galaxy to constrain the scenarios of gaseous processes.',\n"," 'Isotopic constraints on the IMF in the most extreme star-forming environments in the Universe. The small handful of known proto-cluster cores are the most extreme known star-forming environments in the Universe. Their very existence poses a serious challenge for galaxy formation models, in which no such structures are formed. We aim here to solve an intriguing, inter-related puzzle, which has far-reaching consequences. In each proto-cluster core we see a dozen intense yet ephemeral (~100 Myr) dusty starbursts, spanning distances that preclude mutual triggering. Using 13CO/C18O to trace their star formation history, being sensitive to their stellar IMF, and using [CI](1-0) as the most effective tracer of the molecular gas, we will determine whether these uniquely multiplexed starbursts are made possible by a lower rate of star formation, or by having considerably more gas to digest. 13CO/C18O/CI can be observed simultaneously in the two most extreme known proto-cluster cores: DRC and SPT2349-56, both at z=>4. With one deep ALMA observation of each cluster, we will answer our puzzle, providing a crucial benchmark for the cosmological evolution of the IMF.',\n"," 'Large spatial scale interaction of gas phase Si-C molecules and dust grains. Si-C bearing molecules (SiC, Si2C, and SiC2) are related to the dust formation processes in the envelopes of C-rich stars since grains are mainly composed of silicon carbide and also carbonaceous material. These molecules are efficiently formed in gas phase, close to the stellar photosphere as a consequence of different chemical processes. Then, in the dust formation region (5-20R*), they are likely to condense onto grains due to their highly refractory nature. Beyond this region, the abundances of Si-C bearing molecules are expected to decrease until they are eventually re-formed in the outer shells of the circumstellar envelope owing to the interaction between the gas and the interstellar UV field. Motivated by our recent discoveries about Si-C bearing molecules toward IRC+10216, we propose to observe several lines of Si2C, SiC, and SiC2, in order to map the regions where these molecules emit. The proposed observations will allow us to study their radial abundance profiles as well as the chemical processes that form them at intermediate and large spatial scales, as well as the time-dependent chemical evolution of Si-C bonds carriers along the circumstellar envelope of IRC+10216.',\n"," 'Imaging the Debris Disc Around the Planet Host Star HD 95086. Only four systems exist with both detected debris discs and directly imaged planets: Fomalhaut, HR 8799, beta Pic and HD95086. Studies of the first three have led to groundbreaking new discoveries in our understanding of planet-disc interactions, but each system is unique. The last of these is the least well studied of the four since its planet was only discovered and the disc was only resolved in the past year. ALMA presents the perfect opportunity to obtain the first detailed image of this interesting system and find out whether and how the planet and the disc interact. We propose Band 6 observations to acquire detailed imaging of the disc in order to determine its structure and radial distribution. These can in turn reveal evidence of the influence of the planet on the disc. The resolved, high sensitivity data will allow us to detect modulations of the disk surface brightness as small as 20% and on a spatial scale as small as 40 AU (0.89\"). Thus, the observations will not only allow us to constrain the disk properties, but also the architecture of the planetary system.',\n"," 'The Molecular Gas Reservoirs of Epoch of Reionization Galaxies. Molecular gas has never been studied in normal epoch of reionization galaxies (z>~6). This is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how high-z galaxies assembled their mass. Now we can dramatically improve this situation thanks to the newest samples of especially bright z>6 galaxies. In fact, recent advanced simulations of high-z galaxies predict that high-J CO lines should be detectable in several of the brightest known z>6 galaxies with only modest ALMA programs (few hours per source). The CO luminosities of local galaxies, however, are ~x3 fainter than those predicted for high-z galaxies. And they are even fainter in local metal poor galaxies. Here we will provide the first empirical evidence to either validate the theoretical predictions or to place very strong constraints on the CO luminosities that we should expect from normal z>6 galaxies. We have selected a z=6.577 source that should be particularly amenable to detections of CO(7-6) and CO(6-5). If the theoretical predictions are correct, this will be the first z>6 galaxy for which we can study its molecular gas reservoir and it will open the opportunity for a sistematic study of the molecular gas in EoR galaxies.',\n"," 'Molecular gas conditions and shocks in the superwind of the starburst galaxy NGC 1808. We propose multi-line observations of the starburst galaxy NGC 1808 motivated to study the state of the neutral interstellar medium in a prototypical starburst galaxy with a superwind. The study aims to address: 1) the physical conditions of the molecular gas in the starburst region of the galaxy, which is the origin of a polar dust outflow, 2) the energetics (mass and kinetic energy) of the molecular gas in the outflow, and 3) the dense shocked gas to trace the evolution of molecular clouds in the past starburst episode. The methods consist in observations of the molecular lines of CO, HCN, HCO+, SiO, and CS, and modeling the physical conditions with radiative transfer analysis. CO(3-2), HCN, HCO+, and CS reveal the dense molecular gas, and SiO is a reliable tracer of dense shocked gas. NGC 1808 is one of the few nearby starburst galaxies with prominent superwinds - a valuable target to address the wind feedback, while demonstrating the capabilities of ALMA.',\n"," 'Formation of complex organics around protostars in isolated cores. ALMA has since its beginning shown its great potential for astrochemical studies with many interesting discoveries of complex organic, and prebiotic, molecules toward low- and high-mass stars. However, significant questions concerning the formation of these species still remain, for example how important are the physical conditions in the environment of the protostars on the outcome in terms of their chemistry. So-far the complex chemistry has mainly been studied toward sources associated with relatively dense and clustered environments. However, recently ALMA has also revealed the presence of similar complex chemistries toward protostars located in isolated cores. This proposal will address whether the early physical evolution of protostars in such cores reflect in their chemistry. It will systematically measure the abundances of the molecules forming the basis for the first level of complex organic chemistry. These measurements will be interpreted in the context of laboratory experiments and detailed models and provide a new perspective on the link between the birth of individual protostars and the chemistry of their eventual protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'The Hidden Compton Thick Nucleus of the Southern Starburst Galaxy NGC4945. The AGN and starburst galaxy NGC4945 is one of the most prolific molecular lighthouses outside the Local Group. Having published spectacular band 3 results (beamsize 2\") and making use of the spectral versatility and unique spatial resolution and sensitivity of ALMA, here we propose band 3 observations with 0.3\" resolution: (1) to resolve the nuclear core, (2) to study its connection with the nuclear disk farther out, (3) to define its connection with the H2O megamaser disk further inside, (4) to search for a nuclear torus, (5) to resolve the nuclear disk along the minor axis and to refine the nuclear disk model, (6) to search for S-shaped isovelocity contours hinting at an inner bar, (7) to quantify the displacement between the peak of the star formation and the AGN, (8) to reveal first rudimentary information on excitation conditions, and (9) to determine the enclosed mass as a function of radius. A beam of 0.3\" provides the optimal bridge between the previous observations (2\") and the size of the megamaser disk (0.05\") and offers, with the unique linear resolution of 5-6 pc, a direct look into a Compton-thick active nuclear environment.',\n"," 'High redshift star formation at ~500 pc: investigating gas and star formation laws in a main sequence galaxy at z~2. For the first time we will resolve dense star forming gas in an unlensed main sequence galaxy at z>2 at ~500pc. BX610 is a main sequence galaxy which, unlike many galaxies studied at high redshift, is undergoing modest star formation spread throughout the disk, with long gas depletion timescales. It therefore represents an under-studied, but important population in the early universe. We have carried out low resolution observations of CO lines and [CI] to determine bulk molecular and atomic gas properties and we recently used ALMAs exquisite capabilities to observe CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) at 500pc resolution. We propose observing CO(7-6), [CI](2-1), and H2O at matching resolution, as well as continuum near the peak of the infrared dust SED. These observations will reveal warm star forming gas and directly probe the obscured star formation. This will enable unprecedented analysis of the conditions of star forming gas. Paired with our previous high-res data we will measure resolved gas depletion times, test the Kennicutt-Schmidt law in a new environment, characterize gas conditions through resolved LVG and PDR models, and investigate additional heating mechanisms such as shocks.',\n"," 'Investigating CO Emission Associated with the Luminous Blue Variable AG Car. Luminous Blue Variable stars (LBVs) are a highly luminous (~10^6 Lsun), unstable phase in the evolution of massive stars. AG Car is regarded as a prototypical LBV and is one of the best studied objects in its class. Both CO 1-0 and 2-1 have been detected in single dish observations of AG Car. The emission is thought to originate from the circumstellar environment of AG Car, either from a cool extended circumstellar envelope or a disk close to the star. We are requesting high spatial resolution (25 mas) observations of AG Car to determine if the CO emission associated with this object is due to a disk close to the source. Detecting molecular emission from circumstellar disk around AG Car would be first of its kind detection for an LBV. The discovery of a massive disk around this object would indicate that equatorial mass loss due to stellar rotation plays a significant part in the total mass loss of AG car. This result would demonstrate an important difference between fast and slow rotating LBVs.',\n"," 'Inner disk, dust ring and spiral-like structures in the circumstellar disk AB Aurigae. The disk of AB Aurigae exhibits spectacular spiral patterns. However, previous explanations of the spiral formations are purely based on the morphologies due to the lack of the kinematic information. We have started SMA+PdBI+30m observations toward AB Aurigae to trace the kinematics of the spirals using CO lines with 0.4 resolution. We found that spirals traced with CO 2-1 is accreting material from the envelope following the parabolic/spiral-like trajectories well above or below the disk plane. The bases of these spirals are very close to the 1.3 mm dust ring and therefore, the material may accumulate near the edge of the dust ring. How the material accretes further from this ring toward the central disk is another question, more likely related to a tidal truncation by an unknown companion. We propose to observe 12CO, 13CO and C18O 2-1 lines, SO 5(6)-4(5) line and the dense disk using 1.4 mm continuum with 0.1\" resolution. We aim at tracing the bases of the spiral structures and resolve (constrain) the size and dust properties of the inner disk.',\n"," 'Magnetic field study of the disk and outflow of HH30. HH30 is a young T-Tauri star that drives a bipolar jet. In cycle 2 we obtained ALMA data in band 6 at 0.2 resolution to study the disk and the 12CO outflow previously reported by Pety et al. (2006). We managed to weel characterize the disk of HH30, that is in Keplerian rotation, and the monopolar outflow of HH30. The CO outflow has a hollow conical morphology and is rotating in the same direction as the disk at a velocity of ~0.6 km/s. The characteristics of the outflow in terms of mass ejection rate (> 9.10^{-8} Msun/yr) and conservation of angular momentum best favor MHD disk winds models where a large-scale poloidal magnetic field is anchored in the disk (see Feirrera et al. 2006). To test forwards these models, we request full polarisation 12CO, 13CO and continuum observation of the HH30 system. We will test the morphological predictions for the magnetic field of these models (helicoidal morphology in the outflow - poloidal in the inner disk - and most likely toroidal in the outer part of the disk) with observation. We will also address the mono-polarity of the disk with respect to the magnetic field morphology.',\n"," 'HLTau Band 1 continuum: observatory project.

HL Tau shows completely different polarization morphologies in Bands 3, 6, and 7. At Band 3, the morphology is azimuthal, and the polarization has been attributed to grains aligned perpendicular to the radiative anisotropy. At Band 7, the morphology is consistent with self-scattering. Band 6 shows ~50/50 mix between the two morphologies. However both models explaining the polarization patterns have severe problems. While the scattering model has a strong prediction for how the polarization percentage should vary with wavelength and how large the dust grains can be, the predicted slope in the polarization spectrum is not observed, nor do the modeled grain sizes match studies of the dust opacity index. Moreover, the model for grains aligned with the radiation anisotropy predicts a morphology for the polarized intensity that was not seen at 0.36\" resolution in Band 3. If we confirm this missing feature with higher resolution Band 4/5 observations, it would cast serious doubt on this alignment mechanism. We propose polarimetric observations of HL Tau in Band 4 and 5 at 0.2\"/0.16\" resolution, which will allow us to discern how disk polarimetry can be used to constrain grain sizes.',\n"," 'Caught in the act: ALMA witnesses galaxy transformation. Understanding why star formation is shut down galaxies is important for understanding their origins, the quenching mechanism, and how rapidly galaxies build up the red-sequence. The stacked far-infrared fluxes of the first robust sample of z~1 post-starburst galaxies reveal a surprising result - that quenching galaxies still have substaintial dust contents. This finding is at odds with the expectation that these galaxies have run out of gas and will enter the red-sequence in the next few 100 Myr. Using 18 hours of ALMA time we propose a study of the dust and gas properties of 9 massive, ultra-compact z~1 galaxies which are undergoing rapid quenching of their star formation. Our observations will allow us to determine whether these galaxies are devoid of gas. If we find significant gas contents, then these galaxies may rejuvenate, which will require us to revise the popular scenario in which red-sequence galaxies are formed after a single quenching episode. ALMA observations of z~1 galaxies caught in the act of transforming will help confirm or refute the rapid quenching mode of forming red sequence galaxies.',\n"," 'ALMA Observation of a New SiO Maser Source Associated with High-mass Star Formation. Unlike H2O, CH3OH, and OH masers, SiO masers are rarely detected in star-forming regions. There are only 7 confirmed SiO maser sources associated with star formation. We recently detected SiO maser emission at 86GHz toward NGC6334F (d=1.21 kpc), which is a well-known high-mass star-forming region showing H2O maser flaring since 2015 February. We propose to observe NGC6334 in the 86~GHz SiO maser line at 0.4 arcsecond spatial resolution. It is also possible to observe multiple other molecular lines that trace dense cores (H13CO+) and outflows (SiO v=0, HCO+, HCN, CS). The primary goals of this proposal are to pinpoint the positions of the SiO masers and to figure out what objects the masers are physically associated with. We plan to examine the relationship between the SiO masers and the flaring H2O masers. We will be also able to investigate the detailed physical and dynamical properties of dense cores and dense-gas outflows.',\n"," 'The first dusty envelopes and outflows around proto-BDs. The formation of brown dwarfs (BDs) is a hot field of research because there are no clear-cut examples of deeply embedded BDs (or proto-BDs), yielding a missing gap between the stages prior to collapse and the stages where the object is almost formed and deprived of gas and dust. We have selected deeply embedded Spitzer sources in the Taurus region whose infrared magnitudes are consistent with a substellar nature and their colors are typical of Class 0/I protostars. In addition, these Spitzer sources are associated with sub-mm Herschel emisssion, and thermal radiojets like those found in low-mass protostars. ALMA is the only interferometer able to detect the 1-mm continuum and CO (2-1) emission of these faint objects, something crucial to unambiguously characterize their envelope and outflow properties, and compare them to the known stellar properties. This will provide definitive clues to disentangle the different formation scenarios of BDs.',\n"," 'Pattern Speed in the Double-Barred Galaxy: NGC 3504. We propose to establish a new method using molecular gas to study the pattern speed of the inner bar in a double-barred galaxy. The pattern speed is a key property in studies of galactic dynamics, affecting the evolution of a galaxy. However, it is difficult to measure especially for double-barred galaxies, for which the inner and the outer bars are characterized by different pattern speeds. In contrast to using the Halpha line, we choose the CO(2-1) line as a tracer to use the phase reversals method. This is more fundamental since the CO line traces the continuous star forming regions. This is the first time this new method is applied at radio wavelengths for an observation with high angular and velocity resolution. Once this new method has been demonstrated for the CO line, we will apply it to other galaxies. To achieve our goal, we propose to observe the double-barred galaxy NGC 3504, which is nearly face-on and can be resolved by ALMA in a reasonable time. Our high sensitivity and high resolution data of molecular gas will provide essential input for studies of the effects of the bar pattern speed on the kinematics and morphological properties in the inner region of the galaxy.',\n"," 'Dust traps in LkCa 15?. Dust trap by pressure bumps is the most promising scenario to avoid the fast radial migration of dust toward the central star. Observational evidences of dust traps have been found around class II disks, however these signatures have been less studied around transition disk, which are expected to effectively trap dust grains in the rings out of their inner cavity. In this proposal we plan to study the band 3 dust continuum emission of the transition disk around LkCa15 at an angular resolution of 55 mas, similar to archive data at higher frequencies. The proposed observation is fundamental to constrain the disk dust properties such as grain size, dust density, and temperature, because it is expected to trace optically thin emission, necessary to correctly infer the opacity spectral index. We expect to find evidence of very high dust grains (> some cm) around the brigth rings of LkCa15 if the dust trap mechanism is effective, and possibly very small grains (< 100 microns) in the gaps and the inner cavity of the disk. The goals that we plan to reach will help us to best understand if transition disk are a good scenario for dust growth and possibly the formation of pebbles.',\n"," 'Detecting and Mapping cis-OSSO on Venus. The identity of the UV absorber on Venus is a longstanding mystery that has withstood decades of dedicated scientific investigation. A recent hypothesis for the unknown absorber is the dimer of SO [aka OSSO]. With ALMA, we can not only detect sub-mm lines from this absorber, but we can also probe the mechanism by which it forms at altitudes of 70-100 km. We propose to observe cis-OSSO in the Venus mesosphere, and characterize its variations with Venusian longitude, latitude, and hemisphere. Verifying an anticorrelation with SO is an important test of the proposed formation mechanism, and to investigate this we will observe Venus at half-illumination. Cycle 6 is the best time for this measurement given that we will have nearly simultaneous temperature measurements from the Akatsuki spacecraft. We target 10 cis-OSSO and 2 SO lines in Band 6, using the 12m array in conjunction with the ACA. After line stacking, we expect to achieve a S/N per beam of ~3. This measurement will constitute the first detection of OSSO on Venus, and if we can confirm an anticorrelation with SO, it will be very strong evidence that OSSO is the UV absorber that has eluded planetary scientists for 40 years.',\n"," 'Tracing the Chemical Evolution of Active Galaxies. To trace the chemical evolution of galaxies, a detailed knowledge of abundance patterns is fundamental. Isotope ratios play a key role in such studies and are, almost exclusively, a domain of radio and (sub-)mm astronomy.

What ratios can be found, when observing objects beyond the Local Group, which drastically differ from those in the Miliky Way and the LMC? Is the Galaxy typical for its class or are its isotopic properties exceptional? And what does this imply for its evolutionary track? Such questions can only be tackled when using the extreme sensitivity of ALMA.

We propose to observe HD 50138 with ALMA, first among the FS CMa-type stars, in order to resolve its circumstellar disk at mm wavelengths. FS CMa stars constitute an enigmatic group of B[e] stars, whose evolutionary state is uncertain. High resolution observations in the infrared confirmed the existence of disks around these stars. However, the nature of FS CMa stars is still poorly understood. Key questions still remain: Is the disk formed from the ejected stellar material? Are the FS CMa disks different from those around pre-main-sequence stars, regarding structure and chemical composition? If FS CMa stars are not young objects, their disks should have been built up from inside-out. This process is expected to produce small disks with low amounts of cold dust compared to protoplanetary disks. To test this hypothesis, we will observe HD 50138 with a resolution of 25 mas (9 au), 40 times better than the best current millimeter observation. Our aim is to determine the origin of the circumstellar material by measuring the size of the emitting region in the millimeter continuum and in the CO lines. We will also study the kinematics of the circumstellar gas and search for outflows.',\n"," 'Eccentric gas motion in the protoplanetary disk around MWC 758. A massive planet in a protoplanetary disk could excite the disk to be eccentric, and the gas motion and dust distribution could have different amplitudes and phases of the eccentricity, depending on the dust-gas coupling and planet orbital eccentricity. ALMA continuum observations have revealed an eccentric dust ring in the protoplanetary disk around MWC 758, while the eccentricity of the gas motion in the MWC 758 disk has not yet been constrained. We have analyzed the ALMA archival 13CO data of MWC 758 and obtained a tentative detection of the gas eccentricity at a 2sigma level at the radius of the dust ring. Therefore, we propose to observe MWC 758 in CO isotopologue lines at high angular (0.1\") and velocity (0.05 km/s) resolutions to measure the possible gas eccentricity. With our proposed observations, we expect to detect any gas eccentricity larger than 0.03 (if present) in the MWC 758 disk. Through the comparison of the amplitudes and phases of the gas and dust eccentricity, we will be able to constrain the gas-dust coupling (or the Stokes number) and planet orbital eccentricity in the MWC 758 disk.',\n"," 'Probing the active collimation region of the relativistic jet in 3C 273. We propose an ultra-high resolution, full-polarimetric observation of 3C 273 at 86 GHz with GMVA+ALMA. The primary objective is resolving the transverse structure at the inner ~10^5 Rs of the quasar jet for the first time by including ALMA. The resolved profile of the jet collimation can address the location of the launching point of the visible jet in quasars. Secondly, we aim to obtain the deepest linear polarization image of this jet-collimating region with the highest angular resolution ever. This enables probing the spatial distribution of the Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) at inner ~10^4-10^5 Rs, combining with high-sensitive observations with VLBA+Effelsberg at 15/22/43 GHz already proposed. The obtained RM distribution will provide unique information of the magnetized plasma distribution surrounding the jet, combining with previous lower frequency observations. Furthermore, the RM-corrected linear polarization map and the transverse RM distribution will provide the three-dimensional magnetic-field configuration of the actively collimating jet. Overall properties revealed in the proposed observations will constrain the global environment around the quasar jet.',\n"," 'Atomic carbon in a prototypical barred-spiral galaxy M83. Atomic carbon (CI) has been proposed as a tracer of molecular mass alternative to CO, especially in high-redshift galaxies where cosmic-ray induced reactions can destroy CO, or in outflows where the optical depth of CO is unknown. However, the CI abundance with respect to H2 varies with many other factors such as turbulence, cloud age, UV field, and density. We first need to understand how the CI abundance changes in a nearby galaxy where the physical conditions are well known. We propose to map the closest and brightest face-on barred-spiral galaxy M83 in CI over 5.2kpc x 5.7 kpc covering various galactic structures such as the galactic center, bar, arm, and interarm. We will examine the variation of the ratio between two major forms of carbon, CI and CO, among these galactic structures and examine the influence of turbulence, cosmic rays, and UV radiation. We already have larger and deep ALMA maps of CO 1-0 and 2-1. We will also compare the chemical state from CI/CO with the excitation inferred from CO(2-1)/(1-0). Our detailed analysis in M83 will serve as the best reference for CI studies in galaxies under the wide variety of physical conditions we cover.',\n"," 'Oscillations and waves contributing to coronal heating on the Sun.

Recent observations by the Hinode and IRIS satellites have revealed that the solar atmosphere is filled with small-scale oscillations caused by waves that can carry sufficient energy to heat the corona. However, it is unclear whether waves actually contribute to coronal heating, because of the difficulty in measuring the temperatures of chromospheric features in the corona. ALMA is the first instrument that can directly measure the temperature of the highly-resolved chromosphere. We propose observations of prominences above the solar limb for several hours jointly with ALMA and IRIS. By comparing a temperature map by ALMA with the spatial distribution of waves along fine structures of prominences observed by IRIS, we can directly investigate the temperature variation associated with the presence of waves. The relationship between temperature changes and wave properties will provide critical information about the mechanism of wave dissipation and thus tightly constrain wave-heating models.',\n"," 'Tracing the heritage of cometary water through the HDO/H2O ratio. Materials throughout the Solar System exhibit differing degrees of deuterium enrichment, the measurement of which provides clues to their origin and thermal history. We propose to measure the D/H ratio in water in comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, to test whether the cometary water originated in the interstellar medium or has been significantly processed. Simultaneous emission line observations of other species will be used to measure the temperature and will allow the retrieval of accurate production rates using a non-LTE excitation code. The proposed measurements will advance our knowledge of how and where comets formed, and help elucidate the role of comets in delivering water and organics to primitive planetary surfaces.',\n"," '0.1 Resolution mm-Interferometry of a Highly Magnified Lyman Break Galaxy at z=3.07. We propose deep and high spatial resolution (0.1) 3-mm ALMA observations of the CO(3-2) line emission in a z=3.07 bright gravitationally lensed Lyman Break Galaxy, LBG J213512.73-010143 (the `Cosmic Eye). This LBG has previously been detected in CO(3-2) and CO(1-0) at lower resolution. Our previous 0.6 resolution ALMA CO(3-2) reveals a molecular gas morphology roughly following the lensing arc, but unfortunately is too noisy (~3-sigma) to accurately map it back into the source plane reconstruction using the HST-based lensing model. More sensitive and higher resolution observations in an extended ALMA configuration of this magnified system will spatially resolve the line emission at ~0.1 and allow us to map and dissect the molecular gas distribution on scales of ~200 pc (in the source plane). Not only will the proposed observations allow us to determine the size of the CO emitting region and the dynamical mass, but they will also enable us to unambiguously determine the nature of this system and the interplay/distribution of CO emission and star formation activity in the progenitor of a `normal galaxy in the throes of formation.',\n"," 'Studying the Late-Time Evolution of SN 1978K. We propose high signal-to-noise observations in ALMA bands 3, 4, 6, and 7 of SN 1978K, a remarkable Type IIn supernova that remains bright at X-ray through radio wavelengths 37 years after its explosion. Motivated by our Australia Telescope Compact Array detections of the target at 34 and 94 GHz in September 2014, we aim to characterise the spectral energy distribution between 90 and 350 GHz. SN 1978K is the first old extragalactic supernova (or young SNR) to be detected in the millimeter, apart from SN 1987A. Thus observations of SN 1978K will serve as a pathfinder for younger supernovae. Furthermore, our ongoing program of multi-wavelength observations has shown that now is a particularly important time to study the source: our recent X-ray and UV/optical observations have shown an onset of chromatic fading, after these remained constant for a decade.',\n"," 'Molecules and Dust Near Embedded Star Clusters in He 2-10. Super Star Clusters (SSCs) hold large concentrations of O stars and can have great impact on their host galaxies. Evolution is fast in SSCs; they can create huge amounts of metals, and thus of dust, in their first few million years. The dwarf starburst galaxy He 2-10 has created many massive young star clusters in a region ~150 pc across. Where is the dust in He 2-10? What is the Gas-to-Dust (GTD) or CO-to-dust ratio in this intense starburst, and does it vary across the star forming region? How do the dense CO clouds compare, in 3D, to the ionized gas? ALMA imaging of continuum at 850microns, along with CO(3-2) spectra, can address these questions.',\n"," 'N79: The Once and Future 30 Doradus. We have discovered the existence of a massive and extended star forming complex in the unexplored southwest region of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previously known as N79, this region harbors the highest density of massive Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in the LMC, only to be challenged by 30 Doradus. Moreover, at the heart of this cluster lies a massive YSO with a lower limit on luminosity of 1.5x10^6 L_sun, closely matching the luminosity of the central ionizing cluster of 30 Doradus, R136 (1.0×10^7 L_sun; Anderson et al. 2009). Thus, we have found the once and future 30 Doradus. This region coincides with the tip of the northern sprial arm of the LMC (DOnghia & Fox 2016). Previous ALMA (Cycle 2) observations of this region was of a small 1 x 1 region centered on the most luminous YSO. This proposal focuses on a larger region and will capture the three main giant molecular clouds (GMCs) observed in N79, which harbor a large fraction of young massive stars in the region. We propose to observe 13CO, C18O, CS, and H40 to determine the column density, probe the dense gas, and calculate the hardness of the radiation from the star formation activity in the N79 region.',\n"," 'Molecular Outflows in Dusty Gravitionally Lensed QSOs at z=2-5. Outflows are crucially important for the gas budget and evolution of luminous star forming galaxies and AGNs. QSOs, the most luminous AGNs, are believed to responsible for quenching star formation in the most massive galaxies. This suggests dusty QSOs are currently in a transition phase. The small fraction of star forming galaxies identified as as a QSO indicates this is a short (~1Myr) and extremely explosive phase. At the peak of star formation and AGN accretion at z=2-4, such outflows must play a major role, but become extremely difficult to observe in CO. In Cycle 3, we carried out a very successful pilot project to test OH+ as a tracer of high-z outflows. OH+ is a sensitive outflow tracer in local IR-luminous galaxies, and lies close to CO(9-8) so that both lines can be observed in one ALMA tuning. The OH+ line is detected in absorption, blueshifted with respect to the CO(9-8) which measures the warm gas in the disk. In this pilot study we aim to test the feasibility of detecting molecular outflows with OH+ in dusty QSOs at z=2-4, to compare with outflows in DSFGs at the same redshift and investigate the mass outflow rate and AGN luminosity relationship seen at low redshift.',\n"," 'The failure of galactic star formation relations on sub-galactic scales: A direct probe of the physics of star formation. This is a resubmission of our successful Cycle 2 project that mapped CO(1-0) emission over a quarter of the optical disk of the nearby flocculent spiral NGC300. The delivered 12m- & 7m-array data yielded a fantastic high spatial (23pc) and spectral (0.32km/s) resolution map that reveal 200 molecular clouds (MCs), making this one of the finest (extragalactic) MC samples. We apply a newly developed model - the uncertainty principle of star formation (SF) - that relates the scatter in resolved SF and gas tracers (i.e. the breakdown of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation on small scales) to the evolutionary state of SF regions. The model derives the timescale of MC formation, the duration of SF, and efficiency of feedback - all critical parameters of galaxy evolution that are hotly debated. We also plan to smooth the data to lower resolution to calibrate the model for future ALMA observations of more distant galaxies, opening up a much wider range of environments. However, for our method to yield correct timescale measurements and to contrast our dataset to more distant galaxies, we need to have flux-complete observations, therefore we request the completion of the total power observations.',\n"," 'ALMAs First Look at the Crab Pulsar. Since its discovery in 1968, the Crab pulsar (B0531+21) has been heavily studied in almost every wavelength band from the radio through to the high-energy gamma ray. One of the last remaining gaps in the SED falls in the mm/sub-mm regime; here we propose to fill this gap using ALMA. Specifically, we seek to obtain continuum observations of the phase-averaged (i.e., not resolving the pulse in time) emission at 97.5 GHz (Band 3), 340 GHz (Band 7), and 665 GHz (Band 9). These observations will build an important bridge between the declining flux densities (with frequency) at radio wavelengths and the increasing flux densities at infrared wavelengths. The spectral \"turnover\" that must exist at intermediate wavelengths, which we will probe with the proposed observations, corresponds to a transition between coherent and incoherent emission mechanisms. Under certain assumptions regarding the underlying theory, the wavelength at which this turnover occurs can constrain the separations between particles in the parcels of plasma producing the emission. We request observations in three different ALMA bands to ensure that we can constrain the location of this turnover in the SED.',\n"," 'Panta Rei: the mass and energy flow from parsec to sub-parsec scales in star-forming regions. The Panta Rei project aims to understand the dynamics in massive star-forming regions by investigating the interplay between turbulence and gravity at the parsec and sub-parsec scales. Whether the flow of mass and energy at various spatial scales is driven by the turbulent cascade or by gravitationally ordered motions is still highly debated, with a crucial question still open: is gravity the leading mechanism to assemble material already at large scales, as predicted in theories such as the hierarchical, global collapse (Vazquez-Semadeni et al. 2019), or is it turbulence that drives the fragmentation at parsec and sub-parsec scales, as predicted in models such as the inertial inflow (Padoan et al. 2020)? We propose to observe with ACA and TP arrays 20 sources and their parsec-scale environments with a combination of optically thin and optically thick lines that together will unequivocally prove the nature of the multi-scale motions and direct us towards the understanding of the massive star-formation mechanism.',\n"," 'Feeding and feedback in two nearby Seyfert galaxies. We propose to map the morphology and kinematics of the cold dense gas in two nearby Seyfert nuclei at the unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.45\"=22-24 pc. Up to now, our NUGA study of molecular gas in AGN circumnuclear regions has shown that embedded, kinematically decoupled bars are able to feed the nuclei; however, we have been hampered by insufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to trace the gas inside a 100 pc radius. In two Seyfert galaxies known to have embedded bars, NGC 1433 and NGC 1566 (at distances of 10 and 11 Mpc), ALMA will enable us for the first time to examine the ultimate contenders of nuclear gas fueling, (nuclear bars, dynamical friction, and/or turbulent viscosity). We will also be able to probe feedback processes driven by the AGN (entrained molecular outflows, P-cygni profiles in CO(3-2), HCO+(4-3)). We will improve our resolution by a factor ~5 (going to higher frequency and more nearby objects), and sensitivity by a factor 2, with respect to our previous results on NUGA. Finally, our complete ancillary multiwavelength data set, including high-resolution HST images, will enable us to examine with unparalleled detail outflows in ionized gas, dust emission in the mid- and far-infrared, and dust obscuration around AGN. In total we ask for 5hours observing time, including calibrations.',\n"," 'Disk demographics in Lupus. We propose to survey the gas and dust in 98 protoplanetary disks in the nearby Lupus star-forming region. This is a complete sample of all known optically visible stars with large infrared excesses and stellar masses > 0.1 solar. We will observe the CO, 13CO and C18O 2-1 lines and have developed models to derive gas masses. We will image with a resolution that corresponds to 20AU in radius while maintaining sensitivity over the entire disk. We expect to detect almost all disks in the continuum and measure sub-Jupiter masses of gas. From the resolved images, we will determine radial profiles of the gas, dust, and gas-to-dust ratio, as well as characterize the prevalence of dust holes and asymmetries. This efficient, large, and complete survey will provide an unbiased view of the gas and dust properties in young planet-forming disks, and is complemented by our VLT optical-infrared spectroscopic survey of the host stars.',\n"," 'ALMA-SPONGE: the role of neutral hydrogen in diffuse interstellar chemistry. 21-SPONGE has obtained very sensitive HI absorption spectra in the direction of 57 background radio sources. For about 300 individual velocity components we measured HI excitation tempertaure (Ts), HI column density, and the sonic Mach number (Ms), as well as the total HI column density for thermaly-stable and unstable phases along each line of sight. For a sample of 22 21-SPONGE source we propose to measure absorption of key molecular species in the diffuse ISM: HCO+, HCN, HNC and CCH. While commonly detected in the diffuse ISM, abundances and abundance variations of these species are still not well understood. The HI spectroscopy provides key information regarding the kinematic temperature of gas, and its turbulent properties, allowing us to search for environmental and dynamical effects that play an important role in molecule formation and evolution. The key scientific objectives are: compare how the column density and line width of different species correlate with Ts and Ms, investigate the correlations of column densities of different species and compare with model predictions; and investigate the role of UV radiation field on both gas temperature and chemistry.',\n"," 'Dust at Cosmic Dawn: Confirming the Highest Redshift Galaxy Candidate. We seek 7.8 hours of DDT time in bands 3+7 to spectroscopically confirm a Dusty Star Forming Galaxy (DSFG) as potentially at z~9. If at z~9, this would be the highest redshift spec-z galaxy and DSFG found to-date, 500Myr after the Big Bang, with an unprecedented 400 million solar masses of dust and SFR~700Msun/yr, which challenges our understanding of early Universe dust formation and massive galaxy formation. While it has been identified as a DSFG for years with unknown redshift, the delivery of 2mm ALMA data (5 hours after the Cycle 7 deadline) suggests a very high redshift solution (in conjunction with other millimeter constraints, including upper limits at lambda<850um). The optical/near-infrared data (very deep CANDELS HST imaging+SPLASH IRAC) is most consistent with a dusty galaxy at z~10. We have reprocessed ALMA Band 3 data and detect two lines at marginal significance (~4sigma) that coincide with CO(8-7) and CO(9-8) at z=9.3 (luminosities consistent with expectation). We propose to: (a) obtain higher S/N of the candidate lines in band 3, (b) rule out lower redshift solutions with one additional band 3 tuning, and (c) target the OIII emission line in band 7.',\n"," 'The feedback effect from massive stars on the fragmentation of dense structures. The relative importance of the mechanisms that shape the internal structure of the star forming clouds is one of the most important questions in the star formation community. The extraordinary capabilities offered by ALMA will allow us to obtain detailed map of the dense gas down to size scales ~0.02 pc, adequate to resolve the structures associated to dense cores and complex filamentary structures. We propose to observe the dense gas at 1 mm over the two different regions located in the Carina Nebula already observed at 3 mm with ALMA Cycle 4. We will use these maps to investigate the role that external pressure plays on determining the densest components inside the diffuse medium in these clouds. The stability status of the identified structures will be used to assess whether these are supported by external pressure, and at which scale the gravity becomes the dominant force. Detailed comparison of the distribution of the dense gas and the location of young stellar objects will shed light on the dependence of the star-formation threshold on the external pressure in these clouds with different level of impact of stellar feedback.',\n"," 'Low luminosity millimeter survey behind a strong lensing cluster. We propose to perform continuum observations at 1.3 mm (Band 6) in the strong magnification region (x > 10) of the massive cluster Abell 1689. We can cover a survey area of 4 arcmin2 down to an intrinsic (lensing-corrected) sensitivity of 0.05 mJy (4sigma). We expect to detect ~ 12 continuum sources according to current models. This will allow us to complement the studies of brighter continuum sources and derive their relative contribution to the star-formation rate and cosmic infrared background. At the same time, we will measure the CO line flux of 3 submm galaxies at z=2.5-2.7 discovered with SCUBA in this field, and we will cover the wavelength of the CO line for a sample of 30 other sources at 2.5',\n"," 'Resolved CO Excitation across Nearby Galaxy Disks. We propose simultaneous observations of the rest-frame 345.795GHz CO (3-2) and 356.734GHz HCO+ (4-3) transitions within two selected PHANGS galaxies. We aim to investigate variations of the CO spectral energy distribution in dependence of readily available quantities such as stellar surface density, (molecular) gas surface density or ionization parameter. For both targets we already have a plethora of molecular spectra (CO, HCN, HCO+) on-hand. Inclusion of the proposed lines, will immediately allow us to perform novel radiative transfer models in order to constrain the density and temperature of the molecular gas.',\n"," 'Energy evaluation of micro- and nano-flaring heating events in solar active regions. Reconnection events in nanoflare energy range are a candidate for the heating of the corona in active regions. The number distribution of reconnection events as a function of energy is essential to evaluate the importance of nanoflares in the heating. ALMA observations would provide a new capability for newly exploring the released energy of reconnection events in the energy range around 10^23-10^24 ergs. Transient heating of the plasma at the upper chromosphere caused by reconnection events is observed as the transient increase in brightness temperature. The time series of the ALMA measurements, coordinated with Hinode and IRIS observations, are investigated to establish a new method for estimating the amount of the energy released by each of small reconnection events.',\n"," 'Globular cluster formation: caught in the act. Clusters are the building blocks of galaxies and the nurseries of most stellar systems. Despite their importance, even the fundamental question of whether a single mechanism can describe cluster formation across the mass range from open clusters to globular clusters remains unclear. Answering this question requires observations of a clusters natal dust and gas well before the onset of star formation. We have identified an extreme molecular cloud that appears to be on the verge of forming a massive cluster. This cloud, G0.25+0.02, is very cold, massive, and dense with no obvious star formation and shows tantalizing evidence that it is highly substructured and, thus, may be undergoing hierarchical fragmentation. Using the ALMA early science extended configuration we aim to obtain a ~3 x 1 arcmin mosaic of the dust continuum and molecular line emission across this cloud at 90 GHz. These observations will reveal the location, mass, and kinematics of the small-scale fragments within the cloud allowing us to distinguish between competing cluster formation models. These observations can only be achieved with the order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and dynamic range provided by ALMA. Determining whether clusters form via a single mechanism across the entire mass range has profound implications: if confirmed, this implies our knowledge of nearby cluster formation can be used as framework to understand star formation across cosmic time, back to globular clusters ~10Gyr ago. We speculate that the cloud G0.25+0.02 may represent the precursor to a modern day globular cluster.',\n"," 'The first extragalactic, extreme, low-metallicity tests of the core mass function and molecular cloud structure. The stellar initial mass function (IMF) may be predetermined by the mass distribution of 0.1--0.5pc dense cores in a cloud. Does the IMF result from a universal core mass function (CMF)? Milky Way molecular clouds follow correlations between size, linewidth, and mass; at ~30pc resolution, clouds follow the same relations in reduced metallicity dwarf galaxies, i.e. conditions similar to the era of galaxy formation. Is molecular cloud substructure universal? Scales of ~0.1pc are critical to address either of these questions: 0.1pc is the sonic scale at which gravity is expected to dominate turbulent motions in a cloud. Probably not coincidentally, it is also the characteristic scale related to the turnover in the dense core mass function. This scale is now reachable outside of the Milky Way with ALMA. 30 Doradus provides an ideal setting in which to test molecular cloud properties in an extreme setting. Our Cycle 0 observations of 30 Doradus analyzed >100 solar mass, 0.5pc clumps. We can now build on that with an informed study of solar mass, 0.1pc cores.',\n"," 'Probing the origins of [CII] emission in the Epoch of Reionization. We propose band 5 observations to measure [NII]205um emission lines from three [CII] luminous galaxies in the epoch of reionization (at z=6.5-7.7). These galaxies were recently spectroscopically confirmed by their luminous [CII]158um emission lines as a part of an ALMA observing campaign. While the recent [CII]158um line observation provided a large number of detections, the detailed origins of [CII] lines are still elusive. Despite the uncertainty, [CII]158um emission lines are used as tracers of several galaxy properties (e.g., star formation rates and neutral gas mass). To accurately understand the origins of the [CII] emission line and to understand the conditions of ionized and photodissociation gas, multiple emission line observations are needed. By the proposed observations of [NII] 205um we will achieve the following: (1) investigate whether PDR or HII regions are the dominant source of [CII] line, (2) model ionized and photodissociation gas by combining existing and incoming observations. These observation provide a showcase of emission line from ionized gas in the EoR, in conjunction with the scheduled Cycle-1 JWST observations.',\n"," 'The Origin of z < 1 Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers: Completing the Census. The population of Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption (DLA) systems seen towards background QSOs probe the bulk of the neutral hydrogen in the universe. Galaxies believed to be responsible for the absorption have been identified toward about two dozen DLAs at z < 1 through optical and IR imaging. The molecular content of some of these DLAs are currently being studied by ALMA through maps of spatially resolved CO emission, which will lead to important insights into the origin of DLA systems. However, a subset is currently being neglected: specifically, 3 DLA fields where no absorbing galaxy has been found, and 3 DLAs where the putative absorber is more than 20 kpc from the line of sight --- a distance not in keeping with the expectations for low luminosity galaxy disks --- do not yet feature in ALMAs programs. We propose observing CO(2-1) emission from precisely these systems. We aim to locate the absorbing structures in cases where no galaxies have yet been found, and where large galaxy disks are not expected. Complementing existing ALMA programs, our data will complete the census of z < 1 galaxies responsible for DLAs and avoid any bias in the interpretation of their origin.',\n"," 'The Assembly of Early Massive Quasar Host Galaxies. The existence of billion solar mass black holes (BHs) at z>~6.5 and the detection of strong gas and dust emission in their hosts indicate fast build-up of both the earliest supermassive BHs and their massive host galaxies. Recent ALMA [CII] imaging of z~6.5 quasars suggests a diverse range of morphology and kinematics, indicating a complex growth history of these massive systems. However, limited by the spatial resolution and the lack of detection of the hosts stellar light, the assembly history of these massive galaxies are still poorly understood. We propose ALMA high resolution (~0.1\" - 0.17\") observations for five remaining targets from a representative sample of bright quasar host galaxies at z>6.5. Together with the approved high resolution JWST observations for the stellar emission in rest-frame UV/optical, the proposed ALMA sample will provide unparalleled constraints on the gas structure, morphology, kinematics, dynamical mass, spatially resolved star formation surface density, and dust reddening of these massive hosts, which will finally enable us to understand the assembly of the first massive galaxies in a statistical manner from a multi-wavelength perspective.',\n"," 'Through the magnifying glass: a unique view of the low-metallicity ISM at high redshift. Low-mass galaxies produce up to half of the new stars at the heyday of galaxy formation, yet our knowledge of the physical processes at this epoch is almost solely based on extrapolations from either lower redshifts or higher-mass galaxies. An exceptionally rare lensing configuration has 30-fold magnified a dwarf starburst galaxy at z=1.847, providing a unique opportunity to explore the ISM conditions in this important but thus far unobservable regime of galaxy evolution. We propose to take advantage of the magnification of the lensed galaxy SL2SJ02176-0513, a 10% solar metallicity, 10^8 Msol dwarf with a star formation rate of 10 Msol/yr, combined with ALMAs unmatched resolution and sensitivity, to obtain the first [CII] map of a metal-poor, high-redshift galaxy at ~250 pc resolution. By combining this information with existing 0.20 arcsec-resolution UV and emission line maps from HST, we will verify if and how the [CII] line traces star formation in young galaxies. These observations will provide the first ever spatially and kinematically resolved study of the cold ISM in a low-metallicity galaxy at z~2.

Extended cool gas filaments are common in brightest cluster galaxies located in cool core galaxy clusters but, at 46 kpc in length (38 arcsec), A1795 hosts the most spectacular example. Emitting soft X-rays, Halpha and molecular lines, this filament likely traces a wake of gas cooling from the cluster atmosphere onto the central galaxy. This stream of cooling gas may eventually supply fuel to the the central powerful FR I radio source 4C 26.42, which has inflated two large radio bubbles that have displaced and compressed the surrounding medium. Knots of young star clusters clearly trace the edges of the radio lobes where the jets have collided with dense clouds and triggered their collapse into intense starbursts. We propose ALMA observations to study the spatial and velocity distribution of molecular gas in the core of A1795 to reveal the steady condensation of gas cooling from the cluster and examine the nature of jet-cloud interactions.',\n"," 'Shedding light on the completion of reionization by ALMA [CII] Observations. We propose [CII] line observations for high-z Ly$¥alpha$ emitters at $z = 6.5$ and $5.7$ with Band 6 and 7 to estimate a reliable $x_{HI}$, and reveal when the reionization completes. In the past, the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_{HI}$, has been estimated from evolution of Ly$¥alpha$ luminosity function and Ly$¥alpha$ escaping fraction, $f_{esc}^{Ly¥alpha}$, with Ly$¥alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) in conjunction with theoretical models. These observations have indicated that $x_{HI}$ increases from $x_{HI}=0$ at $z=5.7$ to $0-0.4$ at $z=6.5$, but the large uncertainty of $x_{HI}$ estimates raised by model parameter choices is too large to conclude that the reionization completes between $z=5.7$ and $6.5$. Based on our [CII] observations by ALMA, we will evaluate $x_{HI}$ by the following two approaches. One is to estimate a velocity offset ($¥Delta v$) between the systemic velocity and Ly$¥alpha$ line of LAEs. The $¥Delta v$ value is a key parameter in the theoretical models. The observed [CII] line profile will give us a systemic velocity. Combining the available Ly$¥alpha$ velocity, we will obtain $¥Delta v$. The second is to estimate $f_{esc}^{Ly¥alpha}$ from a [CII] luminosity, $L_{[CII]}$. Using $L_{[CII]}$, we will estimate $f_{esc}^{Ly¥alpha}$ independent of theoretical assumptions such as dust extinction. By combining these two approaches, we will be able to estimate $x_{HI}$ more accurately, and identify the epoch of the reionization completion. In contrast to related proposal of Ouchi et al. that aims to measure $x_{HI}$ at the heart of the reionization era ($z=7.3$), our program will specify the epoch of reionization completion based on the observations of two key epochs ($z = 5.7$ and $6.5$) that are probably near the end of reionization. Our Band 6 and 7 observations will provide not only our [CII] line observations, but also 1.2mm and 1.1mm continuum emission, respectively. These continuum emission will be used to evaluate dust extinction of LAEs that will doubly check the validity of our $x_{HI}$ estimates and reveal the dust properties of LAEs. Our observations by ALMA will make a breakthrough to determine the epoch of reionization, and bring new insights on properties of LAEs.',\n"," 'After the Storm: Mapping the Highly Disturbed Molecular Gas in the Taffy Galaxies and Bridge. We propose to map CO emission in the galaxies and molecular bridge of the Taffy system (UGC 12914/5). We will use the observations to explore the physical conditions of the gas in the highly turbulent bridge created by the dramatic head-on collision of the two gas rich galaxies, which unlike most major mergers is not forming stars at a high rate. We will attempt to explore the structure of the clumpy molecular clouds in a diverse range of conditions in the turbulent gas. We will investigate the kinematics of the gas down to small scales to measure how kinetic energy is dissipated across the bridge. We will also use the CO SLED to probe the density and temperature of two peculiar regions to separate spatially the cool diffuse, and warm dense gas. We will determine how turbulence and shocks dissipate energy, and how this correlates with star formation. The study of this nearby turbulent system in great detail may help us understand how turbulence can inhibit star formation at modest redshifts when galaxies were more gas-rich, and when the star formation rate density began to rapidly decline.',\n"," 'Revealing Sub-structures in a Very Low Mass Disk. Earth-mass planets have been detected around very low mass (VLM) stars, as TRAPPIST-1. However, the very first steps towards their formation, in particular, grain growth, are still not understood, as the conditions in disks around VLM stars are extremely unfavorable. We propose here a very high resolution and sensitivity study of the dust emission of a VLM star in Taurus (CIDA 1, Mstar~0.1 Msun), where we have detected clear evidence of an inner cavity of radius ~20 AU (Pinilla et al. 2018), as well as indications for mm-size grain trapping. A Saturn-mass planet is required to open such a gap, but it would not be sufficient to trap dust grains and explain the low observed mm spectral index of CIDA 1 (Ricci et al. 2014). Dust evolution models instead predict that dust trapping in VLM stars disks can only occur in multiple dust traps, revealed as multiple rings in millimeter images. The requested observations of CIDA 1 at 0.870 and 2 mm with a resolution of 0.035\" (~5 astronomical units) will allow us to spatially detect small-scale structures with size comparable to the disk scale height and directly test dust trapping models.',\n"," 'Clumps of Molecular Gas in the Turbulent, Gas-Rich DYNAMO Galaxies. Normal, main-sequence galaxies at cosmic noon have morphologies dominated by massive star forming clumps. These clumps are potentially linked to the morphological transformation of these galaxies, if they are long-lived, bound structures. Yet, aside from a handful of extreme systems, it is difficult to acquire high-resolution observations to characterize the molecular gas content and depletion times of clumps. We will address this with ALMA CO(3-2) mapping at 0.2 (~280 pc) in 5 nearby DYNAMO galaxies, whose properties are very similar to those of main-sequence galaxies at z ~ 1-3. On a sample of 80 clumps we will: study the gas fraction, depletion times, and kinematics of individual clumps to determine if (1) clumps of star formation and stellar mass correspond to those of molecular gas, and (2) determine if they are bound (and thus long-lived) through their virial parameter. These observations will allow us to provide valuable insight into currently outstanding questions that are crucial for deriving models of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Cold gas and dust distributions around a precisely localized AGN in a dust-obscured star-forming disk at z = 1.9. We propose high-fidelity 0.06-resolution CO(4-3) observations of an Einstein ring of a typical star-forming galaxy (SFG) at z = 1.9. This galaxy is unique because the combination of VLA and PdBI radio and dust continuum observations have pinpointed the location of its AGN by means of a spatially-resolved radio excess in the source plane. The AGN appears to be embedded in an intensely star-forming disk six kpc across. Such a precise knowledge of the AGN position within a galaxy is rare because SFGs at z ~ 2 are commonly heavily obscured by dust. The proposed observations will map the cold gas and dust with ~100 pc resolution. Our goals are to (1) capture the gas surface density from the scales of kpc down to ~100 pc of the MBH to search for the gas density enhancement predicted by the simulations of the self-instability facilitated AGN fueling mechanism; (2) search for (or provide constraint on) the ~100-pc-sized star-forming clumps whose clusters are predicted to have led to the observed kpc-sized star-forming clumps. This substantial investment of ALMA time will pioneer the combination of ALMA and radio observations to study the dust-obscured sub-galactic structure at z ~ 2.',\n"," 'Unraveling the multiscale emission of the unique gamma-ray emitter PMN J1603-4904 with ALMA. Gamma-ray sources are the most energetic objects in the Universe. The unique extragalactic jet PMN J1603-4904 is one of the most exciting candidates of a young radio galaxy detected at gamma-rays, of which only one other example is known so far. Hence, it is a perfect laboratory to study high-energy emission and jet formation processes of newly born active galaxies. We propose ALMA continuum observations (band 3, 4 & 6) to perform the first ever study of the large-scale radio morphology which is estimated to be about 0.6 kpc (about 0.2 arcsec) in size. This study can only be achieved by ALMA and is crucial to confirm the young radio galaxy classification. The data will play a decisive role in closing the resolution gap between our VLBI and Chandra images and will lead to the first multi-scale picture of PMN J1603-4904 which is essential to test jet models.',\n"," 'Probing the polarized innermost structure of the relativistic jet of 4C +01.28. We want to probe the polarized fine structure of the nuclear region of the blazar 4C +01.28 (B1055+018, J1058+015) via 1.3-mm EHT+ALMA observations. 4C +01.28 has a mm flux density over 3 Jy, highly variable up to high energies. Recent GMVA 3-mm results show a compact polarized core with a faint relativistic jet. It is an excellent target for ALMA with high brigtness at the celestial equator. At cm-wavelengths, its polarized structure consists of a two-component structure, with an inner spine with a transverse B field and a distinct boundary layer (the sheath) with a longitudinal B field. Our observations will provide a deep polarization image of the stratified jet at ~30uas resolution, probing uniquely whether the spine-sheath structure extends to jet base and testing, on scales of 1200 R_s, the different MHD jet formation models: Blandford-Payne models, where the jet is anchored to magnetized rotating disks, should result in an edge-brightened polarisation up to the base of the jet; or Blandford-Znajek models, where the jet is driven by the BH spin, result in a more compact footprint of the jet, which implies a higher opacity and a smaller polarisation degree.',\n"," 'Assembling the first intra-cluster medium: SPT2459-56 at z=4.3. We propose a high-risk but very high-reward proposal to search for the intra-cluster medium (ICM) via the thermal SZ-effect in an extremely massive proto-cluster at z=4.31. ALMA observations show SPT2349-56 contains 30 dusty, intensely star forming dusty galaxies within 100~kpc radius (total SFR~10,000 Msun/yr), with a bound dynamical mass of M200 ~ 10^13 Msun and a Coma-like descendant by z=0. This structure presents a unique opportunity to study the formation of the ICM, two Gyr earlier than any SZ or X-ray detected cluster, when processes that heat the ICM and establish the central entropy should be operating. A first detection of the forming high-z ICM is within reach of deep ALMA data, through 25hrs of compact configuration time at 93GHz, with the C-1/C-2 configs 3.6\" beam well matched to the expected 8\" size of the compact tSZ signal. Modelling and removing the emissive SMG sources can be achieved with archival and the proposed data itself. The band-3 data will also have a legacy value in ultra-deep constraints on the diffuse CO(4-3) gas in the core. This will enable a path finding science benchmark for Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4 to search for distant cluster SZ.',\n"," 'CO spectral imaging the hosts of the most extremely-luminous AGNs.. A new class of extremely luminous active galaxies, `HotDOGs, were found by mid-IR selection from the WISE all-sky survey. HotDOGs are a population of powerful AGNs with characteristic hot far-IR SEDs, and luminosities reaching over 10^14 Lsun. They have well-defined redshifts, luminosities & SEDs, and are as numerous as comparably-luminous optical QSOs. HotDOGs luminosity is dominated by very-obscured AGN, unlike either low-z ULIRGs or high-z submm-selected dust-enshrouded galaxies (SMGs/DSFGs). HotDOGs likely offer key tests of feedback/accretion. We propose sensitive Band-3 spectroscopy of the ISM in a complete sample of 10 HotDOGs/host galaxies, to reveal the size, morphology and dynamics of the molecular gas; and thus give the abundance of fuel for their AGNs, and the strength of their outflows. HotDOGs are the MOST extreme galaxies, forming their blackholes and undergoing feedback at the greatest rates: our spectral probe of their brightest CO lines will reveal the processing and consumption of gas in these dramatically luminous galaxies at an epoch when galaxy formation was at its most intense, and perhaps show how this remarkable phase is initiated and terminated.',\n"," 'ALMA Proper Motions in the B335 Jet: Connect an Ejection Event to an Accretion Burst.. We will observe B335 in the CO transitions at 1.3 mm to determine the proper motion of an ejecta associated with a luminosity burst. B335 has undergone strong luminosity evolution over the last 6 years, with an increase of a factor of 5-7 starting in 2017. Previous CO observations showed a high velocity structure in the blue outflow lobe. Recent JWST observations found a region of strong near-infrared CO band emission farther from the protostar. Plausible ejection velocities allow these to be the same structure, but we need new ALMA observations to definitely establish this association and measure the proper motion. These observations will provide a connection between accretion surges and outflow structures that can be used to trace the history of episodic accretion in this and other sources.',\n"," 'Fragmentation, rotation and infall of a massive disk. Understanding the fragmentation, rotation and infall properties of disks around young high-mass stars remains one of the key questions in star formation research. The unique capabilities of ALMA allow us to probe the physical properties of the gas and dust in the inner envelope and disk region around the central high-mass star. Specifically, using the high-frequency band 9 receivers with 1km baselines at a spatial resolution of ~0.1, we can for the first time resolve the predicted fragmentation scales on the order of several hundred AU. Simultaneously, we can study the gas infall rates via absorption line studies against the bright submm continuum emission. Therefore, we propose to observe one of the best 10^5 Lsun high-mass disk/outflow candidates G351.77-0.54 at 690GHz in continuum and spectral line emission. Important questions which these observations will address are: What are the fragmentation properties of this massive disk candidate? How large are the infall rates close to the protostar? Are the kinematic properties of the disk-like structure of Keplerian nature or still dominated by a flattened envelope? Are the outflow properties related to those of the accretion disk?',\n"," 'Resolving the debris disk and its structure around the young M dwarf TWA 7. Debris disks can be seen as the left-overs of giant planet formation and the possible nurseries of rocky planets. While M-type stars out-number more massive stars we know very little about the time evolution of their circumstellar disks at ages older than ~10 Myr. It is unclear whether the scarcity of debris disks around M dwarfs is related to instrumental sensitivity or to dissipation processes that are specific to low mass stars such as stellar winds. Spatially resolved submm observations of the young debris disk around TWA7 may provide new insights on the dynamical evolution of these circumstellar disks as well as on the dust properties (e.g., size distribution, multiple-disk components, as suggested by the SED). Emission lines detected in spectroscopic observations also suggest the presence of winds, making TWA 7 a very interesting target to possibly characterize disk-winds interactions. Variable absorption components detected on top of the chromospheric emission on the CaII H&K lines suggest the presence of some gaseous component/s; either residual left overs of the primordial disk or, some second generation gas originated for example by evaporating bodies.',\n"," 'The curious case of the ~40 Myr accreting M dwarfs: Late-stage protoplanetary disks or gas-rich debris disks?. Planet formation is believed to occur within the first 10 million years of a stars life, when the star is surrounded by a significant mass of gas and dust. This makes the recent discovery of a class of actively accreting ~40 Myr old M dwarfs curious. The optical emission lines and strong infrared excess are hallmarks of gas-rich planet-forming disks, but the ages are more consistent with that of debris disks. Prior observations of these systems were only sensitive to warm gas and dust, and could not constrain the presence of a massive reservoir of cold gas and dust. With ALMA we can sensitively measure the mass of the cold reservoir, down to 0.01-0.03 Earth masses, determining if these systems are late-stage protoplaneary disks, or gas rich debris disks. If they are gas-rich debris disks, we can distinguish between models for the origin of the warm gas and dust, as either fed by a cold reservoir or generated by the collision of massive bodies close to the star, based on the detection or non-detection of a cold reservoir.',\n"," 'Zooming into molecular tori. In our previous ALMA proposals, we have detected for the first time with CO(6-5) the molecular torus of 10pc diameter in the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068 (Garcia-Burillo et al 2016). Surprisingly, the torus is tilted, warped, and its kinematics is dominated by turbulence and non-circular motions. We have very recently mapped the molecular tori in 7 other AGN targets, at 5-10pc resolution, and found a large variety of radii and masses. Two of them are very dense and reach towards the center. We propose now to resolve the morphology and dynamics of these 2 tori in CO(6-5) at ~2pc resolution, with 0.03 beam in Band 9, to explore their clumpy and turbulent structure, and also detect for the first time the dust emission of their torus. We will then be able to understand this key structure, for different radio power and star forming rates, and quantify the various evolutionary phases of fueling and feedback processes. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black hole (BH), we will be able to determine accurately its mass, for Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation (or M_BH-M_bulge relation) where the scatter is maximum.',\n"," 'What is the Origin and Subsequent Evolution of Starbursts at z~2?. We propose to obtain resolved CO maps (0.2\" resolution, corresponding to ~1.5 kpc at the redshift of our sample) for 16 extremely luminous dusty star forming galaxies (log(L_IR/L_sun)) > 12.5) at the peak epoch of star formation activity (2',\n"," 'Clarifying a Detection of the [CII]Line from a z=7.215 Lyα Emitting Galaxy. Probing ISM, dust, dynamics of galaxies to earlier Universe across epoch of reionization (EoR) at z>6 can reveal how galaxies formed and reionization progressed. [CII] is strongest ISM line in galaxies and traces star formation rate (SFR). Various z~0–6 galaxies follow a clear SFR–[CII] luminosity L(CII) correlation, but recent ALMA observations have failed to detect [CII] from z~6.5–7 EoR galaxies possibly due to insufficient depths. Their L(CII) limits are marginally consistent with the SFR–L(CII) correlation or lower. If lower, EoR galaxies have different ISM state than z<6 galaxies, implying drastic galaxy evolution across EoR. We observed a galaxy at even earlier epoch z=7.215 in Cycle 2 and found a 3σ signal consistent with [CII] line. If it is indeed [CII], it marginally follows the SFR–L(CII) correlation. If not, the lower L(CII) supports rapid galaxy evolution across EoR. To clarify this, we request 3h of DDT to deepen our data. The galaxy is also currently undetected in dust continuum. Deeper data will detect it or push the system to the realm of extremely dust-poor galaxies. Moreover, deeper data allow us to constrain dynamics of the galaxy and reionization state at z>7.',\n"," 'Why do isolated galaxies host red pseudobulges?. Despite the widespread idea that pseudobulges grow continuously via star formation, AMIGA sample of highly isolated galaxies is dominated by discs hosting red pseudobulges, consistent with an early formation epoch and scant subsequent growth. Only single dish studies of the molecular gas in isolated galaxies have been feasible so far, and those suggest it to be more extended than in denser environments, where gravitational torques/accretion from companions might play a dominant role in increasing SFE when compared to bars or gas accretion from the cosmic web. Although segregating the full range of environmental effects is crucial, most current studies mix galaxies residing in very different environments, and a reference sample where environmental effects are minimized is missing. We propose to map a sample of 18 very isolated galaxies in the CO(1-0) line with ALMA at 0.5\" resolution in order to investigate differences in molecular gas distribution/kinematics between: disc/pseudobulges, barred/non barred, and compare with samples in denser environments. Solely ALMA can both map the disc of a significant sample of isolated galaxies and resolve their small pseudobulges in ~ 6h.',\n"," 'Simultaneous Monitoring of Stellar Flares with ALMA and TESS to Discover Space Weather Environments of Exoplanets. The high energy emission from stellar flares calls into question the habitability of planets orbiting M-dwarf flare stars. While the recently-discovered population of millimeter flares closely traces this high energy emission, the relationship to the optical wavelengths at which flares are usually observed remains unclear. Here, we propose the first ALMA observations of M-dwarf flares alongside simultaneous optical monitoring at 20 sec cadence with TESS. The multi-wavelength observations will determine for the first time (1) if higher rates of millimeter flaring than optical flaring are typical of M-dwarf flare stars, informing the space weather environments of terrestrial planets. (2) The proposed observations will also quantify the degree of optical decoupling to millimeter flares for a select handful of large events observed simultaneously in both wavelengths.',\n"," 'Large-scale cold gas structure in protostellar envelopes. Stars form out of collapsing cold dense protostellar envelopes. Passively irradiated protostellar envelopes are surrounded by a substantial amount of cold gas. In these cold regions, CO freezes out on the grains and other molecules such as DCO+ are enhanced. The chemical differentiation allows us to target the enhanced molecular species to probe the CO dark infalling flows. Only ALMA with its high surface brightness sensitivity and correlator flexibility can deliver these lines. Our previous observations show that multiple tracers are needed to probe the entire infalling gas. Data in band 4 were previously obtained with 10 minutes of integration. Due to the lack of uv coverage, strong sidelobes are present at the regions of interest. A better uv coverage characterized by less than 20% sidelobes can be obtained with at least 3 hours of integration per source. Higher sensitivity and image quality allow for better quantification of the extent of the cold gas emission. These maps are needed to examine the flow of the gas into the inner envelope, disk, and protostar. The cold gas flow will give estimates on the pristine material entering the disk.',\n"," 'Resolving molecular gas in ultra-compact starburst galaxies with extreme outflows. We propose to observe four ultra-compact (r_e~100pc) late stage merger starburst galaxies at z~0.5 that exhibit high velocity (~1000km/s) outflows and no evidence for AGN. These galaxies are among the best examples showing that Eddington-limited star formation feedback can be competitive with AGN for shaping the star formation histories of massive spheroids. We recently obtained CO(2-1) detections of these four targets in ALMA Cycle 4, allowing us to show that the integrated star formation efficiencies (SFE) are already close to the upper limit predicted for radiation pressure feedback. Surprisingly, however, most of the systems show spatially resolved offsets in the CO emission, suggesting that a large fraction of the gas is *not* associated with the central starburst but with molecular outflows or remnant disks. Here we aim to re-observe the same targets at 0.25\" resolution to resolve these molecular structures ~1.5kpc scales, placing constraints on the (potentially extreme) SFE in the central nuclear starburst, and exploring the role of molecular gas in driving, and being driven by, central star formation.',\n"," 'Imaging Titans Troposphere. We propose to use ALMAs uniquely powerful combination of resolution and sensitivity to map the thermal emission emanating from Titans troposphere, in Bands 3, 4 and 6 at 100 mas resolution. These observations exploit a new way to measure the temperature field of the troposphere, and ALMA provides the only means to do so at high spatial resolution. In conjunction, we will submit a companion proposal for JVLA observations in A-configuration in Ka and Q bands at comparable resolution and sensitivity. The longer wavelengths are more sensitive to surface emission. By combining data from both programs, we will be able to remove the atmospheric contribution to the long wavelength images, resulting in high precision corrected surface brightness temperature maps with climatic and/or geologic implications. The combined ALMA/JVLA data will result in an unprecedented view of Titans surface and lower atmosphere.',\n"," 'The Third Leg of Galaxy Stellar Mass Assembly: A Census of CO in high-redshift cluster centrals. We are undertaking a multi-faceted study of the in-situ stellar mass growth of Brightest Cluster Galaxies through cosmic time. These systems are the most massive galaxies at any epoch and form at the dense centres of galaxy clusters. Once thought to be outliers, they are now recognized as sensitive probes of hierarchical structure formation processes such as gas cooling, galaxy merging and energy feedback mechanisms. Coupling the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey to the OzDES spectroscopic survey, we have assembled the largest sample of spectroscopically confirmed BCGs beyond z>0.3 to date. We are now engaged in an campaign to measure the three fundamental characteristics of galaxy mass assembly for these BCGs: the current stellar mass, the instantaneous star formation rate and,here, the total molecular gas mass available for new stars. This three-pronged approach will elucidate the growth of BCGs and provide constraints for models which currently struggle to reproduce their observed properties over time. The first two prongs of this study are in hand; we now request 15hrs in ALMA Cycle 7 to assemble the first census of molecular gas (CO(2-1)) in high-z BCGs.',\n"," 'Disentangling the molecular gas content in gas-rich galaxies at z ~ 0.15. In this proposal we search for \"local\" analogues of high-z galaxies. From our previous experiments, we have identified a handful of gas-rich galaxies, f_gas=MH2/(MH2+Mstar)>0.3 at z~0.1-0.2, which could be perfect laboratories to understand the star-forming physics seen in gas rich galaxies at z>1. One of the most striking differences between the nearby and the high-z star-formation activity is the presence of giant molecular clumps in gas-rich disk-galaxies which can be as 100-1000x more massive than those seen locally. Is it therefore imperative to understand (from more nearby objects) the dynamical processes that give birth to those high-z gas-rich and highly turbulent disks -- dominated by high surface brightness and velocity dispersions. As a follow-up campaign, in this proposal, we target three bright f_gas>0.3 galaxies to resolve at 0.6\" resolution (~kpc-scale rest-frame) the structure and the dynamics of these recently discovered galaxies at z~0.1-0.2. At the exquisite signal-to-noise provided by their nearby nature, we can put thight constraints on the internal properties of these galaxies, including Larsons relations for the different molecular gas regions.',\n"," 'Deep [OIII] 88 um and dust continuum observations of two remarkably luminous galaxies at z ~ 10. We propose [OIII] 88 um and dust continuum observations of two remarkably UV-luminous (MUV=-23) galaxies at z~10. Our targets are carefully selected from the brand-new COSMOS2020 catalogue equipped with deep and unprecedentedly-wide optical to near-infrared data, the best suitable to find the rarest, brightest galaxies. Our two candidates have 1) sharp Lyman break features; 2) IRAC detection; 3) tight photo-z solutions. The volume density of these objects is consistent with the bright-end of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) studies at z=9-10 that suggests a double power-law. We aim to identify these objects by [OIII] 88 um, the best FIR line to observe z>8 galaxies. This will be done with six tuning setups carefully chosen to cover mostly the entire photo-z range. A successful detection will confirm the power-law nature of the UVLF for the first time by spectroscopy. This has significant implication in the field of galaxy formation as they would represent a transition before significant dust attenuation and mass quenching. We will also directly observe the dust continuum, which is crucial to test the dust-poor hypothesis as the physical origins of the brightest galaxies.',\n"," 'How do GMCs start to form massive stars? An ALMA survey of young, massive star forming GMCs in the LMC. We have discovered six isolated GMCs in the Large Magellanic Cloud that do not show any sign of stellar feedback, yet contain embedded massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). These GMCs represent a unique sample of GMCs that have only recently begun to form massive stars. Our objective is to exploit ALMAs unique capabilities and the LMCs favorable orientation to determine the density substructure and the existence of dense clumps within these GMCs, and probe the initial conditions that have lead to the formation of massive stars. Given the widespread location of massive star formation in GMCs, we will use 13CO(1-0) to observe the entire GMCs instead of merely focusing on apparent hot spots of star formation. The exact location of MYSOs within GMCs will test theory, while the kinematics in the vicinity of MYSOs will probe how massive clumps form, acquire their mass, and start to form massive stars. CS(2-1) will constrain the timescale of dense gas removal around young massive stars/clusters. These observations fill a crucial gap bridging quiescent and more evolved massive star forming clouds, where the initial GMC configuration that led to the formation of massive stars is lost.',\n"," 'Spatially resolved observations of the 14N/15N isotopic ratio in Herbig disks. Isotopic ratios are often used to determine the formation history of the organic material in our solar system. Observations of the disk-integrated N fractionation ratios in 7 protoplanetary disks have found fractionation ratios between 80 and 200, very similar to cometary values (~100-250). However, only two disks have been observed at high enough angular resolution to resolve the fractionation profiles. Both disks have been around T Tauri stars. Disks around intermediate mass stars, Herbig Ae, present higher UV fluxes and disk temperatures, that could potentially affect the N fractionation patterns. We propose to spatially resolve (0.2) the 14N/15N ratio in HCN across two disks around Herbig Ae stars: MWC 480 and HD 163296. HC15N has already been detetected in both disks making them prime candidates for follow up observations, but only at 0.5 angular resolution. With the proposed observations we will be able to directly compare the N fractionation in disks around T Tauri and Herbig stars, and test current chemical models of nitrogen isotope fractionation.',\n"," 'Methanol Maser Polarization in Massive Star Forming Regions. Methanol masers provide unique information of very small and dense regions embedded in thick dust envelopes, but their polarization observations have been rare, partially because they were thought to be dominated by turbulence. Recently some polarization observations of the Class II methanol masers near the central object present evidences that the fields traced by masers are aligned and associated with the overall field morphologies of star forming cores, but not much is known for Class I methanol masers, which is known to trace regions shocked by outflows. We propose for the line polarimetric observation in one of the strongest Class I methanol maser 95GHz transition toward two star forming regions that are bright and have high fraction of linear polarization in the single-dish observations. This observation will help us to understand if the magnetic field morphology of the Class I methanol maser are randomly distributed or ordered like the Class II masers.',\n"," 'Mapping the Ionizing Photon Rates from Luminous Starburst Galaxies in the local Universe. Thermal (free-free) radio continuum emission, which dominates microwave bands between 30 - 100 GHz (~90% at 33 GHz), is unbiased by dust and directly related to the ionizing photon production from newly-formed massive stars. Here we propose for 12.7 hours (8.5 on-source) of Band-3 continuum observations of 12 luminous starburst galaxies in the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) at matched-resolution (~2\") to our 3 - 33 GHz VLA survey. With complete 3 - 100 GHz imaging we will accurately separate the synchrotron, thermal dust, and free-free emission components at 90 GHz, yielding some of the most precise measurements to date of the ionizing photon rates from extragalactic star-forming regions in starburst galaxies. These observations will be complemented by our MUSTANG-2 90 GHz campaign with the GBT to map 29 late-type galaxies in the Star Formation in Radio Survey (SFRS) with analogous 3 - 33 GHz imaging. Crucially, ALMA observations of the GOALS sample specifically target local, massive galaxies that are not contained in the SFRS, and whose resolved extra-nuclear SF regions have on average an order of magnitude higher SFR than those found in nearby normal galaxies.',\n"," 'Catch me if you can: time-variable ionization of DQ Tau disk traced via H13CO+. T Tauri stars are active at many different wavelengths, including X-rays. The result of this activity is a variable ionization of the disks molecular layers, but how this variability affects the disk is not yet clear. By observing a molecule like H13CO+, which is sensitive to gas-phase ion chemistry in the disk, we can gain a new window on the variable ionization in disks. Such observations require a unique model system, where the ionizing flux increases predictably. Here, we propose observations of H13CO+ spanning 8 nights of the eccentric, compact binary DQ Tau (P=15.8 days). This source is unique for its highly predictable brightening in X-ray and UV wavelengths near periastron. It has a disk representative of other (single) T Tauri stars. By combining our observations with a physical-chemical model tailored to the DQ Tau system and its activity, we will perform the first systematic study of how ionization in a protoplanetary disk, and its impact on gas-phase chemistry, change as a function of time in response to stellar activity.',\n"," 'Deuteration in warm dense gas regions. Deuterated chemistry is an important tool in star formation, still not fully understood. In particular the deuterium fractionation (Dfrac) in warm dense regions such as photon-dominated regions (PDRs). We have developed chemical models to explain the deuteration level in such regions and tested them with observations in the star-forming region MonR2. The chemical model was able to reproduce the observed Dfrac assuming that deuteration occurs via gas-phase reactions. Moreover, it revealed that Dfrac of some species can be used as a chemical clock. Our previous observational studies lacked information on the spatial distribution, and recent observations have shown hints of a possible Dfrac spatial gradient. This suggests different deuteration processes in PDRs depending on the chemical/physical properties. In this proposal we aim to perform a spatial study of Dfrac in multiple molecular species towards two nearby PDRs: MonR2 and GGD14 (a presumably younger PDR, located at the same distance of MonR2). This will allow us to better understand the processes leading the deuteration in warm dense regions and will provide better observational constraints for the chemical models.',\n"," 'Cold accretion in silhouette - exploring the properties of the very deep absorption in Hydra-A. We propose observations of an extraordinarily deep absorption line in the classic, double-lobed radio galaxy Hydra-A that we discovered in Cycle 4. We find a narrow (<5km/s), deep (tau=1.0) CO(1-2) absorption that is slightly redshifted (+20 km/s) from the BCG systemic velocity with several weaker, broader lines at larger velocity offset. This very deep absorption allows us to search for a number of isotoplogues of CO and other high density tracers such as HCN and HCO+ with a very large potential dynamic range given the bright core (70-130mJy over Bands 3 to 6). Obtaining a census of the standard molecular tracers will allow a new insight into the chemistry of cold gas in cluster cores in general and allow us to constrain their physical properties (density, temperature, size) and link the apparent C, N, O and S ratios to their enrichment from the intracluster medium and/or stellar mass loss from the BCG. The balance of the absorption in this system being \"deep, but not too deep\" allows lines with an optical depth 25-50 times lower to be detected while avoiding the complications of line saturation, making this object unique in the local Universe.',\n"," 'Polarimetric observations of a complete sample of radio sources.

At high redshifts, giant Ly-alpha nebulae play a crucial role in the evolution of massive galaxies, but their link to stellar growth critically depends on the properties of the coldest, molecular gas phase. ALMA observations of CO(4-3) in Cycle-7 and 8 revealed extended (~100 kpc) reservoir of cold molecular gas in a sample of four Ly-alpha nebule at z=2.22~2.31. We propose ACA observations of simultaneously CO(7-6) and CI(2-1), which will complement existing ALMA and VLA data of CO(4-3), CI(1-0), and CO(1-0). This suite of molecular tracers will allow us to study the physical properties of the cold gas (e.g., mass, temperature, excitation conditions, and radiation field) simultaneously across different environments (QSO host, CO/[CI] emitters, molecular outflow, and molecular CGM). This will allow us to investigate the cold baryon cycle that drives the early evolution of these massive galaxies at cosmic noon.',\n"," '(How) do low-luminosity radio AGN affect star formation in their host galaxies?. Leading models of galaxy evolution postulate that AGN may regulate star formation in galaxies by injecting a fraction of their energy output into the surrounding gas, thereby inhibiting star formation over long times. However, a direct link between AGN activity and a suppression of star formation is very difficult to come by. We will observe CO(1-0) in 8 nearby Seyfert galaxies with kpc-scale radio emission indicating that radio plasma from the AGN percolates through their ISM to kpc distances. Recent hydrodynamic simulations suggest that this plasma could enhance local gas turbulence and lower star formation rates, when adopting the framework of turbulence-regulated star formation that is now widely accepted in the ISM community. This is part of a multi-wavelength project including optical IFU spectroscopy. We will map the local gas velocities and line widths and compare with warm ionized gas, star formation, and stellar populations observed in the optical to trace the distribution of AGN energy in the ISM and its impact on star formation. We are also carrying out dedicated, matched relativistic hydrodynamic simulations for a quantitative interpretation of our results.',\n"," 'Chasing streamers: Unveiling the connection between disk growth and infall channels in embedded protostars. The recent rise in the discovery of streamers, asymmetric channels of infall toward the protostellar disk, show that the local environment around protostars influences their evolution beyond their main accretion phase. In particular, the presence of streamers towards embedded protostars suggests that the total mass within disks is replenished and possibly increases, right at a critical evolutionary stage to kickstart planet formation. However, there are not enough protostars with their envelopes characterized to evaluate the influence of streamers in the mass accretion process. We propose a systematic search for streamers towards near-by star-forming regions, including Perseus and Orion, to determine if the presence of streamers correlates with high accretion rates. We build a sample of 43 protostars, out of which we request ALMA 12m and ACA observations of 32 of them, to derive statistically significant correlations. We will determine if the presence of streamers correlates with high accretion rates (>10^-7 Msun/yr) towards protostars, and quantify the effects of streamers on protostellar disks growth.',\n"," 'An unbiased census of giant molecular clouds in the low-metal dwarf galaxy NGC 6822. We propose to obtain a CO(1-0) map of the central 12 x 15 (1.7 kpc x 2.1 kpc) region of the low-metal dwarf galaxy NGC 6822 with a resolution of 11 (25 pc), in order to build an unbiased catalog of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). The proposed depth is sufficiently deep to detect a molecular gas mass of ~9 x 10^4 M_sun even for an estimated CO-to-H2 conversion factor in NGC 6822, which is 50x larger than the Galactic value. The CO(1-0) map properties, i.e., angular resolution and gas-mass sensitivity, will be almost compatible to the existing wide-area CO(1-0) images of local well-studied galaxies including LMC (Nanten), M51 (PAWS), and M83 (ALMA), allowing us to make a direct comparison of GMC properties among these different types of galaxies. Our science goals are (1) Conducting a systematic search for non-star-forming massive GMCs, which is known to be significant in LMC/SMC, (2) Measuring GMC-YSO separations to assess the timescales for the association of GMCs with star formation, and (3) constraining the column density probability distribution functions to test if any external compression exists.',\n"," 'Characterization of highly excited gas in the most distant submillimeter galaxy. We propose to conduct 0.4arcsec-resolution observations of the CO(12-11) and CO(11-10) emission lines in SPT0311-58 at z=6.900, which is the highest redshift SMG. These two lines can be simultaneously observed with a single frequency setup, doubling the efficiency of observations. The CO(6-5), CO(7-6), and CO(10-9) emission lines are detected in previous ALMA observations. Combining the proposed observations with the previous ones, we will investigate the CO spectral line energy distributions (SLED) of highly excited gas in the central 1 kpc region of the SMG at z=7. If we find the CO SLED is similar to that of the nearest quasar, Mrk231, it would be a signature of dust-obscured quasars at z=7, which have not been discovered yet. In obscured quasars, black holes grow faster than an unobscured phase. Therefore, the detailed study of the CO SLED in a SMG at z=7 would provide new insights into our understanding of the early growth of supermassive black holes.',\n"," 'How does environment impact the origin of stellar masses? A census of protostellar distributions in the CMZ. The assumption of a universal Initial Mass Function (IMF) underpins many key measurements in modern astrophysics. Surveying complete stellar populations to measure the IMF across environments in our Galaxy is complicated by variable extinction and shearing that destroys young clusters, particularly toward our most extreme local environment, the Galactic centre. The precursor to the IMF, the prestellar Core Mass Function (CMF), can be measured in both the Galactic disk and centre in the same way, allowing an apples-to-apples comparison. Such a comparison is necessary to test for CMF variation over statistically significant samples. We propose a large-scale survey of cores in the Galactic centre, designed to match the frequency, physical resolution, and continuum sensitivity of two accepted ALMA large programs studying the CMF in the Galactic disk. These data will enable a statistically significant, direct comparison of the CMF in the Galactic disk and the extreme Galactic centre. We aim to constrain what role environment plays in the construction of the CMF, and ultimately the origin of the IMF.',\n"," 'V* V1094 Sco: optically thin continuum observations for a rare giant multi-ringed disk. A key ALMA discovery is the unexpectedly wide variety of structures in protoplanetary disks. We recently serendipitously discovered a new, huge (dust outer radius of 300 AU) multi-ringed disk around V1094 Sco in ALMA Band 6 and 7 data. Recent VLT-SPHERE/IRDIS scattered-light and higher-resolution ALMA images also show rings and substructure in this disk, down to even smaller scales. Disks the size of V1094 Sco are rare; it is in the top 2% of Lupus disks by radius. With structure at many scales, and evidence for a radially varying spectral index, V1094 Sco can be a key probe of dust ring formation mechanisms. However, a key observable is missing: in Band 6, the inner 35 AU are optically thick, and the interpretation of the spectral index of the dust is ambiguous due to low spectral leverage. This prevents us from analyzing dust structure and grain growth in this crucial area. We propose ALMA observations in Band 3 at 0.057\" resolution, imaging the dust in the center of this key object with an optically thin tracer for the first time. Our proposal combines VLT-SPHERE and ALMA observers to study the origin of multiple rings in disks.',\n"," 'Understanding the Physical Origin of [CII] Deficit in Early Star-Forming Galaxies. The ionising output of early star-forming galaxies is key to understanding their role in cosmic reionisation. We have undertaken a detailed survey of a large sample of z=3 Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) whose intense [OIII] 5007A emission indicates they are useful analogues of galaxies in the reionisation era at z>6. A now completed deep HST F336W imaging campaign finds a surprisingly high fraction show prominent Lyman continuum leakage with escape fractions ranging from 13 to 60%. Our photoionisation models indicate such high escape fractions may arise from star-forming regions that are density- (rather than radiation-) bound, consistent also with the high [OIII] to [OII] line ratios. Such star-forming regions may also explain the puzzling ``[CII] 158um deficit seen in several high redshift galaxies given that line partly originates from photo-dissociation regions. We request time to study [CII] emission in a representative subset of our LAEs to examine the correlation between our individually-measured escape fractions and the strength of [CII] and hence to test the density-bound hypothesis.',\n"," 'Formation of Large Carbon-Based Molecules in the Red Rectangle. The Red Rectangle is a remarkable pre-planetary nebula. Centered on a binary system, it consists of a dust and molecule-rich equatorial disk, irradiated by strong UV photons, and a X-shaped axisymmetric structure, tracing the bipolar outflow and shaping the nebula in its characteristic rectangular shape. Besides its morphology, the Red Rectangle is best known for the richness of its spectra in the optical and IR. In particular, it displays bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, and series of prominent emission bands from 5000 to 7000 Å with wavelengths and profiles that closely correspond to four Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs). We here propose to probe the chemistry of the Red Rectangle by taking advantage of the sensitivity and spatial resolution of ALMA. The main goal is to obtain a census of the molecular complexity in this source by tracing the small-scale chemical variations from the central regions to the outflow. By comparing molecular variations in the Red Rectangle with the distribution of the PAHs and the DIBs, the observations will constrain the conditions in which the complex carbon-rich molecules that carry the DIBs and the PAHs are formed.',\n"," 'Interstellar Medium of a million solar low mass, low metallicity (6% solar) star-forming dwarf galaxy at z=1.847. We propose for ALMA CII and dust continuum observations of a redshift 1.847 lensed starformating galaxy with an intrinsic stellar mass of million solar masses, a star-formation rate of 2-8 solar masses per year and six percent solar nebular metal abundance. While it appears as a LIRG due to magnification by a factor of 40, its intrinsic luminosity is that of a sub-LIRG at the level of 1e10 solar lumunosities. As an initial step in understanding the ISM, we propose to connect the rest-frame far-IR observations to the optical/near-infrared propertie determined extensively with Hubble and ground-based facilities. The immediate goals are: (a) Detect spatially resolved CII and dust emission (at 50pc spatial resolution); (b) Use CII/LFIR to confirm whether this galaxy is similar to low-redshift dwarf galaxies or star-forming galaxies during reionization; (c) use resolved CII velocity structure to constrain the dynamical mass;(d) use stellar mass from SED models and CII to estimate gas mass fraction; and (e) study spatial variations in dust emission and CII, as well as CII/LFIR, as a function of the UV slope, OIII equivalent width, and nebular line intensities.',\n"," 'Detailed Physical Properties of the Interstellar Medium in a z=5.2 Dusty Starburst (Completion). Studies of the interstellar medium (ISM) at high redshift have progressed tremendously in the past years, but studies of the physical properties based on a suite of fine structure lines (which are critical for studying the earliest cosmic epochs, where CO is faint due to decreasing metallicity) are still in their beginning stages. We here propose to complete an in-depth study of the ISM based on six CNO fine structure lines in a massive starburst galaxy at redshift 5.2 (where all lines fall into a \"sweet spot\" in the atmosphere), allowing us to push these studies back to the first billion years of cosmic time. This will allow us to measure the fraction of [CII] emission that originated from the neutral vs. ionized medium, the density of both the neutral and ionized medium, the effective temperature in HII regions associated with star-forming clouds, and the O/N abundance ratio. This study will detect fine structure lines up to rest-frame wavelengths of 52 micron in one of the most distant starburst galaxies known, making it an ideal demonstration case for the ALMA band-10 receivers.',\n"," 'Measuring molecular gas reservoirs in post-starburst galaxies during the peak quenching era. We propose to quantify the molecular gas reservoirs in five post-starburst galaxies at z~1.4, during the peak era of galaxy quenching. We previously detected large molecular gas reservoirs, with masses ranging from 7x10^9-5x10^10 Msun, in six massive post-starburst galaxies at z~0.65. These intermediate-redshift galaxies probed the tail of this cosmic shut-down. Here, we propose to push this work to z~1.4 and assess whether post-starburst galaxies at the peak era of quenching also retain large molecular gas reservoirs. These observations will place direct constraints on the mechanism responsible for the truncation of star formation in typical massive galaxies. We propose to observe CO(2-1) in five post-starburst galaxies at z~1.4 with ALMA band 3. All galaxies have accurate redshifts and star formation rates from deep continuum spectroscopy, as well as sizes from HST. Using these datasets, we will place the galaxies on the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and study how molecular gas fractions correlate with time since the burst. Furthermore, we will compare our observations with cosmological simulations to assess the different proposed mechanisms to suppress star formation in galaxies.',\n"," 'Feedback from Supernova Remnant on Molecular Clouds: A detailed Study of the Shocked Gas in IC443.. Supernova remnants (SNRs) play a major role in regulating the star formation efficiency and evolution of galaxies. They locally enhance the density of the gas and inject vast amounts of energy and momentum that disturb and disperse their surrounding environment. However, it remains uncertain to what extent molecular clouds and their star formation activity are affected by SNRs, a key aspect in galaxy evolution models. Here, we propose to use ~2 hours of ALMA and ~20 hours of ACA+TP observing time to investigate the ongoing shock interaction between the SNR IC443 and an associated molecular clump (clump G). We propose to map the SiO(2-1) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in Band 3, to investigate the morphology and kinematics of the shocked and dense gas and to constrain the energy and momentum imprinted by the SNR IC443 on clump G. We will also obtain high-angular resolution 3mm continuum map that we will use to investigate the effect of the SN feedback on the star formation activity of the clump.',\n"," 'Tracing Signatures of Infall onto Uranus. The proposed observations explore the connection of Uranus atmosphere with its interior and environment. With ALMA Band 7, we will simultaneously measure the CO (3-2) and HCN (4-3) rotation lines at a spatial resolution of 0.28\" and a sensitivity of 200mK. The CO vertical profile, derived from the observed line shape, will improve constraints on CO infall from the Uranian environment and tighten limits on the abundance of CO uplifted from the warm planetary interior. The latter is tied to bulk oxygen abundance, thereby revealing information about the formation of Uranus, and of ice giants more generally. We will also improve the detection limit of HCN by a factor of 10, and spatially map Uranus in both CO and HCN in order to test whether these gases are the product of comet impacts, or point to other candidate infall sources. Our observations will improve our understanding of impacts throughout the outer Solar System, which is likely underestimated from satellite cratering counts; and inform models of Solar System formation and evolution.',\n"," 'The ALMA view of the Proxima c planet candidate. The aim of this proposal is to obtain a second epoch ALMA image of Proxima Cen to confirm or refute the reality of a secondary 1.3mm source, displaced 1.2 arcsec (1.5 au at 1.3 pc) from the star. Among several other possibilities, it was noted that its flux density was consistent with that of a Saturn-like planetary ring system, and thus, that it could be tracing a yet unknown planet orbiting Proxima Cen. Now, independent evidence for a second planet, Proxima c, has been gathered. Radial velocities suggest a planet orbiting at 1.5 au, the same distance obtained from the ALMA image, and very recent VLT imaging suggests the presence of an optical/near-IR orbiting source coincident with the ALMA source. Given the large proper motion of the star Proxima Cen (4 arcsec/yr), and the orbital period of the planet (about 5.5 yr) the proposed second epoch ALMA observations will easily discriminate between a fake source, an unrelated background object, and material associated with planet Proxima c that is orbiting the star.',\n"," 'Observing Exceptionally Bright Galaxies at z~6.6 in [CII] and Dust Continuum. We found 2 exceptionally bright Lya emitter (LAE) candidates at reionization epoch z~6.6, VIKING-z66LAB and VIKING-z66LAE-1, in our wide-field narrowband survey. They have remarkable Lya luminosities 3.4-3.9 x 10^43 erg/s and rest-frame Lya equivalent widths EW ~ 163A and >755A; these are comparable to or even greater than the brightest z~6.6 LAEs known such as Himiko and CR7. VIKING-z66LAB is also an extended Lya blob with >~3\" (15 kpc) size in Lya emission, comparable to sizes of Himiko and CR7. Himiko and CR7 are known as triple merger systems, and CR7 exhibits strong HeII 1640A emission, no metal lines and a PopIII-like stellar population. Thus VIKING-z66LAB may also be a rare multiple merger system with PopIII stars. VIKING-z66LAE-1 (1.8\" size in Lya) may also be a single galaxy (or closely interacting ones) with PopIII due to its extremely high Lya EW. We propose to observe them in [CII] and dust continuum to measure the enrichment of the ISM. If [CII]/dust is detected, they are not PopIII hosts but still extreme LAEs. We will compare their kinematics, dynamics, ISM, dust properties to those of normal galaxies and constrain z~6.6 reionization state from their [CII] and Lya.',\n"," 'Formation of VLM stars and BD in Lambda Orionis Star Forming Region (LOSFR). ACA view of LDN1589. Several projects have been conducted to search for pre- and proto-BDs in the Lambda Orionis Star Forming Region (LOSFR) to study key aspects of stellar and substellar formation. One of its dark clouds, B30, has been observed from optical to radio and their substellar objects have been studied. ALMA Band 7 data allowed to detect 3 pre-BDs candidates. Based on this, we focus on the present proposal on one of the youngest dark clouds of the LOSFR, LND1589, for which we have archival data from the optical to the mid-infrared, and submm data taken at 870um using APEX/LABOCA. We propose ACA Band 6 observations (along with an on-going APEX/ArTeMiS project) to: i) obtain spectral index information on sources detected in multiple projects to study grain growth and estimate their masses, ii) improve the selection function to identify candidates to be followed up with the 12m array, iii) build complete SEDs and estimate their Lbol and Tbol to derive their evolutionary stage, iv) model the radial profiles of the cores and compare them with those of low-mass stars, v) build a larger poll of pre/proto-substellar objects to put strong constraints on their proposed formation mechanisms.',\n"," 'A Survey of Infall in the Very Early Stages of High-Mass Star Formation. Recent ALMA surveys of massive 70 µm dark clumps yield hundreds of low-to-intermediate mass cores (and no high-mass prestellar cores), despite these clumps having the capability to form high-mass stars. Such findings lead to the conclusion that some of the detected cores must accumulate a significant amount of mass to become sufficiently massive to form high-mass stars, favoring clump-fed star formation scenarios. However, no characterization of infall rates has been systematically carried out to confirm if the high infall rates, of the order of 10E-3 - 10E-4 Msun/yr, are possible and if they are a common feature of cores at the earliest stages of high-mass star formation. In this proposal, we aim to determine what is the contribution of accretion on the line of sight and along filaments connected to cores. We have selected the ~40 most massive, sub-virialized cores among ~800 cores that are likely under collapse. Observing HCO+ J=3-2 and N2H+ J=1-0, we will derive infall rates (radial and/or along filaments) to evaluate whether these cores can accrete sufficient material to become massive and form high-mass stars in the future.',\n"," 'Probing spatially resolved winds in powerful starbursts at high redshift with Hydrogen Fluoride. Galaxy evolution is driven by the balance between gas inflows through accretion streams and mergers, the efficiency of star formation, and AGN and starburst driven outflows. Outflows play a key role in the gas cycle of galaxies by regulating star formation and polluting the CGM and IGM with mass, energy, and metals. The physical characteristics of outflows -- their mass loading and energy and momentum outflow rates are difficult to determine. The most powerful diagnostic lines of outflows should be observed in absorption to remove the directional ambiguity and provide robust estimates of the terminal velocity, be the dominate species for its primary element, and probe a wide range of column densities. The HF molecule fits all of these criteria (uniquely) well. To estimate the parameters of spatially-resolved molecular outflows, we propose to observe a sample of highly lenses SPT sources at z=3.7-4.3 in HF J=1-0, 2 water lines, and CO(10-9) in band 6. These observations will provide deep insights into the spatially-resolved characteristics of outflows and perhaps constrain the energy dissipated in the dense molecular gas through shocks with the water lines and a high J CO line.',\n"," 'Gas temperature and kinematics as key inputs for star formation theory: Cores and turbulence in the massive protocluster W51. We propose to image the temperature and velocity structure and measure the upper end of the core mass function within a massive cluster forming cloud, W51. We will use the p-H2CO lines at 218 GHz to map the gas temperature and 1.3 mm dust continuum emission to map the cores. The CO 2-1 line will be used to firmly identify the accreting cores by their outflows. These observations will be the first parsec-scale, high-resolution temperature maps of a forming massive cluster and will include the first measurement of the high-mass end of the core mass function in a region where it is expected to be fully sampled. The selection of p-H2CO as the thermometer is essential for determining the effect of gas temperature on star formation as it avoids a chemical bias towards already-fragmented gas that affects other gas thermometers. This project will provide a test of current star formation theories. We will measure the theoretical inputs to these theories, in particular the local Mach number and the gas temperature distribution, and the as-yet unconstrained high-mass end of the core mass function.',\n"," 'Uncovering the Molecular Gas Content of FRB Host Galaxies. Over the past 2 years, the fast radio burst (FRB) community has precisely localized ~10 events to their host galaxies. This affords a terrific opportunity to constrain the unknown origin(s) of these enigmatic signals through analysis of their stellar populations and high-resolution studies of their local environments. Optical and near-IR observations have now assessed the stellar components, including estimates of star formation rates and stellar masses. These reveal a diverse population of primarily star-forming galaxies favoring progenitor scenarios linked to more massive stars. Here, we propose to use ALMA to provide direct measurements of the cold gas present in FRB hosts via the CO J=3-2 emission-line. We will target six new hosts accessible with ALMA to survey their molecular gas masses and infer their star formation efficiencies. These results will be compared to the locus of normal, star-forming galaxies at low-z and the hosts of other transient populations (e.g. supernovae) to derive unique constraints on FRB progenitors. Last, these data will enable future programs to map CO at much higher spatial resolution and thereby dissect the very local environments of FRBs.',\n"," 'Searching for cold molecular gas in a massive, recently quenched galaxy at z=3. Understanding how supermassive black holes (SMBH) quench their host galaxies is a central problem in extragalactic astrophysics. The proposed physical mechanisms fall in two classes: ejective and preventative feedback. The first removes the gas from the disc, interrupting star formation; the second stops the inflow of cold gas, so star formation continues until the gas in the disc is used up. Investigating the gas content of old quiescent galaxies cannot disentangle these mechanisms, because too much time has passed between quenching and the time of observation. JWST enables us to measure the quenching time of newly quiescent galaxies with a precision of 10s of Myr. We propose to measure the molecular-to-stellar mass ratio of GS-10578, by observing CO(3-2) in Band 3 for 10.9h. We will also measure the SFR on timescales of 100s Myr by observing the cold-dust continuum in Band 7 for 1.3h. GS-10578 is a massive galaxy at z=3 which became quiescent only 30 Myr prior to observation. This system represents the most recently quenched massive galaxy known, so it represents our best opportunity to investigate SMBH feedback free from the confounding effects of evolution after quiescence.',\n"," 'The new radial velocity planet in CI Tau: an ALMA search for sibling planets at radii > 4 A.U.. We propose high resolution continuum imaging of the disc of the T Tauri star CI Tau which has recently been shown to host an eccentric hot Jupiter at an orbital radius of $\\\\sim 0.1$ A.U.. A primary motivation is to discover whether this planet has sibling planets at larger radial distances (as is often the case for hot Jupiters around main sequence stars) which may have played a role in deflecting the hot Jupiter into its present orbit. We show that we will easily be able to recover evidence of gaps in the disc produced by massive planets at orbital radii $> 4$ A.U.. Our secondary science goal, in the absence of detected structure, is to improve the estimate of the surface density of the inner disc. Our team combines experience in the analysis of mm observations with members of the discovery team of the hot Jupiter in CI Tau together with a number of theorists experienced in modeling various aspects of disc dynamics and planet-disc interaction. This places us in a strong position to interpret our results in terms of the likely dynamical history of the CI Tau disc/planet system.',\n"," 'The ISM of the most luminous starbursts in the early Universe. Using the H-ATLAS survey we have discovered the two most luminous starbursts in the early Universe: SGP38326 at z_spec=4.425 and UR56917 at z_spec=4.420. None of them is lensed according to high-resolution dust and [CII] imaging. Their star formation rates (SFR~4500Mo/yr) and gas depletion times (a few Myrs) means that they are the likely progenitors of the most massive ellipticals at z~3. Here we propose to observe their [CI], high-J CO and water lines which, in combination with the available low-J CO, [CII] and [NII] will give a detailed view of all gas phases of their ISM. The proposed observations will help us understand massive star formation in the early Universe and the birth of the galaxy red sequence.',\n"," 'The Molecular Gas Content in the NGC 5044 Group. The NGC 5044 group is the best candidate for studying star formation in an AGN-perturbed cooling flow due to its proximity and extensive multi-frequency coverage. Our ALMA cycle 0 observation of N5044 in CO(2-1) detected 24 molecular structures. Based on the molecular masses and CO linewidths, these structures are probably giant molecular associations and not individual GMCs. In cycle 4, we successfully proposed for higher spatial resolution observations with the primary goal of resolving these structures into individual GMCs and obtaining the first statistical sample of GMCs that condensed out of a cooling flow. While our previous ALMA observations have been very informative regarding the properties of compact molecular structures in cooling flows, the majority of the molecular gas (~70%), as measured by an IRAM 30m obervation, remains unaccounted for in the ALMA 12m array data. For this cycle, we propose a 7m array observation in CO(2-1) to probe the more extended and diffuse component of molecular gas. The distribution and kinematics of this dominant molecular component is essential for a full understanding of the formation of molecular gas in cooling flows.',\n"," 'Monitoring PKS1830-211: the submm activity of the blazar and the variability of the foreground absorption lines. To better understand the launching mechanism of the jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN), we need information from the region close to its physical base, where the plasma acceleration takes place. This region is opaque in the radio but becomes gradually optically thin at submm wavelengths. We propose to monitor the submm activity of the lensed AGN PKS1830-211 over a period of five months by studying the variation of the flux ratio R between its two lensed images. R is a relative quantity that can be measured at extreme precision with ALMA (down to a few 0.1%) and free of instrumental and calibration uncertainties. A monitoring of PKS1830-211 will thus reveal the (even marginal) submm activity of the blazar at a completely unexplored sensitivity regime. In the same time, we will also monitor the variations of the absorption lines arising in the lens galaxy. These variations carry information on (micro-)changes in the morphology of the background continuum illumination and will provide information on the nature of the absorbing gas.',\n"," 'Probing B-Fields in the Accretion Streams Feeding VLA1623 Protostellar Disk Through 13CO Polarization Observations.

We are currently undertaking a comprehensive study of the circumnuclear regions (CNRs) of the most luminous local (D<40 Mpc) southern AGN, selected from the SWIFT/BAT survey. Our AO-assisted VLT/SINFONI, deep XShooter IFU spectroscopy, and HST imaging provide a wealth of information about the inner 3\" of these AGN. A crucial element of our large program is the observations of a carefully matched control sample on the same spatial scales, to distinguish between long-lived dynamical processes vs. rapid ones synchronised with the bright AGN event. Large beam single-dish observations in CO(2-1) do not find any substantial difference between our AGN and inactive galaxies. This suggests that the direct link between cold gas and nuclear inflow must be found on the scales of the CNR. Here we propose to observe the remaining 21 galaxies in our sample lacking adequate archival data in Band 6 to map CO(2-1) with 0.4\" resolution over 5\" scales, complementing the multi-phase tracers from our SINFONI and HST data. This will allow an unprecedented comparative study of the inflow of cold gas in the circumnuclear environment, as well as reveal the link between cold gas and feedback from the AGN.',\n"," 'The Crab nebula at 100GHz: filling in the gap. We propose to carry out the first high-resolution continuum imaging of the central region of the Crab nebula at mm wavelengths. These observations will complement our ongoing campaign to study the Crab PWN with Chandra, HST, and EVLA. Our science goal is to understand the physical processes responsible for the formation of the PWN features, uncover the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the injected particles and its evolution across the nebula. Additionally, we will shed light on the origin of the flares observed in the high-energy (gamma-rays) PWN flux. The proposed observations will provide the first image of the Crab nebula in the 100 GHz window with an angular resolution of about 1 arcsec. The Crab is an iconic object, and the high-resolution, high-quality image at millimeter wavelengths will certainly have a long-lasting scientific impact and legacy value.

The photon ring around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in M87 has been imaged with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), and results on SgrA* are in the pipeline. With ALMA passive-phasing, the EHT can now detect sources of a few 10s of mJy. Additional SMBH photon rings are likely resolvable by the EHT, but these SMBHs are faint at centimeter radio (weak/no jets), and their 230 GHz flux (accretion inflow) is unknown. We propose to measure the 230 GHz flux of 23 SMBHs with photon ring > 5 microarcsec (piggy-backing 77 more SMBHs with photon ring > 2 microarcsec). i.e., a total of 100 large ring SMBHs. Those with nuclear flux > 10mJy will be followed up with the 12m array, VLBA, and eventually the best with EHT. Our longer term goals are to identify all SMBHs in which the EHT can resolve the photon ring and jet base, and to drive the technical requirements of the next-generation-EHT. Even only a few new EHT-feasible large ring galaxies will allow the transformational results in M87 and SgrA* to be leveraged to a larger number of galaxies.

The onset of star formation in super star clusters (SSCs) is expected to have a strong impact on the molecular line emission from their natal clouds. Previous studies have shown that changes in the line ratios of dense gas tracers HCN and HCO+ have the potential to track the evolutionary progress of molecular clouds as they begin to form SSCs. To test this potentially valuable diagnostic trend, we need to see if it is replicated in a variety of environments. The overlap region of the merging Antennae galaxies has a significant population of young SSCs at various stages of evolution, including the only confirmed candidate proto-SSC that has not yet begun star formation. This makes the Antennae one of the most promising regions to probe the evolution of the dense gas at these very early stages of SSC formation. The observations proposed here will improve our understanding of the behavior of the dense gas, give insights into the mechanisms by which SSCs form, and calibrate an observational diagnostic tool for future young-SSC studies.',\n"," 'First Thermal Imaging of Triton. Triton, the largest known KBO-type body in our solar system, represents (with Pluto) a potentially ubiquitous class of worlds with nitrogen atmospheres controlled by volatile transport, sublimation and condensation, and are therefore strongly coupled to surface temperature. We propose observations of Tritons 350 GHz thermal continuum emission at 28 mas resolution and 0.4 K sensitivity (Band 7, C-8 configuration). Using three well calibrated visits, separated by ~120° longitude, we will (a) accurately measure the disk average brightness temperature, allowing older archival data, including spectral lines of CO and HCN, to be more accurately analyzed, and allowing comparison to and contrast with Pluto, and (b) map variations in thermal emission predicted by new volatile transport modeling, with ~16 independent beams across the disk for each visit. The sensitivity and resolution that only ALMA can achieve will provide high fidelity images of Tritons thermal emission, placing strong constraints on the distribution of ices on the surface, and in turn constraining volatile transport and evolution models of Triton, and more generally icy worlds with nitrogen dominated surfaces.',\n"," 'Unveiling molecular gas in local Herschel-ATLAS galaxies. We wish to perform spatially resolved observations of the [CI] line in Band 8 and the CO(1-0) line in Band 3 for a sample of nearby (z~0.07) galaxies detected by Herschel to obtain two separate measures of their molecular gas masses. The [CI] line will allow us to trace the full extent of the H2 gas, velocity field, and enclosed dynamical mass. This will be compared to the well known ``traditional tracer CO(1-0) with which we will trace the H2 mass via the XCO conversion factor. We obtained Cycle 2 CO(1-0) data on a set of targets from the H-ATLAS GAMA 09-hr field, all of which were significantly detected. The crucial part of the project -- the [CI] data -- was, sadly, not observed in Cycles 2, 3 or 4, though we had highly ranked approved programs. It is no longer possible to pursue the sample of 09-hr sources in Band 8 since they will be observable only during the daytime. To overcome this, the subject of this Cycle 5 proposal is to obtain a complete set of [CI](1-0) and CO(1-0) data for a sample of galaxies from the H-ATLAS GAMA 14-hr field that will finally allow us to achieve our science goals.',\n"," 'Mapping the Molecular Gas in NGC 5813. We propose to map the molecular gas and its dynamics through CO(2-1) line flux measurements in the core of the galaxy group NGC 5813, with an angular resolution of 1.5\". This group shows a unique X-ray morphology, with three pairs of collinear cavities, each pair associated with an elliptical cocoon outburst shock, from three distinct outbursts of the central AGN. It is therefore extremely well suited to the study of AGN feedback and the outburst history of the AGN. By comparing the proposed ALMA observations with our very deep Chandra observations we will trace the cooling gas over six orders of magnitude in temperature, from the X-ray, to the H-alpha emitting, to the molecular phase on arcseond scales. By determining the dynamics of the molecular gas, we will also compare hot gas versus cold gas fueling rates for the central AGN, which in turn can be compared with the long term AGN power output thanks to the unique X-ray morphology of this system. Finally, from the dynamics of the molecular gas we will evaluate whether the gas is pushed out along with the X-ray gas by the expanding cavities, lifted by/infalls along the H-alpha filaments, or both.',\n"," 'Towards an evolutionary sequence of molecular gas in young debris disks: the hybrid disk candidate HD131835. Most young stars harbor circumstellar disks which evolve from gas-dominated primordial disks to debris dust disks in about 10 Myr. In ALMA Cycle 0, our group discovered a disk around the 30-Myr-old HD21997 that links the primordial and the debris phases. The CO lines detected in HD21997 suggest large amounts of cold primordial gas, while the dust component is clearly secondary debris. In order to find more such \"hybrid disks\", we carried out a survey with APEX. Here we propose to obtain spatially resolved ALMA continuum and CO line observations of our most promising candidate, the debris disk around HD131835, where we detected CO with an intensity suggestive of a hybrid disk. From the observations we will (1) investigate the shielding and lifetime of CO molecules, (2) determine the co-location of the gas and dust components, and (3) decide if the gas is the remnant of the primordial disk, or secondary material produced from icy planetesimals. A primordial origin would suggest the existence of a whole new class of hybrid disks. The presence of primordial gas around >10 Myrs stars contradicts the current paradigm, and provides longer time for the formation of gas giant planets.',\n"," 'The complete ALMA view of the Orion Bar: unexpected structures and processes. We propose to obtain wide-field sub-arcsecond resolution images (0.7 ~300 AU) of the iconic Orion Bar PDR in the bright CO 3-2, HCO+ 4-3 lines, and 850 microns dust continuum emission. The proposed observations will allow us to generalize the unexpected results obtained from our pilot ALMA images of a very small field of the Bar edge (published in Nature). We will investigate the properties of the fragmented ridge of high-density substructures, cloud surface instabilities, and photo-evaporating flows revealed by these first ALMA mosaics. In addition, and to better understand why the H/H2 and C+/C/CO transition zones are so close in the Bar, we request pilot observations of the [CI]492 GHz line. These observations will be interpreted with a new non-stationary model that treats the PDR hydrodynamics and time-dependent chemistry. Therefore, we will be able demonstrate the dynamical and non-equilibrium nature of the interaction between UV radiation from massive stars and their parental molecular cloud. These questions are at the core of our understanding of the stellar radiative feedback, a process taking place at many galactic and extra-galactic scales.',\n"," 'First measurement of \"cloud-scale\" gas-to-dust ratio of a dwarf galaxy WLM. WLM is one of the-lowest-metallicity, star-forming dwarf galaxies within 1-Mpc distance. In the previous cycle, our ALMA high-resolution and high-sensitivity observations discovered ten small molecular clouds with a typical size of 5 pc in diameter (Rubio et al. 2015). We propose 6-hrs dust-continuum mosaic observations in band 7 toward the clouds to measure the metallicity dependence of \"cloud-scale\" gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) for the first time. Based on this proposed observation, we investigate (1) the origin of large scatter of galactic-scale GDR in the low-metallicity regime, (2) star formation histories of WLM by comparing with theoretical dust and galaxy models, and (3) metallicity dependence of a ratio of 850um luminosity and ISM mass. The requested sensitivities is determined based on the LABOCA 870um flux and allow us to detect dust continuum with 14-sigma.',\n"," 'How Strongly are the 2 Known Class 0 Disks Magnetized?. To date only 2 Class 0 objects have well detected, ~100 AU Keplerian circumstellar disks: L1527 and VLA 1623. Other sources with similar or better resolution observations do not exhibit clear Keplerian disks, e.g. L1157, down to 10 AU scale. What is the difference in these two populations? Although a very small sample so far, there is an interesting trend. The sources with 100 AU disks have inferred magnetic fields nearly perpendicular to their disk rotation axis, and the sources without detected 100 AU disks have magnetic fields nearly aligned with their outflow axis (a proxy for the rotation axis). This is suggested by many current theoretical simulations as magnetic braking reduces the angular momentum of material falling onto the disk, resulting in a smaller circumstellar disk: 10 AU or less compared to 100 AU. In this proposal, we request time to measure the dust continuum polarization in the 2 known 100 AU Class 0 disk systems at a resolution of 50 AU. With the ability to constrain the inferred morphology and magnetic field strength in the systems, we will make better theoretical models to investigate magnetic braking and the early disk formation and evolution.',\n"," 'A systematic exploration of the hybrid disk phenomenon around young A-type main-sequence stars. Based on ALMA observations, our group recently defined a new class of circumstellar disks. \"Hybrid disks\" encircle 10-50 Myr old A-type stars, their tenuous dust content resembles debris disks, while their massive gas component is leftover protoplanetary material. So far only four hybrid disks are confirmed, but there are several candidate systems where the lack of information on whether 12CO is optically thick or thin introduces a factor of 100x uncertainty in the gas mass determination. Here we propose to observe 13CO and C18O isotopologues in four hybrid disk candidates with ALMA, in order to decide whether they are hybrid disks or pure secondary disks. We will (1) measure the dust and gas mass of the disks; (2) determine the morphology of dust and gas; (3) identify the origin of gas; and (4) characterize the new class of hybrid disks. The proposed targets will complete a volume-limited sample of massive debris disks around young A-type stars. Our observations have the potential to double the known hybrid disk population, enabling us to establish the incidence of hybrid disks more precisely than ever, which may have consequences on the general disk evolution paradigm.',\n"," 'Molecular gas in low-metallicity extreme starburst galaxies. When trying to understand the process of star formation in starburst galaxies, the cold gas content of the ISM is of fundamental importance. Such studies at high redshift are especially interesting since the mode of star formation in such galaxies appear distinct, with typical star formation rates and surface densities far surpassing normal galaxies at z~0. However, the conversion factor alpha_CO is still under debate – especially at low metallicities. Lyman break analogs (LBAs) offer a great opportunity to study this problem at lower redshift (z~0.2). They have a lower metal content than galaxies with similar masses at z=0.2, and average gas surface densities >1000 M_sun/pc2, serving as proxies for star-forming galaxies at earlier epochs. Here we propose to observe 4 galaxies of lower metallicity down to ~10% of the typical luminosity of star-forming galaxies at redshift z~2; covering two orders of magnitude in mass, we will test whether there is indication of lower CO luminosities and hence different alpha_CO values for low-metallicity LBAs. This dataset will also provide an excellent comparison parameter for high-redshift observations, one of the main scientific goals of ALMA.',\n"," 'The gas content and gas depletion time of massive, normal star forming galaxies beyond z=3. We request rest-frame ~250um continuum observations of a complete sample of 86 massive (log(M_stellar/M_sun) > 10.5) normal star-forming, i.e. main sequence, galaxies at high redshift in an epoch of increasing SFR density (z~3-4) identified in the 2 sq.deg COSMOS field. Using our new, empirically calibrated correlation between mono-chromatic sub-mm luminosity and total gas content we will measure the cool gas mass in these systems. Combined with estimations of their star formation rates from the IR spectral energy distribution (and incoming high-sensitivity Jansky VLA radio continuum imaging), the gas depletion time, or its inverse - the star formation efficiency, of each galaxy will be derived. The proposed observations will provide the first solid measurement of the mean depletion time for normal star-forming galaxies beyond the peak of star formation activity (at z~2-3). A reduced depletion time (relative to local star-forming galaxies) has been inferred for z~1-2.5 samples, but conflicting results based on small (< 5) samples exist beyond these redshifts. These proposed observations are vital in providing the necessary constraints for current galaxy evolution models.',\n"," 'The structure of the detached shells around DR Ser, V644 Sco, and S Sct. In Cycle 6 we proposed to observe the detached shells around the carbon AGB stars DR Ser, V644 Sco, and S Sct in CO(1-0) to determine the evolution of the mass loss from AGB stars during and after a thermal pulse. To recover the flux on all scales, the Cycle 6 observations required two main-array configurations. The extended configuration at 1\" resolution was observed in Cycle 6. We here request to observe the remaining configurations to create a complete dataset that is essential to correctly determine the creation and evolution of the detached shells. The shells span the entire age range of known detached shell sources, allowing us to constrain the mass-loss rate shortly after the thermal pulse, and to follow the evolution of the shells until they get photodissociated. Un unexpected velocity-splitting of the shells in the Cycle 6 data further confirm that the data will constrain the hydrodynamical properties of the shells. The proposed observations will yield the most detailed view of the evolution of the mass loss throughout the TP cycle on the AGB, and will constrain critical aspects of late stellar evolution, and hence of the chemical evolution of stars and the ISM.',\n"," 'Probing Cosmic Dawn: Estimating the Stellar Ages of z~9 Galaxies. Determining the period when the first galaxies emerged from a dark intergalactic medium represents a fundamental milestone in assembling a coherent picture of cosmic history. Recent surveys of z~7-9 galaxies have revealed a population whose red Spitzer IRAC colours either indicate contamination from intense optical emission lines or the presence of a Balmer break due to a mature stellar population. Accurate redshifts are needed to distinguish between these two hypotheses. One example was confirmed via [O III] emission with ALMA at z=9.11 whose Balmer break indicates the onset of star formation occurred as early as z~15±2. We propose to follow up the only further similar z~9 candidate accessible with ALMA to determine if this initial result is a representative indicator of when galaxies first emerged from the Dark Ages.',\n"," 'CO vs. CI in Henize 2-10. We propose a comparative study of CO and CI emission in Henize 2-10, the first dwarf galaxy discovered with a supermassive black hole. Atomic carbon, CI, is an alternative tracer to CO of molecular gas that has received increasing attention in recent years. The ground-state fine-structure line CI at 492 GHz has shown to be a good tracer of molecular gas in Galactic giant molecular clouds (GMCs), where a linear correlation has been found between CI and CO isotopologues. CI and CO have also been found to coexist in external galaxies (e.g., Gerin & Phillips 2000). Yet due to the poor transparency of the Earths atmosphere at 492 GHz, studies of CI in external galaxies are rare. But with ALMAs remarkable sensitivity, we can conduct extragalactic CI observations in a reasonable amount of time. We propose to observe the starburst dwarf galaxy He 2-10 in both CI and CO, with the objective of doing a detailed comparison of the molecular tracers and the GMC properties. We expect to identify at least ~20 CO and CI GMCs; this would be the largest systematic study, to date, which compares CO and CI in the same dwarf galaxy on a systematic basis.',\n"," 'Resolving the Protostellar Population of the Massive Protocluster NGC6334I. Understanding the accretion process in massive protostars requires high resolution centimeter through (sub)millimeter imaging to distinguish dust emission from ionized gas and to probe the molecular gas kinematics down to scales smaller than the accretion radius (~500 AU). Our recent 0.3\" JVLA and 0.6\" SMA observations of the deeply-embedded massive protostellar cluster NGC6334I have revealed two line-rich hot cores, a mysterious 7 mm submillimeter line-free continuum source, and a faint 6 cm continuum source coincident with water masers (JVLA1). We propose to use ALMA to observe NGC6334I with 0.2\" resolution (320 AU at 1.6 kpc) in a range of high excitation diagnostic lines at Band 6 (1.3 mm). At this wavelength the dust opacity should be low enough for spectral line emission to escape and reveal details of the innermost structures (untrue at higher frequencies). We will also obtain a Band 3 continuum image at 0.4\" resolution aimed at detecting previously unknown hypercompact HII regions that may be lurking within this protocluster. Our measurement of the Band 3 to Band 6 spectral index will be essential to discern the nature of JVLA1 and any other new sources that we detect.',\n"," 'Dust Temperatures in 70um Dark IRDCs. Dust temperatures and masses are key physical properties of star-forming cores that are generally hard to estimate. Core masses are important to test theories of high-mass star formation as well as to study the universality of the initial mass function (IMF). In a survey of twelve (70 um dark) high-mass clumps, a total of 294 low-to-intermediate mass cores (71% prestellar) have been detected at 220 GHz. Unfortunately, due to the lack of temperature information at 1\" scales, the conclusions may be misleading and favoring a particular high-mas star formation theory. In this proposal, we aim to obtain dust temperatures at the size scales traced by ALMA. We will carry out a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from 140 to 470 GHz. With both temperatures and masses estimated at 1\" resolution (~4,000 AU), we will tackle the following two questions: 1.) Do high-mass prestellar cores exist at the earliest stages of fragmentation? Can we support or rule out any of the two competing theories? 2.) How does the CMF vary after determining temperatures/masses at the observed core scales?',\n"," 'Extended Star Formation in the Brightest Unlensed Submillimeter Galaxies. Distant SMGs represent the most massive of the young galaxies rapidly building up their mass in the early universe. Their importance in terms of understanding the cosmic stellar mass build-up history is amplified if they represent the pinnacle of the \"cosmic downsizing\" phenomenon. We have obtained 345GHz continuum images at 0.02\" resolution toward three unlensed submillimeter galaxies during cycle 3 of ALMA, with a primary science goal to investigate the detailed spatial distributions of dust in the intrinsically most luminous SMGs as a direct test of how such extreme starbursts can be fueled and sustained. We found that the morphology of dust in the central kpc is highly complex with extreme star formation properties that are comparable to (or exceeding) the Eddington limit for starbursts. We have also found that the amount of missing flux is extremely high (70-85%) compared to lower resolution SMA images, which suggests that the bulk of the star formation is in fact taking place in the extended disk. Here we propose 4 hours of Cycle 4 time in the C40-5 configuration to recover this missing flux and to properly image the dusty star formation activity beyond the central kpc.',\n"," 'Direct imaging of the multi-phase AGN torus of the Circinus galaxy. The nearest type-2 AGN, the Circinus galaxy, shows a pc-scale polar-elongation of warm dust at its center, which contradicts the classic torus paradigm. Recently, we proposed that the radiation-driven fountain model can naturally reproduce this intriguing feature. This model was tested by ALMA Cycle 4 observations of CO(3-2) and [CI](1-0) with 5 pc and 14 pc resolutions, respectively. We found a hint of a difference between the molecular gas dynamics (or geometry) and atomic gas dynamics at the central ~5 pc region, which seems to be driven by atomic outflows (and failed winds) as expected in our model. However, the limited resolutions have not allowed us to fully resolve that intriguing region. Thus, we now request 2 pc resolution mappings of these two lines to clearly delineate the multi-phase structures directly. We also expect to see outflows with [CI](1-0), at above the mid-plane of the disk. The results will be compared with our dedicated simulation for the Circinus to test the model. Our observations will reveal the multi-phase geometrical/dynamical nature of the circumnuclear region, which will explain the long-lasting mystery, the physical origin of the AGN torus.',\n"," 'Disks, winds, and tori -- towards a comprehensive view of the AGN environment with VLTI and ALMA. We want to explore the origin of dusty molecular outflows in AGN by combining data from the highest angular resolution IR and sub-mm facilities VLTI and ALMA. Using VLTI we recently showed that the \"dusty torus\" region is much more complex than models assume: Radiation pressure may drive a clumpy wind that forms a polar outflow. This outflow seems responsible for the bulk of the mid-IR emission seen on <10 pc scales of nearby Seyfert galaxies and may be the origin of kpc scale molecular outflows that are invoked in AGN feedback. While this disk+wind picture emerged from detailed VLTI observations, it lacks an exploration of its physical implications: dense molecular gas orbits the black hole and dense clouds are ejected into the outflow. In this pilot study we want to observe NGC 3783, the poster child of the pc-scale \"dusty outflows\", by mapping the kinematics of J=4-3 high-density tracer lines of HCN, HNC, CO, and HCO+. Do we see the dense rotational disk? Can we prove a significant outflow? And does the IR dust emission trace the high-density regions? These questions can only be solved directly with the unprecedented exploitation of maximal angular resolution of ALMA and VLTI.',\n"," 'Dust Opacity and Fragmentation in the Centers of Nearby Low-mass Starless Cores. With the windfall of recent continuum observations of nearby star-forming regions using Herschel and large ground-based bolometer arrays, it is imperative that we reduce the factor of a few uncertainty that currently exists in (sub)millimeter dust opacities. This uncertainty strongly affects determination of the core mass distribution and core stability. In this proposal, we will directly address two key issues in studies of the nascent phase of star formation - starless cores: (1) what is the dust opacity index (beta) at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, and (2) do starless cores fragment on scales of 100 - 1500 AU? We shall observe a sample of 5 bright, nearby (125 pc) starless cores in the Ophiuchus cloud complex at 2.1, 1.2, and 0.86 mm at 100 AU resolution. We will determine the dust opacity index by radiative transfer modeling of the observed visibilities and compare the results to existing 160-1200 um observations. Our sample includes cores with a range of central densities (1.0e5 - 1.0e6 cm-3) and dynamical states (stable to collapsing) in which to search for fragmentation and to search for variations among the cores in the dust opacity index.',\n"," 'Revolutionary insights into the z>7 gas and dust physics. Although high-z galaxy sample sizes with FIR line and dust continuum detections have known a boost with ALMA, the characterisation of their gas and dust reservoirs remains elusive. We propose to target six FIR lines ([OIII]52,88,[NII]122,[OI]145,[CI]370,CO7-6) and the underlying dust continuum in the brightest [CII]- and dust-detected z=7.306 galaxy (UVISTA-Y-003). This ambitious program will allow us to unambiguously constrain the gas densities, ionisation parameter, ionising photon escape fraction, molecular gas mass and gas-phase O, C and N abundances. We will gain unprecedented insights into the early metal and dust enrichment, the efficiency of star formation, and the contribution of massive galaxies to cosmic reionisation. The exquisite sampling of the rest-frame 52-370 micron dust SED comes for free, and will enable us - for the first time - to cover the z>7 dust SED peak and to constrain the dust temperature, mass and IR luminosity with high precision. The IR luminosity will be crucial to interpret the IRX-beta diagram; whereas the metal and dust masses will allow us to tie down the dominant dust production sources and the importance of gas accretion and outflows.',\n"," 'Proper Motions of Gas in the Immediate Vicinity of the Galactic Supermassive Black Hole. We propose to search for neutral gas at high projected velocities along the line of sight, as an indicator of high possible motions across the line of sight. We propose to use SgrA* as the background source for measuring an absorption line profile. This utilizes the high brightness temperature of SgrA* to compensate for the low optical depth of faint features. By using high excitation lines in the submillimeter bands (HCN(J=4-3),HCO+(J=4-3),CS(J=7-6),H13CN(J=4-3),HC15N(J=4-3)), we will sample material which are hopefully closer to the Galactic Center. This will also minimize confusion from the lower excitation material, which will not populate the higher energy levels of the molecules. We propose to utilize SgrA* to provide an effective “delta-function pencil beam”. This improves upon the normal synthesized beam provided by the interferometer. With the multi-epoch measurements, our goals are: (1) detect and measure the line profile of high excitation transitions in absorption against SgrA*, (2) measure the time variation of the proper motions of the clouds in front of SgrA*, (3) measure the chemical species that survive immediately surrounding SgrA*.',\n"," 'The jet/outflow system in BHR71. The interstellar medium (ISM) is constantly out-of-equilibrium, with energy continuously injected in various forms: mechanical, photons, or cosmic rays. The propagation of shocks is ubiquitous in the ISM, where it represents an important part of the mechanical energy input. In particular, shocks are generated by the birth of stars in the form of jets and bipolar outflows, where they play an important role in the evolution of the interstellar medium. The study of jet/outflows interactions is paramount to understand the star formation processes and scenarios, but also to evaluate the impacts of the shocks on the local interstellar medium. Unfortunately, in low-mass protostellar environments, these tasks are made difficult by the faintness of the jet component. For the first time, we propose to observe the jet/outflow system in the low mass protostellar outflow BHR71, where our complementary observations strongly suggest the presence of a high-velocity jet. With the requested observations, we will characterize the shocks associated to the jet and outflow, study their energetic and chemical impacts on the environment, and also evaluate their efficiency in accelerating cosmic rays.',\n"," 'The Quest for a robust AGN diagnostic in the (sub-)millimeter domain. We propose to study physical and chemical properties of dense gas tracers towards the central kpc region of the nearby active galaxy, NGC 7469, which hosts a type-1 Seyfert nucleus with a circumnuclear starburst ring of 480 pc in radius. Although HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CO line ratios for nearby AGNs are typically higher than those of non-AGN galaxies in our previous studies, NGC 7469 does not coincide with this result. This inconsistency is likely due to contamination from the surrounding ~1.5\" ring like starburst caused by insufficient spatial resolution. Therefore, we have selected a set of key dense gas tracers including HCN, HCO+, SiO, CS and HNCO to probe the physical and chemical properties of the central AGN and starburst at sufficient spatial resolution (0.65\"~200 pc at the distance of NGC 7469) to separate these two structures. The proposed molecules can be efficiently observed in Band 3 and 7 thanks to the superb spectroscopic capability of ALMA. With the proposed measurements, we will address the following issues: (1)abundance ratio variations of HCN, HCO+, and CS: Can we see HCN enhancement in the nucleus of NGC 7469 at high resolution observation? (2) Detection of the SiO and HNCO emission in the active nucleus of NGC 7469: Is the central dense gas condensation heated by X-rays or shocks? (3)Searching for vibrationally excited HCN: Does AGN activity promote this emission? (4) Kinematics of the dense molecular gas: Is there an inconsistency of kinematics between CO and HCN? This program will provide us with unique insights that will help answer the questions described above. Also, we will compare the obtained spectrum and line ratios of NGC 7469 with our ALMA Cycle 0 results of NGC 1097, another type-1 Seyfert galaxy with a starburst ring, but much less luminous AGN than NGC 7469. This comparison will help us to study the effect of different AGN luminosity on the surrounding ISM.',\n"," 'NGC 4650A: the prototype Polar Ring Galaxy. Polar-ring galaxies (PRG) are a unique class of objects, tracing special episodes in the galaxy mass assembly: they can be formed through galaxy interaction and merging, but also through accretion from cosmic filaments.

We propose to map in the CO(3-2) line at high resolution the polar ring of NGC4650A, the prototype of the class. The polar disk is the most recently assembled sub-system, very rich in gas and where new stars are formed. We will determine the gas distribution and the star formation efficiency, with possible thresholds. The high resolution kinematics of the molecular gas, predominant in the central parts, will precise with more accuracy the determination of the 3D-potential, already tackled through optical, near-infrared, and HI-21cm data. Through comparison with numerical models this will help to deduce the dark matter content and the halo 3D-shape.',\n"," 'A 3mm Line Survey of IRC+10216 : The chemical view of a C-rich object. IRC+10216 is a carbon rich evolved star in which more than 50% of molecules known in space have been detected.

Recent ALMA cycle0 observations at 270 GHz (Cernicharo et al., 2013) have shown the presence of hundreds of unidentified and intense lines arising from the dust formation zone. The carriers of these lines are certainly participating in the nucleation and growth of dust grains. We propose to carry out a sensitive line survey at 3mm with the following goals : 1) To fully characterize the molecular composition of the dust formation zone. 2) To fully characterize from several transitions of C4H, C5H, C6H, C7H, and their anions, the physical and chemical composition of the molecular ring where these species are formed. 3) To study the spatial distribution of the gas from the innermost regions (0.4\") to the external chemically rich ring at r=14\".',\n"," 'Probing Jet Rotation in a Protostellar Jet. Protostellar jets are believed to be launched from accretion disks around protostars, carrying away extra angular momenta from the disks, allowing material to fall onto the protostars. Their launching radius and thus model (X-wind v.s. disk-wind) are still uncertain but could be determined from their rotation properties, which can be measured with ALMAs unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. HH 211 is a nearby source with well-defined jets lying almost in the plane of the sky, and its first pair of knots being within 100 AU of the source, ideal for jet rotation measurements. We have previously mapped this source at ~0.05\" resolution in Cycle 4 with a tentative detection of jet rotation. Here, we propose to observe HH 211 with ALMA at ~0.016\" resolution in order to fully resolve the position-velocity structure and measure its rotation precisely. By measuring the jet rotation properties accurately, we can calculate the jet launching radius and determine the jet launching model without the need to resolve the inner-most part of the disk near the protostar.',\n"," 'Testing for efficient grain growth in the dust trap around Sz 91. The probably most popular model for giant planet formation is the core accretion scenario. However, this model is facing serious difficulties. One of the most severe challenges for the model certainly is to overcome the radial drift barrier which is supposed to prevent the formation of planetesimals. Particle traps generated by pressure bumps in the disk are one possibility to slow the radial drift and allow planetesimals to form. In recent years we have characterized the transition disk around the young stellar object Sz91. Based on ALMA Band 7 continuum data (of 0.2 arcsec resolution) we found that the mm-sized particles accumulate in a sharp ring radially unresolved. This ring structure might represent a radial particle trap in which planetesimals could form. We here propose to observe this disk in Band 4 and 7 at high resolution to constrain the sharpness of the ring and the particle size distribution.',\n"," 'Resolving the molecular gas within 100 pc of M87s supermassive black hole. The proximity of M87 (3C 274), the archetypical giant elliptical radio galaxy at the centre of the Virgo galaxy cluster, presents a unique opportunity to investigate in detail the circumnuclear molecular gas revealed first by CO J=1-0 observations with the IRAM 30-m and more recently imaged for the first time with ALMA (this teams Cycle 1 data). The preliminary results from the ALMA data show that the molecular gas is unresolved and resides within 100~pc of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Resolving the molecular gas for the first time is now possible with ALMAs long baseline capability. We were awarded time in Cycle 3 to do this, but unfortunately observation of the project was not completed and so we wish to resubmit this proposal for Cycle 4. With this Cycle 4 proposal we therefore wish to obtain 0.16 (~12~pc) imaging of the CO J=1-0 line to unambiguously resolve the molecular gas structures for the first time, allowing us to investigate the nature and origin of molecular gas that resides within the 3.1 sphere of influence (SOI) of the SMBH in unprecedented detail.',\n"," 'The Fellowship of the Rings: Completing the Sample. ALMA has discovered many protoplanetary disks with ring-like structures indicative of forming giant planets. Many of these rings are detected in larger disks, but how common these sub structures are remains unknown because not all disks have been imaged at the sufficient spatial resolution. If such structures are caused by pressure bumps that stops dust from drifting inward, all large disks are likely to have rings detectable with ALMA. We propose to observe 24 protoplanetary disks at a spatial resolution of 0.12\" to complete a uniform survey of extended disks (>30 au) in Taurus, Lupus, Chamaeleon, and Ophiuchus. On top of discovering new ringed disks, we will use this homogenous catalogue to characterize the prevalence of disk rings and characterize the distribution of gap width, depths, and locations to put empirical constraints on the mechanisms halting radial drift, and link this distribution with exoplanet population statistics.',\n"," 'WISDOM: Measuring High-mass Supermassive Black Holes using CO Kinematics.

In previous work, we have shown that it is straightforward to measure SMBH masses by resolving the Keplerian rise of the galaxy rotation curves, using ALMA to trace the kinematics of the CO gas. As part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses, we have identified a group of 9 promising targets that populate this high-mass region. Through measuring the SMBH mass, and spatially resolving molecular clouds near to the SMBH, we aim to shed light on how different evolutionary paths lead to the most massive black holes in our universe.',\n"," 'NGC 4945: The Milky Ways not-so-distant Cousin - ACA Standalone Mapping of the Full Disk in Band 3 Dense Gas Tracers. Star formation correlates mostly directly with dense gas, but spectroscopic tracers of dense gas are incredibly faint with low surface brightness. As a result, we still know relatively little about the resolved structure of dense gas in galaxy disks and its relation to other parts of the galaxy. To address, we propose ACA standalone mapping of the full disk of the nearest starburst+disk galaxy NGC 4945 in Band 3 dense gas tracers (8 lines in total). Our map will cover 10kpc along the major axis of the galaxy, extending previous dense gas studies of starburst systems which focus heavily on galaxy nuclei (<1arcmin^2). This will yield continuous, uniform measurements of the dense gas abundance and efficiency spanning from the starburst nucleus across the disk environments, adressing major open questions. The inclined geometry and proximity of the target and the need for surface brightness sensitivity make this a highly productive, novel use of the ACA.',\n"," 'Submm Maser in NGC 1052. ALMA has just detected the 321-GHz water maser emission in the radio galaxy NGC 1052. This is the first discovery of sub-mm maser in a radio-loud active galactic nucleus and the most luminous 321-GHz maser ever known. In order to clarify the spatial distribution of the maser components, we propose a DDT observation with the C-10 configuration that offers a 0\".013 resolution corresponding to 1.15 pc. With high SNR > 20, the array yields position accuracy of 0.1 pc with respect to the unresolved continuum core. Our aims are (1) concrete evidence for non-thermal emission with the brightness temperature > 2000 K, (2) location of the masers with respect to the unresolved continuum core with a sub-pc accuracy, and (3) velocity gradient of the masers to assess dynamics near the central supermassive black hole.',\n"," 'Understanding the launching mechanism of ionized winds in massive protostars. Massive stars strongly ionise their surroundings forming UC HII regions. The kinematics of the ionised gas can be probed by hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRLs). A few objects present maser effects in their RRL emission and thanks to their large amplification, one can study in great detail the kinematics and physical structure of the innermost, ionised regions around massive protostars. Recent high-angular resolution images (beam ~0.08\"x0.06\", 70au x 50 au) of the H21alpha line obtained with ALMA toward the MonR2-IRS2 massive YSO, have resolved for the first time the ionised gas for radii <85 au (<0.1\"). The gas seems to be distributed into possibly a disk and a high-velocity ionised wind. The reached sensitivity and angular resolution was however insufficient to study in detail the kinematics of the putative disk and of the high-velocity gas associated with this source. We propose to image the H26alpha line in Band 7 at an angular resolution of 0.03\" (~25 au) to constrain the structure and kinematics of the disk and to establish the launching radius of the wind. This will allow us to determine the most likely launching mechanism for ionized winds in massive protostars.',\n"," 'Unlocking the Potential of the Most Definitive Molecular Tracer of UV-Enhancement: l-C3H+. The recently-discovered interstellar molecule l-C3H+ appears to be the most sensitive and definitive molecular tracer of enhanced UV-flux ever observed in the ISM. Extensive, deep searches for this species in dozens of sources show its presence exclusively in UV-enhanced regions. Yet, our understanding of the spatial distribution of the molecule within these sources, and the excitation conditions (and abundances) in previously-observed regions, is sorely lacking. Here, we propose ALMA observations following up on prior detections in three PDR regions with the IRAM 30m telescope to understand the spatial distribution, abundance, and excitation of this potentially transformational molecule in our ability to probe the extent of UV-enhanced flux in these and other key regions. The results will be used to refine state-of-the-art PDR chemical modeling codes, and inform related ALMA proposals to observe this molecule in protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'First step for a systematic study of the molecular gas in interacting galaxies at every evolutionary stage. We propose to measure the 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) lines of 8 interacting systems to reveal the variations of molecular gas properties on kiloparsec scales during the merging process. From the resolved 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) mapping survey EDGE-CALIFA, we select the 8 less-luminous interacting galaxies that are at different merging stages. We aim to focus on the changes of physical condition of molecular gas that are mostly likely due to the interacting process for the selected samples. Combining 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) with the archival 1-0 observations from the EDGE-CALIFA, we will constrain the density, temperature, and/or isotopologue abundance of the proposed targets on kiloparsec scales. We will also study the relations of molecular gas conditions to stellar and ionized gas properties at every merging stages, using the ancillary resolved optical IFU data from EDGE-CALIFA. This study will be the first step for a systematic study of the molecular gas in interacting galaxies to obtain a comprehensive picture of the merging process.',\n"," 'A sub-kpc search for obscured substructures in z ~ 2 star-forming `main-sequence galaxies. Evidence is mounting that galaxies assembled most of their stellar mass via accretion of cold gas, leading to gas-rich, unstable disks and disk-wide clumpy star formation. Indeed, rest-frame UV images show bright star-forming clumps in galaxies at z ~ 2. But ALMA images now show that these clumps contain only a small fraction of the young stars; the star-forming clumps predicted by theory must be heavily obscured, or our picture of galaxy assembly needs to be re-thought. We will search for clumps in the obscured, intensely star-forming regions of z ~ 2 galaxies by observing the two highest S/N SFGs found in the ALMA HUDF survey that are on the main-sequence and show no sign of AGN. We propose sub-kpc resolution 870 micron dust continuum imaging of them; size constraints from ALMA HUDF images guarantee effective investment of significant ALMA time. Finding obscured clumps will revolutionize our view of the type of clumps that contribute to bulge assembly and provide critical inputs for simulations. Finding smooth disks at z ~ 2 may imply clump migration occurred at earlier times, guiding the search to higher redshift, or it may require new mechanisms facilitating bulge formation.',\n"," 'A Magnified View of Black Hole/Galaxy Co-Evolution at the Epoch of Reionization. Gravitational lensing allows studies of distant galaxies and quasars with enhanced sensitivities and resolution beyond the limit of current instrumentation. We recently discovered an ultraluminous lensed quasar/starburst system at z=6.51, the most distant lensed quasar known and the first such object detected at the epoch of reionization. Lens models based on HST observations show that the quasar is magnified by a factor of ~25. We propose to carry out high resolution ALMA Band-6 observations of the dust continuum and [CII] emission of the quasar host galaxy. Our main science goal is to use the lensing reconstructed dust continuum image to measure the spatial distribution of star formation in the central starburst surrounding the accreting black hole (BH), reaching a resolution of <100pc, comparable to the scale of the sphere of influence for a billion M_sun BH. We will also use the reconstructed [CII] map to probe the host galaxy ISM kinematics, estimate its dynamical mass and search for signatures of a galaxy merger and AGN feedback. The proposed ALMA observation will provide a unique laboratory to study BH/galaxy co-evolution at cosmic dawn in unprecedented detail.',\n"," 'DETECTING THE CIRCUMPLANETARY DISK AROUND THE SPIRAL-ARM-DRIVING PLANET IN A PROTOPLANETARY DISK. We propose Band-7 observations of MWC 758, a protoplanetary disk with a remarkable pair of spiral arms detected at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, with an 0\".05 angular resolution to look for signatures from the circumplanetary disk (CPD) around the planet MWC 758 b, as well as to characterize the spiral arms. The planet was predicted by our models as the driver of the arms, and has very recently been detected in our Keck/NIRC2 NIR adaptive optics (AO) imaging observations at ~4.5-sigma level. The proposed observation is based on detailed simulations of the system, and presents the most promising opportunity to result in the first definitive detection of a CPD in a disk. Once detected, this will be the first feature-producing planet quantitatively predicted by disk-planet interaction models, and will likely open another door in planet detection. Still forming in gaseous disks, this planet will be among the youngest discovered, and will help address two fundamental questions in planet formation: where and when do gas giant planets form.',\n"," 'Highlighting the Centrifugal Barrier in Protostellar Envelopes by Chemistry. In star formation studies, one of the most important issues is when and how the rotationally supported disk is formed around a protostar. In this proposal, we approach this problem by chemistry. With our ALMA Cycle 0 observations toward the low-mass Class 0 protostar L1527, we discovered a drastic chemical change in the transition zone between the infalling rotating envelope and the inner disk. Carbon-chain molecules as well as CS mainly exist in the infalling rotating envelope, whereas SO selectively trace the transition zone. This drastic change seems to originate from the accretion shock in front of the centrifugal barrier. Thus, chemistry can highlights the transition zone. Moreover, the protostellar mass and the specific angular momentum can easily be derived by the radius of the centrifugal barrier and the rotation velocity there. Based on this success in L1527, we apply this method to 5 low-mass protostellar sources in the Class 0 and I stages with different chemical and physical characteristics to verify the applicability of this method. This observation will open a new avenue to study the physical and chemical evolution associated with disk formation.',\n"," 'Lyman excess and accretion in OB-type (proto)stars. Taking advantage of the VLA/CORNISH and Herschel/Hi-GAL unbiased surveys, we have recently estimated the Lyman continuum and bolometric luminosities of a sample of bona-fide, young Galactic HII regions. An intriguing finding of our study is that 1/3 of these have Lyman continuum emission in excess of the maximum value expected for the observed bolometric luminosity. We have also searched for infall signatures in the molecular clumps around the HII regions and found that those with Lyman excess are preferentially associated with infall signatures. Conversely, the molecular gas around HII regions without Lyman excess does not appear to be infalling. Based on these results, we now want to confirm the existence of a tight association between infall and Lyman excess by imaging the molecular and ionized gas towards two selected HII regions with Lyman excess and infall signatures. Our expectation is that the proposed ALMA observations will resolve the velocity field around and inside the HII region and will establish the existence of accretion onto the early-type star.',\n"," 'ALMAGAL: ALMA Evolutionary study of High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy. A large fraction of stars form in clusters containing high-mass stars, which affect the local and galaxy-wide environment. Yet fundamental questions about the physics responsible for fragmenting molecular Clumps into Cores are still open. What are the physical characteristics of core fragments in dense clumps as a function of evolution? To what extent is fragmentation driven by dynamics in clumps or mass transport in filaments? ALMAGAL aims at observing 1mm continuum and lines toward more than 1000 dense clumps with M>500 M_sun and d < 7.5 kpc with similar linear resolution. The sample covers all evolutionary stages from IRDC to HII regions from the tip of the Bar to the outskirts of the Galaxy. The setup with 0.1 mJy sensitivity will enable a complete study of the clump-to-core fragmentation process down to at least 1000 AU and 0.3 M_sun Galaxy-wide, mapping the temperature and the local/global infall velocity patterns of the cores-hosting clumps. ALMAGAL publicly accessible data cubes and catalogs will be an invaluable legacy of ALMA, that will allow numerous community followup studies. To increase the impact, we will waive our proprietary rights on the entire dataset.',\n"," 'ALPPS: a survey of polarization toward the youngest protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud. What is the role of the magnetic field in determining stellar multiplicity? Recent surveys of very young, Class 0 protostars in the Perseus star-forming region have shown that proto-binary sources fragment on two different size scales: wide (~1000 au separation) and close (<250 au separation). The interpretation of this result is that turbulent fragmentation is the dominant formation mechanism at scales >1000 au, whereas the fragmentation of circumbinary disks dominates at scales <250 au. We propose an 850 micron (Band 7) ALMA survey of dust polarization toward 38 of the brightest Class 0 protostars in the Perseus star-forming region in order to study the role of the magnetic field in the formation of this bimodal population of binary sources. Our proposed ALMA observations of the magnetic fields in our sample of protostars in Perseus -- combined with complementary archival observations of stellar multiplicity, dust polarization, and spectral lines toward the same sample of sources from the VLA, ALMA, and GBT -- will allow us to test whether the predicted results of these fragmentation paradigms are correct.',\n"," '(Why) Is CenA a source of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays: Shock acceleration, jet and UHECR composition. Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) are protons or nuclei with energies in excess of 4x10^19 eV (a few Joules). The Pierre Auger Observatory has revolutionized astronomy with UHECRs: precise arrival directions and large samples of UHECRs (which suffer the least deflections in magnetic fields) finally allow studies of the source population(s). There is a statistically significant excess of UHECRs detected in the direction of the nearest radiogalaxy Cen A; this is not hugely surprising as radiogalaxies have long been suspected as the source of UHECRs. Many uncertainties remain including UHECR composition, their acceleration mechanisms, and the (multiple?) source populations. We propose to study the dynamics and physical conditions of one confirmed and five probable molecular clouds in the halo of Cen A (probable remnants of the accreted spiral galaxy) which shock and deflect the northern radio jet of CenA, and form an optimal breeding ground for UHECRs. Our immediate goals are (1) confirm the presence of molecular clouds; their high metallicities can originate seed heavy UHECRs; (2) ascertain the dynamics and masses of the clouds and thus constrain their origin and lifetimes; (3) from momentum transfer arguments constrain the jet composition (light or heavy); (4) determine the energetics of the shock fronts: are these sufficient to accelerate UHECRs?',\n"," 'ALMA Unveils the Hierarchical Formation of Massive Galaxies. Our team has used ALMA continuum imaging from Cycle 0 and Cycle 2 to discover that wide-field Herschel and ASTE/AzTEC surveys can be used to uncover blends of multiple DSFGs with pairwise separations that are significantly smaller than what is found from ALMA follow-up of other single-dish surveys. Theoretical simulations have difficulty reproducing this population of multi-component and small-separation DSFGs, but they suggest that a portion of the population may be due to line-of-sight projection effects and are not physically related. We obtained CARMA and PdBI obsevations of CO(3-2) and CO(4-3) indicating this is not the case for one target, but a larger sample size is needed to push this test to the next level. We propose a redshift search for CO emission in 2 targets with four or more ALMA counterparts from our Cycle 0 program and CO imaging of 2 additional targets with 3 or more ALMA counterparts and a known redshift. The redshift search data are critically needed to test whether the ALMA counterparts are physically associated, and the CO kinematics are essential to inform theories of how stars form in these complex systems.',\n"," 'Multi-transition Analysis of Molecular Gas in the Luminous Merger NGC 3256. We propose ACA observations of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 3256 to combine the data with our existing 12 m-array datasets and facilitate multi-transition excitation analysis for extended emission. NGC 3256 is a merging galaxy with active star formation that is most bolometrically luminous within z=0.01. We have been observing the galaxy with ALMA since Cycle 0, targeting the merger gas dynamics, evolution of the two nuclei, the dual outflows that we discovered, and the star-forming interstellar medium. However, some of the data do not have short-baseline information making it difficult to conduct multi-line excitation analysis with line ratios for the physical conditions of extended molecular gas. By supplementing ACA data to several lines, this program aims to reveal the physical conditions of the star-forming molecular gas in the merger disk and the extended molecular outflow from the northern merger nucleus.',\n"," 'Spiral Arms and Accretion Motion in the Circumbinary Disk around the Protostellar Binary System L1551 NE. We propose follow-up ALMA Cycle 2 observations of the protostellar binary L1551 NE in the 0.9-mm dust continuum and C18O (3-2) and multiple lines at Band 7. Our ALMA Cycle 0 observation of L1551 NE found intriguing substructures of the circumbinary disk around the protostellar binary in the continuum emission, and non-axisymmetric gas motions in the line emission. Models of circumbinary disks around protostellar binaries make the generic predictions of spiral arms and non-axisymmetric gas motions, and our Cycle 0 results are consistent with those models. The angular resolution of the Cycle 0 data is, however, not high enough to unambiguously unveil the spiral arms and disentangle the gas motions in the spiral arms, inter-arm regions, and the circumstellar disks around the individual protostars. In Cycle 2, with the maximum 1.5 km baselines, we aim to unambiguously unveil the winding spiral arms, and gas motions in the spiral arms, inter-arm regions, and the circumstellar disks at a spatial resolution of ~0.13″. By comparing the Cycle 2 images with our theoretical model, we will study the accretion motion onto the protostellar binary in the circumbinary disk.',\n"," 'Out of the shadows, into the light. A full examination of the disk around HD 100453. Comparison of our ALMA observations of HD 100453 at 1.3 mm with NIR high contrast images of the same disk yields surprising insights. We detect emission at the stellar position which may come from gap-crossing accretion streams or a compact inner disk, as has been predicted from the shadows it casts on the outer disk. However, the ALMA counterpart of these shadows shows an increase in emission rather than a decrease as would be expected from a shadowed, lower temperature, disk region. The continuum emission in the outer disk shows most contrast at the location of the two spiral arms, and the 9 mm ATCA map shows a vortex-like structure under the northern spiral. Lastly, the companion at 1.05 separation is embedded in the disk as traced by CO gas, which rules out co-planar motion and puts into question whether these object are bound in orbit. This comparison evokes many questions that we propose to answer with a thorough investigation of the disk. Are the dark lanes on the outer disk really shadows? And if they are, what provokes the misalignment of the inner disk? If the stellar companion doesnt drive the spirals, what does? And is there a dust trap hidden in the outer disk?',\n"," 'Revealing Magnetic Field Structures: IM-mass Cores in OMC-3. Understanding the magnetic field on size scales smaller than a core (<0.05 pc) is crucial to see how the magnetic field is responsible for setting initial conditions of star-formation. We propose polarization and molecular line observations toward candidates of intermediate-mass prestellar and protostellar cores in OMC-3, where is the nearest ideal laboratory for studying the magnetically regulated core-collapse process. Proposed polarization observations will spatially resolve the polarization distribution and we aim to measure the polarization degree down to 200 AU scale for all the targets, and down to 12 AU for the brightest and youngest protostellar source found in OMC-3. Proposed line observations will directly image core internal structures such as pseudo disk, circumstellar disk, and root of the outflow, and reveal their kinematic structures with the same angular resolution obtained for polarization images. The obtained results will be compared and iterated with theoretical models (MHD simulations) optimized specifically for our targets, and finally study how the magnetic field changes with respect to the evolutionary stages of cores.',\n"," 'Investigating the water deuteration in a young protostellar system. The evolution of water from its formation in the molecular cloud until its incorporation in the protoplanetary disk and then comets and asteroids is still unclear. Measuring the water D/H ratio is particularly helpful to answer this question. We propose to carry out multi-line observations of the water isotopologues (HDO, H2-18O and D2O) at high spatial resolution (0.3arcsec, 35 AU diameter) towards the inner regions of the well-known Class 0 protobinary IRAS16293-2422, which is now possible thanks to the enhanced capabilities of ALMA cycle 2. Through the study of the kinematics and the determination of the HDO/H2O and D2O/H2O ratios with radius from the protostars, we can determine if the water present at the Class 0 stage was preserved or reprocessed until its incorporation in disks and primitive icy bodies. The data will also allow us to determine the mechanisms that control the water vapor abundance in the warm inner regions of Class 0 protostars.',\n"," 'A magnified view of the cradle of globular clusters at z>6. We propose deep ALMA observations of the central, strongly magnified central multi-image of a giant Ly-alpha nebula which contains two globular cluster precursors (GCPs) at redshift >6. We will detect the 2P3/2-2P1/2 [CII] transition, one dominant neutral gas coolant. The systems embedded within the nebula are among the faintest spectroscopically confirmed star-forming sources at high redshift, have typical instrinsic sizes of 10-20 pc, UV magnitudes >~30 and SFR surface densities greater than 300 Msun/yr/kpc^2. Through band 6 observations with 0.5\" FWHM resolution (probing delensed ~200 pc at z~6), we aim at tracing the distribution of the neutral gas in (and around) the two compact systems. According to our estimates, ~3 hr of ALMA time will be enough to detect [CII] and to: 1) assess the morphology of the neutral gas distribution around the two clusters. Coupled to extant Ly-alpha data, this will allow us to establish the presence of the cold gas which fuels star formation; 2) constrain the gas consumption timescale and, therefore, the duration of the SF event of our objects. Such pieces of information will open a new path to multiwavength studies of GCPs at high z.',\n"," 'Deciphering the large- and small-scale B-field morphology in a massive star-forming clump. Determining the morphology of the magnetic field in high-mass star-forming regions is crucial for understanding their role and importance in the formation of massive stars. G31.41+0.31 is a well-known example of an OB-cluster forming clump with an hourglass magnetic field in the inner 0.1 pc, as resolved by high-resolution (0.2-arcsecond) 0.89-1.3 mm dust polarization maps. However, a recent 2-arcsecond resolution 7 mm polarization map revealed that the large-scale (0.4 pc) magnetic field is rather uniform and perpendicular to the axis of the small-scale hourglass field. We hypothesize that this discrepancy is caused by the misinterpretation of the 0.89-1.3 mm map due to missing short-spacing data or that the 0.89-1.3 mm and 7 mm maps trace different polarization mechanisms. To investigate this discrepancy, we propose a 0.2-arcsecond resolution, optically thin, full polarization observation at 2.1 mm (band 4) that could recover the cloud up to 20\" (~0.4 pc). We aim to discern how the large-scale uniform B-field is connected to the small-scaled hourglass field and clear up the polarization mechanism(s) traced in previous studies.',\n"," 'Clarifying onset of strong binary interaction in SN 2018ivc 1000 years before its demise. A supernova (SN) provides a unique probe to the still-unresolved evolution of massive stars in the final ~1000 years. We propose a DDT observation of SN 2018ivc in Bands 3 and 6, at ~1400 days since the explosion (Aug-Sep 2022). SN 2018ivc was detected by ALMA from 4 days to ~200 days after the SN explosion, showing a usual decay. Just recently, it has been noticed that the SN started rebrightening somewhere between 200 and 1000 days, which was found by inspecting ALMA data taken at ~ 1000 days (which targeted the host, covering the SN serendipitously). Such rebrightening is unprecedented, known only for a few SNe in cm wavelengths, but not in mm. The timing corresponds to ~1000 years before the SN, which matches to the onset of strong binary interaction scenario for this SN. The proposed observation will for the first time tell us about what happens at the onset of strong binary interaction, which has never been identified observationally. The proposed observation will thus provide a milestone to understand the final evolution of a massive star especially in the context of the binary evolution scenario, which is relevant to the majority, if not all, of massive stars.',\n"," 'SN1987A: A Unique Laboratory of Shock, Molecular and Dust Physics. Supernovae are critical engines driving the evolution of interstellar gas in galaxies: the dominant source of mechanical and chemical feedback from star formation, an important source of dust creation, and the origin of energetic particles. Supernova SN1987A is the brightest and nearest supernova observed since Keplers SN1604 and there are important outstanding questions about shock physics and the production of dust in supernovae that only ALMA can answer. Exciting new scientific opportunities available to Cycle 1 ALMA include: confirmation of the remarkably high dust mass produced in the ejecta, verification of CO emission from the ejecta, high enough spatial resolution of the nonthermal particle-accelerating ring to resolve it and separate it from the X-ray emitting shock front, studying the spatial and temporal evolution of the remnant, and searching directly for the elusive compact remnant. A wealth of scientific information is accessible with a small investment of telescope time: We propose to image the continuum in all four bands to separate and analyze dust emission from the inner debris, nonthermal emission from particles accelerated by the outer shock, and any possible thermal bremsstrahlung and compact remnant. We will additionally image broad (~2500 km/s FWHM) CO 1-0 and 2-1 emission from the central debris.',\n"," 'The ISM distribution, gas kinematics and system dynamics of five rotation-dominated quasar-starburst systems at z > 6.

We reduced ALMA archival [CII] data of ~100 z~6 quasars, and selected five objects that are [CII]-brightest and rotation-dominated quasar-starburst systems. With the proposed high resolution ALMA [CII] observations combined with archival short-baseline [CII] data, we will study the spacial distribution and the extent of the ISM, the resolved [C II]-FIR deficit, and the heating mechanism of the dust. With 3D tilted ring kinematic modeling, we will study the gas kinematics in the sub-kpc to kpc regions, and search for evidence of non-circular motions. Through dynamical modeling, we are able to investigate the composition and the distribution of mass matters in these quasar-host systems. Especially, we will have the dynamical measurements of the black hole masses in the earliest Universe for the first time. In addition, we will investigate the coevolution of quasars and their hosts across cosmic time.',\n"," 'A Novel Exploration of Gas Content in Protoplanetary Disks. Observations of the Lupus star-forming region have revealed disks with low gas masses (<1 Jupiter mass) and gas-to-dust ratios (~1-10) based on CO isotopologue emission. This has implications for theories of planet formation because the disks are relatively young, only 1-3 Myr old. Alternatively, the disks could be CO-depleted resulting in underestimates of the total gas mass based on CO isotopologues. Current observations are insufficient for determining whether the disks are CO-depleted or not. We propose to use additional gas tracers, N2H+ and HCO+, in combination with the current CO isotopologue data and our thermo-chemical models to check for CO depletion. Our models reveal distinct trends in the relative line ratios of these three tracers for the CO-depleted vs. low gas-to-dust ratio cases. To test if these trends are realized, we select several disks from the Lupus region that span over an order of magnitude in gas-to-dust ratios derived from the dust mm emission and CO isotopologues. By probing for evidence of CO depletion, we will be able to determine if the disks have additional gas not well tracked by CO rotational lines.',\n"," 'Detailed Physical Properties of the Interstellar Medium of a z=5.2 Dusty Starburst. Studies of the interstellar medium (ISM) at high redshift have progressed tremendously in the past years, but studies of the physical properties based on a suite of fine structure lines (which are critical for studying the earliest cosmic epochs, where CO is faint due to decreasing metallicity) are still in their beginning stages. We here propose an in-depth study of the ISM based on six CNO fine structure lines in a massive starburst galaxy at redshift 5.2 (where all lines fall into a \"sweet spot\" in the atmosphere), allowing us to push these studies back to the first billion years of cosmic time. This will allow us to measure the fraction of [CII] emission that originated from the neutral vs. ionized medium, the density of both the neutral and ionized medium, the effective temperature in HII regions associated with star-forming clouds, and the O/N abundance ratio. This study will detect fine structure lines up to rest-frame wavelengths of 52 micron in one of the most distant starburst galaxies known, making it an ideal demonstration case for the new ALMA band-10 receivers.',\n"," 'Solving the Discrepancy between Spectroscopic and Dynamical Stellar Mass Determinations of Lupus YSOs. We analyzed the archival data of the ALMA survey in 13CO (3-2) toward 89 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus star-forming region, and obtained dynamical stellar mass estimates for 45 young stars in the survey. We found that there is a group of young stars having their spectroscopically determined stellar masses systematically lower than our dynamical estimates. It is possible that systematic uncertainties are affecting the spectroscopic determinations. However, due to the low S/N of the current ALMA data, the origins of the discrepancy between the dynamical and spectroscopic estimates are unclear, and the accuracy of our dynamical estimates is not sufficient to provide a meaningful benchmark against the spectroscopic determinations. Thus, we propose ALMA observations in CO isotopologues toward four young stars having the best spectroscopically determined stellar masses in the Lupus survey. With the proposed observations, we aim to provide precise dynamical stellar mass estimates as benchmarks for pre-main sequence stellar models adopted in the spectroscopic stellar mass determinations.',\n"," 'Measuring star formation rates in the dusty starburst galaxy NGC 1808 using mm recombination lines. The compact circumnuclear starburst in NGC 1808 has one of the highest infrared and radio fluxes of any starburst in the southern sky and is therefore an ideal case for comparing and calibrating star formation metrics. We propose to observe the H40alpha and H42alpha recombination line emission and the free-free 84.7-100.4 GHz continuum emission from the heavily obscured photoionized gas in this starburst. The results will produce star formation rates with accuracies of ~10% that can then be used to recalibrate infrared and radio star formation metrics. The results from this galaxy can then be used to measure more accurate star formation rates for other compact starbursts in both the nearby and more distant universe.',\n"," 'Resolving the star-forming ISM at z~2-3. We propose resolved (0.45”), matched-resolution mapping of the CO, [CII], and underlying dust continuum in a carefully selected sample of z~2-3 galaxies in the ECDFS. The proposed targets were drawn from our Cycle 0 870um survey of >100 sub-mm galaxies (SMGs), the largest, most homogenous, and best-studied sample of interferometrically observed SMGs to date. Our recently completed spectroscopic follow-up campaign has allowed us to meticulously identify 4 SMGs with redshifts that allow us to observe both low-J CO and [CII] with ALMA. In addition to providing tight constraints on gas masses, SF efficiencies, kinematics, and PDR models, these observations will reveal the fundamental relationship between molecular gas and star formation (`Kennicutt-Schmidt law) on ~kpc scales. Critically, they will also allow us to test how well [CII] correlates with the cold molecular gas reservoir probed with CO. This is imperative, as [CII] will be the main line for studying the star-forming ISM at even higher-z. These detailed case studies, which are only now becoming possible with ALMA, are an essential complement to larger statistical studies of individual tracers and integrated properties.',\n"," 'Tracing the reionization epoch with ALMA. Recent exiting results have shown that up to z=6 (just a billion years after the Big Bang) star forming galaxies have [CII] emission comparable to the low redshift metal poor galaxies; however at earlier epochs (z=7) the sceario is much more confused, with some indications that the [CII] emission from star forming galaxies is considerably below the epectation for a given SFR. Understanding how the properties of primeval galaxies evolve at these early epochs is crucial, since they are probably the key players in the process of reionization We propose to use ALMA to detect and map [CII]158 micron line in a representative sample of bright galaxies in the reionization epoch, for which we have obtained accurate redshifts from the Lyalpha emission line. These galaxies are the brightest is a new sample of high redshift galaxies that we observed with FORS2 as part of an ongoing ESO Large program. Our observations will be deep enough to either detect unambigously the [CII] line, or to set deep lower limits such that we will be able to conclude with no doubts that the properties of galaxies have evolved considerably in the time between z=7 and z=6.',\n"," 'Dust Trapping in the Substructures of Protoplanetary Disks: A Pilot Program at 3 mm. Substructure in protoplanetary disks is fundamental to allow the transformation of disk material into planetary systems. Theory predicts that without substructure in the gaseous disk component, large solids are lost due to radial drift, impeding planetesimal and planet formation. If disk inhomogeneities exist, they create localized pressure enhancements that can effectively trap drifting solids, evolving the particle-size distribution to include large grains. This idea can be tested observationally, by spatially constraining the distribution of solids of different size at high spatial resolution. In Cycle 4 we were awarded an ALMA Large Program at 1.3mm to study substructure in 20 protoplanetary disks. These upcoming observations will constrain the spatial distribution of ~1mm particles down to 6AU scales. Here we propose ALMA 3 mm observations with matched spatial resolution and sensitivity for a subset of 4 bright disks. This proof-of-concept program will probe particles 3 times larger in size, allowing us to constrain the particle-size distribution in ~6-10AU scales, and test if particle trapping occurs in the small-scale substructure of protoplanetary disks.',\n"," '[CII]line emission in a normal galaxy at z=7.36. One of the most outstanding questions in galaxy evolution today corresponds to the formation of the first galaxies during the epoch of cosmic reionization. A key step is to identify and secure spectroscopic redshifts for these galaxies. Here, we propose to use ALMA to unambiguously confirm the most significant [CII] line emission candidate at z=7.360, discovered in our ALMA 1.2-mm spectroscopic survey of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). These 1-hr on-source observations will allow us to set the record distance for [CII] line emission in a normal galaxy, and enable detailed studies of the ISM well into the reionization epoch. It is now the ideal time to conduct these observations, while in compact configuration. Waiting for confirmation in cycle-4 would put this exciting discovery, and potential follow-up observations (higher resolution imaging, other spectral line diagnostics), to halt for at least 1.5 years.',\n"," 'Central Mass Accumulation in Dense Cores and the Origin of the Circumstellar Disk. When dense cores contract or collapse, mass will accumulate at the core centers. Furthermore, angular momentum will shape this mass into flattened structures that feed growing protostars. Theoretical studies of this early epoch have called the larger, non-Keplerian structures that arise \"circumstellar accretion regions\" (CARs) or \"pseudodisks\" and the smaller, Keplerian structures \"early disks.\" These studies, however, have been never constrained by actual observations because previous interferometers have not had the combination of mass sensitivity to detect small-scale (~100 AU) structure within dense cores. We propose with ALMA to observe Band 7 continuum emission from 5 dense cores each on the brink of star formation, to detect these flattened structures at high mass sensitivity (1-5 x 10^-4 Msun) and high linear resolution (90-200 AU). These data will be further supplemented by simultaneous observations of the dense gas tracers H2D+ 1_10-1_11 and N2H+ 4-3, to explore the kinematics and chemistry of these dense precursors to disks. Together, these data will reveal the central accumulation of mass and characterize the origins of disks for the first time.',\n"," 'Nature of the pre-brown dwarf core Oph B-11. The origin of brown dwarfs (BDs) is an important astrophysical mystery because its solution can also shed light on how a broad range of objects, from typical stars to giant planets, are formed and gain their masses. Using the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) at 93 GHz, we have recently identified the first bona-fide example of a pre-brown dwarf core, a self-gravitating starless condensation of gas and dust in the brown-dwarf mass regime (André, Ward-Thompson, Greaves 2012, Science, 337, 69). Given the current uncertainty in its radius (< 460 AU) and mass (~20 MJup), this object (Oph B-11) may even turn out to be the precursor to an isolated planetary mass object. Our result tends to support models according to which BDs form in a similar manner to normal stars, from the direct collapse of a prestellar core. We propose ALMA Cycle 1 observations in Band 3 (93 GHz), Band 6 (220 GHz), Band 7 (370 GHz), and Band 9 (670 GHz), in order to obtain robust measurements of the size, structure, mass of Oph B-11, and constrain its levels of rotation, infall, outflow motions. Such measurements may serve as benchmarks in future surveys for pre-brown dwarfs in nearby clouds, which will be necessary to assess whether most BDs originate from ultra-low-mass cores such as Oph B-11.',\n"," 'Lensing Through Cosmic Time: ALMA Constraints on \"Normal\" Galaxies in the HST Frontier Fields. We propose ALMA Band 6 imaging (FWHM=1.3\", 0.35mJy @5sigma) of the first 4 massive strong-lensing clusters in the HST Frontier Fields, leveraging their >5-10 magnification to study high-z galaxies over the inner ~4 arcmin^2. These clusters have a wealth of ancillary ground/space-based radio-to-X-ray imaging, 1000s of high-quality spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, and exceptional lensing-mass models. Yet these important targets lack strong submm constraints. Our observations will allow (1) a probe of the 1.1mm number counts and luminosity function ~5-10x below published estimates, (2) individual and statistical characterization of high-z star formation via SED fitting/stacking of 10s-1000s of high-z galaxies and source reconstructions, (3) dust continuum constraints on the lensing cluster galaxies and ICM, and (4) a critical benchmark for future lensing-related projects with ALMA. The proposed data will inform us about how star formation proceeded in the early universe. This proposal is a large extragalactic Chilean key project with broad community support and funding, and considerable international expertise (including many on the CLASH science team).',\n"," 'Gauging Deeply Hidden Nuclei of Arp 220. [This project asks for ~120 min of on-source time on Arp 220. See Tech. Justification.] We propose high-precision measurements of putative Compton-thick AGN/starbursts in the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220. We will use the new 1 km baseline to measure the ~0.1\" sizes and ~100 K surface brightness temperatures of the twin nuclei at their dust photospheres. We will then obtain the bolometric luminosity generated within the ~50 pc submm-thick core of each nucleus using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The dynamical masses of the nuclei will also be measured using Doppler velocities of molecular lines from around the nuclei. The luminosity-to-mass ratios and luminosity densities measured this way will constrain the nature of the luminous nuclei because these parameters have lower upper limits for starburst than for AGN. In addition, the highest-ever resolution in the submillimeter observations toward the merger is expected to reveal non-trivial shape, structure, gas motion including outflows, and extreme ISM properties of the nuclei. Our observations will make initial steps of comprehensive ALMA studies on merger-induced evolution of galaxies and their activities.',\n"," 'Understanding the Formation of Globular Clusters. In Cycle 0 observations, we identified an extraordinary molecular cloud with the properties required to form a globular cluster (including size and mass). The lack of associated thermal radio emission indicates that star formation has not yet altered the environment, and places this cloud at a very early stage of evolution. Given the extremely short lifetime expected for this phase of cluster evolution (< 1Myr), we expect clouds such as this to be exceptionally rare, which is reflected by the fact that this is the only such cloud identified in the ALMA Antennae data set. Thus, we have the opportunity to determine the physical conditions in a proto-globular cluster molecular cloud -- before these conditions have been disrupted by star formation -- for the first time. With this proposal we seek to determine the resolved physical conditions in this cloud, constraining possible formation mechanisms. We propose ~0.1\" (=10 pc, 5x better than the Cycle 0 observations) imaging of this singular molecular cloud in 12CO(2-1), 12CO(3-2), 13CO(2-1) to determine its basic physical properties including mass, size, linewidth, and temperature.',\n"," 'A high-resolution look on [CI](2-1) and CO(7-6) in 2 lensed SPT galaxies: extended gas reservoirs or compact starbursts?. Characterizing the gas reservoirs of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) is essential to determine if their impressive star formation rates are either due to their extended gas reservoirs or to compact starbursts. With the APEX/SEPIA instrument, which includes a prototype of the ALMA band 5 receivers, we observed a sample of lensed DSFGs from the SPT survey in [CI]2-1. This line is an alternative to CO to trace the gas, which is optically thin, not destroyed by cosmic rays, and less affected by the CMB. These observations revealed a large scatter of the ratio between [CI](2-1) and CO(7-6), which traces dense excited gas and is observed simultaneously. These results suggests very diverse ISM properties across our sample. To understand the origin of the [CI](2-1) and CO(7-6) emission and the nature of these galaxies, we propose a 5-h pilot program to observe our two most promising sources at high resolution (0.3 arcsec). With these data, we will: a) map the gas and dust in these two objects; b) study the variation of ISM conditions inside them; c) produce high quality lensing models and test the presence or not of differential lensing; d) determine their dynamical properties.',\n"," 'Filament and high-mass star formation triggered by tidally-driven colliding HI flows in the LMC. Recent observations confirmed that filamentary structures are widespread across the Galactic molecular clouds and massive filaments are supposed to be precursors of high-mass stars. Although large-scale colliding flow may be a promising event to form such filaments, the idea is not well constrained observationally. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a suitable target to investigate the effect of galactic-scale kinematics thanks to its nearly face-on view. Recent ALMA observations toward a few particular objects in the LMC found that there are massive filamentary clouds within a possible compressed layer, which is originated from HI colliding flows induced by the last tidal interaction between the Magellanic Clouds. Our detailed HI analysis shows that the same compressed velocity components are almost ubiquitous in the other active star-forming regions in the LMC. In this new program, we will carry out survey-type observations toward these regions to search for massive filamentary clouds and investigate the environmental dependence of their properties. This is the first comprehensive exploration to study the relation between the low-density HI flows and high-density CO filaments.',\n"," 'The Home Straight - CO Redshifts of Herschels Brightest SMGs. These observations are the final step towards finishing the redshift catalogue of 207 bright, high-redshift Herschel sources (S500 > 80 mJy, z_phot > 2). Extensive redshift searches have already robustly identified 77% of the redshifts, and using all knowledge up until now, we propose efficient ACA observations to find the redshifts for the remaining 48 galaxies using band 3, 4, and 5. Sample completion will enable unbiased spectroscopic follow-up across all sources, and provide a complete picture of cosmic star-formation seen by Herschel at the peak of cosmic evolution. These final observations of 48 galaxies require 124 hours, and fall in three separate categories; 1) we efficiently target lines to resolve redshift-degeneracies, 2) we observe fainter galaxies with deeper integrations, and 3) we cover the redshift desert for sources with deep integrations that did not reveal any line signatures.',\n"," 'Dense Gas and Starburst/AGN Activities in the Late-stage IR-Bright Merger VV114. Numerical simulations have demonstrated the importance of galaxy collisions and mergers in triggering massive bursts of star formation in the host galaxies. Recent high resolution simulations that include an improved treatment of the multi-phase ISM have shown that star formation not only increases as the galaxies first collide, but it also persists at a higher rate throughout the merger process, peaking at the final coalescence. An observational test of gas response requires mapping both the diffuse and dense gas tracers in merging U/LIRGs at high spatial resolution. Here, we propose Cycle 0 ALMA observations to obtain 0.5-1.6\" (200-640 pc) resolution maps of a gas-rich late stage merger VV114 in HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3), 12CO(3-2), 13CO(3-2), 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) lines. The relative proximity, -17 deg declination, and the rich array of multi-wavelength (HST/Spitzer/Chandra/VLA) complementary data make VV114 a particularly good target for the Cycle 0 ALMA investigation. By analyzing the new ALMA data with 5 times higher angular resolution and 10 times improved sensitivity over the existing data, we aim to map the distribution and kinematics of dense molecular gas and the dense gas mass fraction and interpret the dense gas properties and their relation to star formation and AGN activities in the context of the merger-induced response of the ISM in the progenitor disks. These new observations will allow us to characterize the gas properties of this galaxy pair that is known to harbor an AGN and have extended starbursts across the galaxy pair, likely evolving to a ULIRG in the future.',\n"," 'Probing the extremes of the cloud-scale dense-gas star formation relation. There is great interest in complementing detailed studies of the initial conditions of star formation in local (Galactic) Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) with observations of GMCs in nearby galaxies, to probe a wider range of environmental conditions. Beyond observations of molecular transitions of CO and isotopologues, ALMA is enabling resolved observations in nearby galaxies of molecular transitions with high critical densities. This is particularly relevant for HCN(1-0), since it is integral to the empirical dense-gas star formation relation, a correlation with the star formation rate (SFR) that has been observed both locally and for entire galaxies. Recently, it has become clear that in local GMCs, our understanding of HCN excitation is complicated by the presence of HCN emission beyond the highest densities, on scales of several pc. To study the resolved dense-gas star formation relation and look for such extended HCN emission, we propose to target 3 massive GMCs in M33 whose SFRs could hardly be more different, including the extreme HII region NGC 604 and quiescent GMC-8. Previous pc-scale ALMA data in 13CO(2-1) guide and enable the detection of HCN (and more) on these scales.',\n"," 'Evolution of molecular clouds associated with O-type YSOs in giant molecular clouds in the LMC. This proposal aims at observing the brightest 40 high-mass YSOs, whose luminosity is a few 10^4 to 10^6 Lo, in the Large Magellanic Cloud in order to investigate the evolution of high-mass protostars in terms of the properties of the surrounding material. Our Cycle 1 observation toward N159W/E detected many features related to high-mass star formation; molecular outflows detected in 12CO(2-1), an indication of cloud-cloud collision as a formation mechanism of high-mass YSOs, the dense gas dissipation, the detection of radio recombination lines, and so on. These are thus found to be good tracers of the evolutionary status of high-mass YSOs and of the effect of the YSOs to the surrounding environments. The target lines we use are 12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1), C18O(2-1), 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0), CS(2-1), SiO(5-4), H30alpha, and H40alpha as well as in continuum in Band 6 and Band 3. Analysis of the proposed gas/dust data in combination with our expert knowledge of the LMCs high-mass YSO population and molecular gas distribution on larger scales will allow us to identify the conditions that lead to high-mass YSO formation and estimate the dissipation timescale of the progenitor clouds.',\n"," 'ALMA Observations of the Most Luminous Young Stellar Object in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We propose to probe the dense circumstellar environment of the most luminous young stellar object (YSO) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and among the most luminous forming stars detected in any galaxy. Our recent Herschel Space Observatory key program HERITAGE performed a uniform far-IR survey of the LMC, and using these observations we identifed thousands of YSOs in the LMC, including the proposed target, which we have determined to have a total luminosity of approximately 10^6 L_sun, making it the most luminous forming star in the LMC. To understand how stars with such tremendous masses form, we must observe them during their short-lived formation stages. We propose band 3 ALMA observations of this massive YSO of CO, 13CO, C18O, HCO+, HCN, and 1 mm continuum to 1) determine its multiplicity, 2) accurately determine the physical properties of the star-forming clump/core(s) (masses, densities, line widths, etc.), and 3) measure the feedback from the massive star into the surrounding medium. We will use 12CO to trace the high velocity, low density outflow, while C18O, 13CO, HCN, and HCO+ will be used to trace the low-velocity, high-density gas perturbed by the wind.',\n"," 'Detailed Physical Properties of the Interstellar Medium in a z=5.2 Dusty Starburst (Completion). Studies of the interstellar medium (ISM) at high redshift have progressed tremendously in the past years, but studies of the physical properties based on a suite of fine structure lines (which are critical for studying the earliest cosmic epochs, where CO is faint due to decreasing metallicity) are still in their beginning stages. We here propose to complete our in-depth study of the ISM based on six CNO fine structure lines in a massive starburst galaxy at redshift 5.2 (where all lines fall into a \"sweet spot\" in the atmosphere), allowing us to push these studies back to the first billion years of cosmic time. This will allow us to measure the fraction of [CII] emission that originates from the neutral vs. ionized medium, the density of both the neutral and ionized medium, the effective temperature in HII regions associated with star-forming clouds, and the O/N abundance ratio. This study will detect fine structure lines up to rest-frame wavelengths of 52 micron in one of the most distant starburst galaxies known, making it an ideal demonstration case for the ALMA band-10 receivers.

The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) will soon (December 2021) open a new window to the Universe through high-energy polarization. Here we propose high-frequency monitoring of IXPE blazar targets. The proposed observations will supplement our planned multiwavelength campaign in radio, optical, X-rays, and gamma-rays. Measurement of the mm-optical-UV-X-ray continuum spectra of blazars in conjunction with X-ray polarization will provide the data needed to determine, for the first time, the mechanism and location of the X-ray emission, as well as test particle acceleration models in blazar jets.',\n"," 'Skimming the Surface: An Absorption Study of HDO in a Young Protoplanetary Disk. Cold water vapor revealed by energetic UV photodesorption of icy mantles in the outskirts of protoplanetary disks provides a unique view into the composition of their largely invisible ice reservoir. Surface water (H2O) emission has been detected via this mechanism, however interpretation requires uncertain excitation modeling to derive a column. Based upon our Herschel PACS observations of water towards the young and inclined protoplanetary disk, RY Tau, we find that the data are strongly suggestive of deep unresolved self-absorption. We propose an experiment to measure HDO in absorption against the dusty continuum to determine the column density of cold HDO vapor and thereby obtain the first estimate of the D/H ratio in a young planet-forming disk with ALMA. If this photodesorbed layer is representative of the ices themselves, which grow and settle out over time, we are directly probing the composition of the gas that becomes incorporated into planetesimals, comets, etc., i.e. the building blocks of planetary systems. Such observations will provide important constraints on the initial HDO/H2O ratio of disk ices down to Earths ocean-levels (VSMOW) and potentially lower.',\n"," 'Carbon fractionation at redshift z=0.89. Isotopic ratios are powerful probes of the nucleosynthesis history of a galaxy, and the spectroscopic study of absorption lines toward bright background continuum sources provides a powerful technique to investigate them. Such absorption studies require a foreground galaxy in the line of sight to e.g. a quasar, and the most famous such system is the molecular absorber at z=0.89 towards PKS 1830-211. A range of isotopic ratios have been measured in this galaxy, and they are found to differ significantly from ratios in the Milky Way. However, potential fractionation has not been taken into account. Models show some molecules are more vulnerable to fractionation, such as CO, HCN, and HNC. Other molecules, such as CN and HCO+, are expected to reflect the true isotopic ratio. In order to study the 12C/13C fractionation in the molecular absorber at z=0.89, we will target the carbon-bearing molecules HCN, HNC, HCO+ and CN, and their 13C isotopologues. We will constrain the level of fractionation in the gas and derive the true 12C/13C isotopic ratio. This will also allow us to use previously measured double ratios to extract the isotopic ratios 14N/15N and 16O/18O.',\n"," 'A legacy survey of Wolf-Rayet star winds. The powerful and highly ionized winds of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars emit free-free radiation and recombination lines from the radio to near-IR. Despite being bright at sub-mm wavelengths, few suitable observations have been made in the gap between radio and near-IR wavelengths to characterise the wind properties and compare with models. We propose to use ACA in Bands 3 and 6 (92 and 263GHz) to build a catalogue of mm/sub-mm spectral indices and flux densities of the winds of 57 of the brightest Galactic WR stars. This will be used to identify potential new high-frequency calibration sources for ALMA (to increase the number of phase calibrators available for high frequency bands), investigate statistical trends and compare with wind emission models, and use to select sources and plan future high spatial resolution imaging of the wind morphologies. The catalogue and images will have a strong legacy value to the evolved massive star community.',\n"," 'High-mass disk formation and fragmentation. Understanding the fragmentation and rotation properties of disks around young high-mass stars remains one of the key questions in star formation research. The unique capabilities of ALMA allow us to probe the physical properties of the gas and dust in the inner envelope and disk region around the central high-mass star. Specifically, using the long baselines in the 1.3mm band result in a spatial resolution of ~0.05, allowing us for the first time to resolve the predicted fragmentation scales on the order of ~100AU. Therefore, we propose to observe one of the best 10^5 Lsun high-mass disk/outflow candidates G351.77-0.54 at 230GHz in continuum and spectral line emission. Important questions which these observations will address are: What are the fragmentation properties of this massive disk candidate? Are the kinematic properties of the disk-like structure of Keplerian nature dominated by the central object or still strongly influenced by a flattened envelope? Are outflow properties, e.g., possible outflow rotation, directly linked to those of the accretion disk?',\n"," 'Occultation of the radio galaxy J1513-4221 by the asteroid (61) Danae. Occultations of radio sources by asteroids provide an effective method of determining asteroid sizes and positions at the moment of the observation. The method is based on the modelling of diffraction fringes using the Fresnel-Kirchhoff theory. We propose to use ALMA to determine the size of asteroid (61) Danae, and to confirm, or disprove, the suggested existence of a moon around this asteroid. The orbit of the eventual moon around the primary body can be used to constrain the mass and the density of the asteroid. So far the statistics about these parameters are poor for these kind of asteroids. Here we wish to utilize the fortuitous occultation of the radio source J1513-422 by Danae that will be observable at ALMA on July 18, 2019.

Super star clusters (SSCs) are consistent with being the progenitors of globular clusters, so understanding the conditions of their formation provides insight into star formation during the era of galaxy assembly. To understand the environment and conditions of SSC formation, it is essential to observe the earliest stages that are only observable at mm wavelengths, before stars form and disrupt the natal material. Johnson et al. 2018 identified a population of molecular clouds that may have the necessary properties to form SSCs in Henize 2-10, a dwarf starburst galaxy with several well-studied SSCs, but this data had too low a resolution to confirm them. This population includes clouds at a range of formation stages, including several with no associated thermal radio emission, indicating that massive star formation has not yet begun. Our proposed observations and non-LTE fitting technique will constrain the masses, sizes, temperatures, densities, substructure, and kinematics of these clouds. We will be able to confirm if this population has any pre-SSC clouds and compare the SSC formation process in a dwarf starbust to other environments, such as the major merger Antennae galaxies.',\n"," 'A Comprehensive [CII] Survey of Herschel-Selected Starbursts at z=1-2.

In combination with the rich suite of diagnostics already available, this study will provide critical insight into the physical properties of the ISM that set the conditions for star formation for a statistically significant sample. Based on >10 systems in the sample for which <=1kpc resolution [CII] imaging with the ALMA 12m array is available, the ACA data will also provide a critical test for the potential presence of low surface brightness emission on >10kpc scales due to an enriched cold circum-galactic medium missed by high-resolution studies, as has been suggested to exist in star-forming galaxies in the early universe by some recent theoretical work.',\n"," 'Detection of Extragalactic Millimeter-Wavelength Transient Sources with SPT-3G. Experiments designed to survey the cosmic microwave background provide a unique opportunity to study the time-variable sky at millimeter wavelengths. The first results from the SPT-3G transient detection pipeline have yielded two long-duration transient (LDT) events with timescales of 2-3 weeks each and flare amplitudes of 4x and 15x their quiescent fluxes. These transients appear to be associated with WISE galaxies at photometric redshifts of z = 0.37/0.68 and z = 0.97. Current observational evidence would be compatible with low-luminosity jet-dominated AGN flares or tidal disruption events, though the extreme flare variability and lack of radio detection makes them peculiar. In this proposal, we are asking for ALMA Band 3 measurements in order to establish accurate positions for the two LDTs.

Jets and outflows are the most obvious signposts of ongoing star formation, when the accretion during the Class 0 phase powers bipolar ejections perpendicular to the forming disk.

This proposal aims at getting the first complete picture of the interaction, morphology and kinematics of outflows within such a protostellar system. We target IRAS 16293-2422, one of the best-studied Class 0 systems. It consists of a protobinary (Source A and B), separated by 600AU. Source A is also a binary system with a separation of 36AU. Our aim is to fully resolve all known sources and their outflows in both the velocity and spatial domain to understand the interplay between the outflows, the ambient medium and the forming stars. To pursue that goal we target CO(3-2) and 13CO(3-2) - to get the full dynamics of the outflow - CS(7-6) and C34S(7-6) - to get the infall motions towards the sources, and the dynamics of the dense gas in the disk - and SiO(8-7) - a shock tracer to understand the interaction of the outflows with the quiescent gas.',\n"," 'The first detection of the [OIII]88um from Two QSO host galaxies in the reionization epoch.

The objects have the highest [CII]158um line luminosities among QSO host galaxies at z>=6.0, making them the best targets for follow-up observations of [OIII]. We aim the first [OIII] line detections from QSO host galaxies at the reionization epoch. With the line ratios of [OIII]/[CII], we examine ionization parameters of host galaxies. In addition, our dust continuum data will allow us to place strong constraints on dust temperature and on dust masses. Our proposal will allow us to perform systematic comparisons of ionization parameters and dust properties between QSO host galaxies and star-forming galaxies at the reionization epoch, highlighting the difference or similarity between the two galaxy populations.',\n"," 'Revealing the 12C/13C ratio across the galactocentric radius through sensitive absorption detection. It has long been proposed that the 12C/13C isotopic ratio can be used as a diagnostic for the evolutionary stage of stars and galaxies. The current Galactic 12C/13C gradient by Milam et al. (2005) has been frequently used in various astrochemistry works. However, their work does not consider the contribution from CMB temperature, and the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation used in their analysis is not suitable for millimeter wavelengths. Correcting for all of these effects, we found that the values of 12C/13C ratio are up to 50% smaller than the previous ones. We propose here to measure the 12C/13C ratio through sensitive absorption observations toward five quasars. Each of the sightline has more than three velocity components, which trace gas components at different spiral arms. With the proposed sensitivity, we will be able to measure the HCO+/H13CO+ ratio at different galactocentric radii. Our aims are: 1) to reveal the Galactic 12C/13C gradient through this independent measurements, 2) to measure the fractionation effect on the 12C/13C ratio in diffuse clouds, and 3) to measure the photodissociation effect on the 12C/13C ratio.',\n"," 'The dark side of the Web of the Giant.

This approach has proven to be superior in terms of redshift precision and time investment to optical spectroscopy with 8-10m class telescopes. With the proposed sensitivity, we will secure [CII] detections in all targeted sources that belong to the overdensity, and expect to triple the number of known LSS members. This will i) tremendously improve our knowledge of the overdensity level, volume and mass of this unique structure, and ii) allow the first statistical study of the physical properties (total SFR, dust mass, and possibly dynamical mass) of its member galaxies.',\n"," 'The Shape of Things to Come: Planetary Influence on the Inner Edge of the Closest Debris Disc. Epsilon Eridani is the 3rd nearest Sun-like star to our Sun and the nearest one known to host a debris disc. This proximity makes it a prime system for understanding dynamical interactions between planets and a disc. In cycle 2 we observed the northern part of its debris ring and resolved the width of the ring for the first time, finding it to be just 13 AU wide. Based on the narrowness of the ring, we proposed that a planet of around 0.4 Jupiter masses is likely located at 48 AU. We also noticed low level emission just interior to the main belt that could either be described by a steeply rising inner edge of the belt or an extra component just interior to the main belt. In order to determine more precise parameters of this planet and understand how it is interacting with the ring, we propose to image the entire ring with 6 pointings in order to determine the shape of the inner edge of the ring and use this to predict the mass and location of the outermost planet in the system. By observing the whole ring, these observations will also allow us to constrain the eccentricity of the ring, which can in turn constrain the eccentricity of the outermost planet.',\n"," 'Disks, winds, and tori -- towards a comprehensive view of the AGN environment with VLTI and ALMA. We explore the origin of dusty molecular outflows in AGN by combining data from the highest angular resolution IR and sub-mm facilities VLTI and ALMA. Using VLTI we recently showed that the \"dusty torus\" region is much more complex than models assume: Radiation pressure may drive a clumpy wind that forms a polar outflow. This outflow seems responsible for the bulk of the mid-IR emission seen on <10 pc scales of nearby Seyfert galaxies and may be the origin of kpc-scale molecular outflows invoked in AGN feedback. While this disk+wind picture emerged from detailed VLTI observations, it lacks an exploration of its physical implications: dense molecular gas orbits the black hole and dense clouds are ejected into the outflow. In this pilot study we will observe NGC 3783, the poster child of the pc-scale \"dusty outflows\", by mapping the kinematics of high-density tracer lines HCN(4-3), CO(3-2) & CO(4-3), CS(7-6), and HCO+(4-3). Do we see the dense rotational disk? Can we prove a significant outflow? And does the IR dust emission trace the high-density regions? These questions can only be solved directly with the unprecedented exploitation of maximal angular resolution of ALMA and VLTI.',\n"," 'First characterisation of a multi-planetary system at the stage of formation. Many questions regarding planet formation are still open, in particular how material is accreted from the protoplanetary disk onto the forming planet through its circumplanetary disk (CPD). PDS 70 is a unique source to investigate such processes as it hosts two planetary companions within an inner cavity. These sources, PDS 70b and c, were robustly detected with SPHERE (infrared) and MUSE (Halpha). The analysis of ALMA Band 7 observations, at an angular resolution of 70 mas, indicates continuum emission at the location of the planets and represents the very first detection of a CPD. However, higher resolution observations at 30mas are required to confirm the presence of these two CPD and spatially resolve the CPD around PDS 70c from the edge of the continuum ring. In addition, substructure within the dust ring and a peak of CO emission offset from the bulk Keplerian profile strongly suggests the presence of a third companion of the disk. The requested observations would also allow for the characterization of substructure within the dust ring, required to confirm the presence of a third companion.',\n"," 'Search for Interstellar Pyrimidine. Many interstellar complex organic molecules are known to be prebiotically important and have essential functions in terrestrial biochemistry. Pyrimidine, the building block of nucleic acid, has been detected in meteorites and is hence a key molecule for astrochemistry and astrobiology. Given the fundamental importance of interstellar pyrimidine, we thus propose to observe nine most favorable pyrimidine bandheads and five strong low-J doublets in the Orion KL hot molecular core with ALMA in Band 7. Although the formation of prebiotic molecules in extraterrestrial environment and their contribution to the origin of life remains unsettled, the connection between interstellar organic chemistry, meteoritic pyrimidines, and the emergence of life on early Earth would be strengthened with the discovery of interstellar pyrimidine.',\n"," 'Linking the Resolved Filamentary Molecular ISM to Massive Star Formation across M33. Milky Way studies show that the molecular ISM is filamentary on few pc scales, including recent discoveries of large-scale galactic filaments, but coarse resolution in extragalactic observations has stifled direct comparisons beyond the Milky Way. We propose observations to enable this comparison with complete mapping of M33s inner star-forming disc (25 kpc2) to resolve filamentary molecular clouds on 4 pc scales, down to masses of 900 Msol (5-sigma). We will efficiently detect widespread 12CO & 13CO(2-1) to (1) identify how galactic structure shapes the molecular ISM morphology in different environments (centre vs. spiral arms vs. inter-arms); (2) trace molecular clouds from formation to dispersal, building a resolved view of the molecular cloud lifecycle; (3) resolve whether filamentary morphology influences where massive star form, testing predictions from competing star formation theories. This survey enters a new regime in molecular cloud studies by resolving similar scales to Galactic plane surveys across a complete external star-forming disc. Combined with HST, VLA, and Cycle 1 JWST observations, these data will be a definitive legacy product for molecular cloud studies.',\n"," 'CK Vul: Unravelling a 350-year old mystery. The nature of CK Vul is a complete mystery.

ALMA will add an important piece that will help us to complete the CK Vul jig-saw puzzle.',\n"," 'Unveiling the outflow mechanisms in transitional millisecond pulsars: the ultimate observing campaign of PSR J1023+0038. The discovery of three millisecond pulsars that swing between an accretion and a rotation powered state has challenged our comprehension of the evolution of accreting neutron stars in low mass X-ray binaries. We are coordinating the most extensive ever, strictly simultaneous, multiband campaign of the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038 during its current peculiar X-ray sub-luminous accretion disk state. We propose to observe this system with ALMA simultaneously with other telescopes to: i) assess whether the mm emission displays similar variability as observed at lower frequencies; ii) determine the spectral slope in the radio-mm-near infrared domain to probe the presence of a jet (and determine its properties) and to gain insight into the role of a putative pulsar wind in driving radio flares. The ALMA observations will be crucial to nail down conclusively the connection between mass accretion and ejection in this system and in the transitional millisecond pulsars in general. This ultimate campaign will advance our knowledge on the details of the process by which neutron stars evolve from the initial accretion state to the final rotation-powered radio pulsar state.',\n"," 'The Formation of High-Mass Binaries and Their Accretion Disks. High-mass stars (>8Msun) are preferentially found in binary systems. So far, there are no definitive observational constraints to identify which are the dominant physical mechanisms explaining the binarity of high-mass stars: core fragmentation, disk fragmentation, and/or multiple-body interactions. At the same time, the evidence of (Keplerian) accretion disks around high-mass stars is growing. However, no systematic study at the required spatial resolutions to resolve disks (<100 au) have been carried out. Based on the experience gained in a pilot survey and taking advantage of the unique ALMA capabilities, we will statistically (1) test the scenarios that explain the binarity of high-mass stars, and (2) search and characterize accretion disks around high-mass stars. Using dust continuum at ~230 GHz and including several tracers of disk kinematics (hot core, salt, and recombination lines), we will observe a uniform sample of 71 high-mass star-forming regions between 2 and 3 kpc, reaching an unprecedented spatial resolution (~50 au). We estimate to unveil ~100 binaries containing massive young stellar objects (MYSOs), factor 5 larger than in the pilot survey.',\n"," 'Water BEARS. We propose a comprehensive study of water lines in the brightest sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) on the Southern sky from the Bright Extragalactic ALMA Redshift Survey (BEARS), more than tripling the number of H2O detections in SMGs, in order to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and test for drivers of starburst mode vs main sequence stellar mass assembly in the ramp-up to Cosmic Noon. Water is the most abundant molecule in star-forming galaxies after H2 and CO, and is an important coolant of warm gas with line luminosities comparable to CO. The H2O transitions are driven by pumping from far-IR photons, so the H2O line luminosities correlate linearly with far-IR luminosity and are hence the best tracer of SFR over >3 orders of magnitude. The H2O and CO line profiles are very similar, and resolved CO and H2O studies show they are co-spatial, implying that gravitational lens magnifications derived from CO morphologies can be applied also to H2O lines, and that differential magnification between H2O and CO can be neglected.',\n"," 'Protostellar Multiplicity in Isolation. Multiple star systems are a common outcome of star formation. While the multiplicity frequency and separation distribution are well-characterized for field stars, theoretical studies predict that the majority of multiple systems form very early in the protostellar phase and undergo significant and rapid dynamical evolution. Thus knowledge of the intrinsic multiplicity fraction and separation distribution before modification via dynamical evolution requires studying the youngest objects: protostars still embedded in and accreting from their parent cores. Recent surveys have made great progress in characterizing protostellar multiplicity in clustered environments but have left unanswered a key question: does the formation of multiple systems depend on environment? Here we propose an ALMA band 6 multiplicity survey of 31 truly isolated protostellar cores down to approximately 25 AU resolution in order to measure the protostellar multiplicity fraction and separation distribution in isolated globules and determine the effects of environment on fragmentation.',\n"," 'Breaking the Degeneracy - Robustly constraining dust temperatures in z~5 galaxies with Band 9 observations. Measuring the evolution of the dust temperature (Tdust) in star-forming galaxies is key to understanding how their dust, interstellar medium, and obscured star formation properties changed across cosmic time. While dust temperatures of nearby and moderately high-z galaxies are well constrained, at z > 4 we are still limited to Tdust values based on stacks of galaxies (which are hard to interpret), or from single sources with dust spectral energy distributions (SED) that do not detect the peak - the most sensitive part of the SED to changes in Tdust. Our goal is to detect for the first time the peak of the dust SED in two main-sequence galaxies at z~5 using Band 9. These targets already have the rising portion of the SED detected from Bands 6, 7 and 8. Our proposed Band 9 observations will add the key missing point required to obtain robust dust temperatures, which will translate into reliable measurements of the infrared luminosity, obscured star formation activity, and dust properties of normal star-forming galaxies at z~5 - all fundamental in the context of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Black Hole Masses, central parsec gas dynamics, and Event Horizon Detectability in a sample of nearby galaxies. Resubmission: 2 galaxies delivered. 6 remain to be observed in Cycle 4. Despite it now being well established that nearly all galaxies have a central black hole whose mass scales with the host galaxy properties, we do not have a complete understanding of the physics at work. In particular, we do not know whether black holes, or galaxies, drive the scaling relations. Although we know that the M-sigma and M-L relations are incompatible in the largest galaxies, we do not know which is wrong. We are now at the limits of what can be learned with ~80 data points with substantial measurement uncertainties, and urgently require additional precision data. ALMA is capable of measuring black hole masses at high precision in a large sample. We propose observations of a modest pilot sample of nearby galaxies in order to: (1) Measure black hole masses in 3 new sources with large angular spheres of influence, (2) measure the central parsec gas dynamics in most or all 8 sources allowing us to better understand the systematics in molecular line black hole mass measurements, and (3) determine suitability for event horizon shadow resolution with the Event Horizon Telescope.',\n"," 'Weighing Low Mass Black Holes in the Nearest AGN. We propose to use ALMA to make the first robust dynamical detections of ~10^5 solar mass central black holes in two nearby galaxies. These measurements will provide constraints on the formation of black holes in the early universe, and on the physics underlying galaxy -- black hole scaling relationships. Our targets are two active galactic nuclei (AGN) at D < 5 Mpc, and both show clear evidence from near-infrared observations of rotating molecular disks surrounding their black holes. The high resolution of ALMA will enable us to significantly improve on existing black hole mass measurements of these galaxies.',\n"," 'Quantifying the cool gas reservoirs of a benchmark sample of radio AGN: CO(1-0) observations of the 2Jy sample. Observations of the cool gas are crucial for understanding the triggering of luminous AGN and the impact they have on their host galaxies. ALMA opens a new window on the cool ISM in AGN via sensitive observations of the CO emission lines. Here we propose to use the most compact configurations of ALMA to make deep CO(1-0) observations of a complete sample of 29 luminous radio AGN at low-to-intermediate redshifts (0.05 < z < 0.3) for which we have already obtained multi-wavelength data of unprecedented depth and completeness from X-ray to far-IR wavelengths. The observations will be used to: (a) quantify the molecular gas contents of the host galaxies and thereby estiablish whether the triggering mergers are gas-rich or gas-poor; (b) investigate the causes of the observed diversity in AGN properties for a given radio power; and (c) determine whether the feedback effect of radio jets directly influences the star formation efficiencies in the host galaxies. As well as filling a key gap in our understanding of how radio AGN tie in with the evolution of massive early-type galaxies, the observations will also provide an important low-z benchmark for high-z studies of cool gas in AGN.',\n"," 'Completing 2.6-mm and 1.3-mm spectral scans toward the prototypical Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. We propose ACA stand-alone spectral scans in the 2.6-mm and 1.3-mm bands toward the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. This galaxy shows prominent molecular gas concentrations along the grand-design spiral arms and bar-ends (Starburst Ring) and around the AGN (Circumnuclear disk), and thus an ideal laboratory to study the impact of AGN and star formation on the host galaxys ISM and their interplay through mm/sub-mm lines. Because of its close distance (~13.7 Mpc) and the clear AGN/starburst contrast, NGC 1068 is one of the most studied extragalactic system with molecular lines. Indeed, ALMA has been observing this galaxy every cycle from cycle 0 that results in extremely rich ALMA 12m array archive in Band 3 and Band 6. However, lacking short spacing data (i.e., ACA) have a strong impact on the line flux measurements. This is critical in the context of astrochemistry because it prevents from measuring accurate line fluxes, i.e., column densities, from region to region of NGC 1068. The purpose of this proposal is to complete the Band 3 and Band 6 spectral scans by adding short-spacing information.',\n"," 'When the Very Large Telescope is not large enough: spectrosopic identification of z~4 massive galaxies. We have recently built the ALMA Redshift 4 Survey, 870um observations of 100 galaxies at z=4, selected solely from their stellar mass in the deep CANDELS fields. These exquisite data allowed us to constrain the star formation mode of massive galaxies in the early Universe, and we will further investigate their dust attenuation properties and star formation geometry in future works. However, the main source of uncertainty is the derivation of the redshifts, based on the UV-to-NIR broadband photometry. The ALMA detections show very red SEDs, and many lack a strong break from which the redshift can be reliably guessed. NIR spectroscopy with the VLT (KMOS) was obtained with 6h on-source integration: no emission line was found. At this stage, the only way to obtain the spectroscopic identification of these objects is to target sub-mm lines, and ALMA is the most efficient tool to achieve this. As part of a pilot program, we propose here to observe 3 of our brightest galaxies and scan CO lines with an original and efficient setup to unambiguously determine their redshifts. In addition to its obvious legacy value, this program will pave the way for future more extensive campaigns.',\n"," 'Are the most massive z >4 galaxies hidden from HST ?. Our current understanding on the cosmic star formation history at z > 4 is primarily based on UV-selected galaxies. A critical question is then whether we are missing a significant population of massive, UV-faint galaxies. By crossmatching HST/WFC3 and IRAC data in the three CANDELS-Herschel fields, we perform a systematic search of galaxies which are bright in IRAC but are not detected in the WFC3 H band, i.e., H-dropouts, which are likely at z > 4 where the H band probes the rest-frame UV. In total, we identify 64 H-dropouts down to [4.5] < 24, corresponding to M*~10^{10.8} Msun at z > 4. Both photometric redshifts and stacked infrared SED suggest that most of them are at z > 4, with LIR~2*10^{12} Lsun. These galaxies likely represent 30-40\\\\% of the most massive galaxies at z > 4, but were completely missed in previous studies based on either UV or near-infrared selected samples. An ALMA 870 um census is crucial to confirm individually that they are high-redshift dusty sources, and explore star formation properties for this unique sample, which is essential to have a complete understanding of massive galaxy formation in the first 1.5 Gyr of the universe.',\n"," 'Searching for Overdensities around z~5 Quasars in [CII] and Dust Continuum. Hierarchical structure formation predicts the highest-redshift quasars to exist in regions of massive overdensities as the earliest progenitors to galaxy clusters.

We will (1) map continuum-subtracted quasar fields and perform a search for line detections around the quasar, and (2) search for evidence of an enhanced environment by comparing continuum detections with the submillimeter number counts in the literature and Lya searches for overdensities.',\n"," 'Toward Resolving the Magnetic Flux Problem in Star Formation: Mapping Poloidal B-field in Edge-on Disks. Poloidal magnetic field is expected in protostellar disks, if magnetic flux is dragged into the disks from star-forming dense cores. Such a poloidal field can play a key role in disk evolution and jet launching. However, direct evidence for its existence has been lacking. Here, we propose to follow up on our previous project to resolve the B-field morphology and search for poloidal field in the young, edge-on, and resolvable disks in two nearby disk-jet systems, HH 212 and HH 111, using polarization observation of thermal dust emission. If detected, it would mean that some of the core magnetic flux is indeed dragged into the disks and the poloidal field can indeed play a key role in both disk evolution and jet launching. A negative result would cast serious doubt on the poloidal-field driven disk evolution and jet launching. It would also imply that the long-standing ``magnetic flux problem is somehow resolved at large distances beyond the disks. To have the best chance of polarization detection, we request 2 Science Goals in Band 7 at 345 GHz at 0.035\"-0.04\" angular resolution. If succeeded, we would produce the first maps of poloidal B-field in young disks.',\n"," 'Disks and complex organics in the inner regions of low-mass protostars. One of the key questions that ALMA will address is how circumstellar disks form around low-mass protostars and how their physics and chemistry evolve until the planet-forming stages. We here propose to observe a range of transitions from isotopologues of common molecular species (H13CO+, C34S) and of complex organic molecules tracing the inner few hundred AU of two embedded low-mass protostars. These observations will address two coupled questions about low-mass star formation prompted by recent ground-based submillimeter interferometric observations: what is the origin of complex organic molecules around low-mass protostars and when are rotationally supported disks formed around such sources? This is made possible with the angular resolution and sensitivity offered by ALMA in its extended array in cycle 0. A key facet of these observations will be the spatial resolution and the sensitivity to reveal emission from complex molecules and relate those to the density distribution and kinematical profile revealed in H13CO+ and C34S on few hundred AU scales.',\n"," 'Investigating the impact of the most powerful outflows known. We propose high-angular resolution band-6 observations of the CO(7-6) line and continuum emission in two dusty-obscured quasars at z=2.4. These quasars are currently driving the fastest, most massive ionized outflows at galactic scales known so far with velocities up to 7000 km/s. Recent low-resolution ALMA observations also reveal large-scale (~20 kpc) cold gas halos around these quasars, likely created by outflows. Observations with a spatial resolution of ~850pc will enable us to map the dense molecular gas and dust in the quasar host galaxies and test whether the fast outflows really deplete gas and dust in the nuclear region within 2 kpc from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as expected by recent cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. The CO(7-6) observations will also be used to quantify the impact of outflows on the gas kinematics and SMBH growth. Given the remarkable outflow properties, evidence for feedback in action should be observed in these quasars.',\n"," 'ALMA survey of coronal magnetic activity of supermassive black holes in nearby Seyfert galaxies. AGNs host hot plasma, namely coronae, emitting intense X-ray photons. Like the Sun, these coronae are believed to be heated by their magnetic activity. However, coronal magnetic activity in AGNs have never been measured. Utilizing ALMA Cycle-4 observations (#2016:1:01140:S), we have successfully detected coronal radio synchrotron emission from a nearby Seyfert galaxy IC 4329A. This discovery has been first achieved by ALMAs high angular resolutions and sensitivity at the millimeter bands. The inferred magnetic field strength is of ~10 Gauss on scales of ~40 Schwarzschild radii from the black hole, which are key parameters for understanding of corona heating and jet launching. Here, we request ALMA Band-3, 4, and 6 observations toward nine Seyferts in order to establish the ubiquitousness of coronal magnetic activity in Seyferts. By establishing the existence of coronal synchrotron emission with this survey, ALMA will open a new observational window for the study of AGN accretion physics. We also request two epoch observations toward each target at the Band 3 to see the time variability. Variability measurements will enable us to constrain the size of the emitting region.',\n"," 'Molecular gas chemistry in radio galaxies: the impact of radio jets in NGC 3100. Spatially-resolved studies of multiple molecular line transitions are powerful tools to investigate the impact of radio jets on the physics and kinematics of the surrounding gas, and nearby objects are exceptional laboratories for this kind of analysis. Such studies are however very sparse and mostly focused on Seyfert galaxies. We propose a multi-species, spatially-resolved study of the radio galaxy NGC 3100 (z~0.009). From previous ALMA Cycle 3 12^CO(2-1) observations in Band 6 we detected a well-resolved disc of 1.6x0.45 kpc^2. The CO disc appears disrupted along the jet axis and hints of non-circular motions (i.e. outflow) are observed along the disc minor axis. These findings make NGC~3100 a best candidate for a detailed jet-cold gas interaction study. We ask to observe other two CO transitions in Band 3 and 7, as well as dense (HCO+ in Band 7) and shock (SiO, HNCO in Band 4) gas tracers. Through these observations we will characterize the physical conditions of the different kinematical components of the molecular gas in different regions of NGC~3100, and assess the impact of the radio jets on the kinematics and chemistry of the immediately surrounding environment.',\n"," 'Spatial constraints on the cold dust in the shell around the AGB star V644 Sco. We propose to observe the shell around the carbon AGB star V644 Sco with the ACA in bands 6 and 7. In spatially unresolved observations with LABOCA on APEX towards V644 Sco, we detect a similar excess flux also detected in the shell around the AGB star R Scl. The submm observations towards R Scl are spatially resolved, and indicate that the excess flux originates from a cold dust component with large grains at 30 K, possibly revealing a large reservoir of dust mass from AGB stars. The lack of spatial constraints for V644 Sco severely limits the interpretation of the APEX data. The ACA observations will spatially resolve the shell around V644 Sco. They will effectively constrain the grain properties in the shell around this star by measuring the spectral index in the submm. The proposed observations offer a unique opportunity to study the contribution from AGB stars to the total galactic dust budget. If the large grains are confirmed also in V644 Sco, it would imply that our view on dust production in the Galaxy would have to be adjusted.',\n"," 'Scrutinizing a dense molecular torus in the archetypal AGN NGC 1068. We propose ALMA 0.012\" (<1 pc)-resolution band-7 (275-370 GHz) HCN J=4-3 line observations of the nucleus of the nearby (14 Mpc) archetypal luminous AGN, NGC 1068. Previously obtained ALMA data of HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 lines in band 6 (211-275 GHz) clearly revealed a long-sought-after east-west-oriented, rotating dense molecular torus in NGC 1068. However, it was also found that the dense molecular torus looks counter-rotating between inner and outer part, much more complicated than a classical torus picture. We aim to better scrutinize a cloud-collision scenario toward the western torus from the far side, by combining the proposed high-angular-resolution HCN J=4-3 line data with existing data. Our ultimate goal is to obtain an important clue about how to fuel a central supermassive black hole in the luminous AGN population, by removing angular momentum in the torus.',\n"," 'Water cycles: tracing D/H in an embedded protostellar disk. The D/H ratio of water vapor has long been used as a key fingerprint to trace the origin of Earths water. However, the overall understanding of water D/H in the solar system is uncertain. The classical paradigm indicates that deuterium fractionation is temperature dependent, which predicts an overall radial gradient (low D/H close to the star and higher values at greater distances). This gradient may be imparted on forming solar system solids. However, recent work shows plausible mechanisms for local deuterium enhancement. A pilot study of the HOPS-370 protostar and its disk offers a simple opportunity to test this theory. This source has a kinematically isolated 100 au disk as inferred from ALMA observations, along with NOEMA detections of H218O, HDO, and CH3CN (priv. comm.). The latter molecule is an excellent probe of the temperature. We propose to use ALMA and resolve the disk with multiple beams inside the water snowline to search for radial gradients in the water D/H ratio.',\n"," 'Molecular gas associated with the LMC Supernova remnants. We propose molecular gas observation of three supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The LMC offers a unique opportunity for studying SNRs because we can see objects without distance uncertainty and confusion by foreground or background material. We have selected three SNRs that are similar with our Cycle 2 observed SNR (N132D in the LMC) in X-ray morphology but the age and luminous bands are different. The primary goal of our ALMA observation is to detect defuse molecular slumps around these SNRs at resolutions higher than 1 pc. With this resolution, we will reveal the relation with thermal/non-thermal X-ray enhancement with shock interaction by comparing clumpy molecular gas with filamentary X-ray of Chandra. We will clarify the universality of X-ray emitting mechanism around the SNRs by compare the results of three SNRs with N132D, and the galactic studies.',\n"," 'A Challenge towards the First Detection of Interstellar Glycine. We propose to observe G10.47+0.03 with five lines of Glycine (NH2CH2COOH) in band4. We have found that G10.47+0.03 has the richest abundance of methylamine (CH3NH2), a precursor to glycine, whose abundance is about one order of magnitude higher than that in SgrB2(N). Since the observed abundances of CH2NH and CH3NH2 can be well explained with the model by Garrod (2013), the first detection of glycine would be plausible with the brightness temperatures of about 160mK, based on the predicted abundance of glycine by Garrod (2013). G10.47+0.03 shows narrower linewidth than SgrB2(N), smaller probability of line contamination would be expected. Once successful, we will be able to open a new era of astrochemistry and astrobiology in that many researchers would join in finding other amino acids and\\\\/or other prebiotic molecules.',\n"," 'Investigating grain growth in a structureless protoplanetary disk. Substructures acting as dust traps in protoplanetary disks are the currently accepted solution to the fast radial drift of mm/cm-sized grains, which would otherwise deplete the disk of large grains quickly and prevent planet formation. A puzzling source in this context is the evolved (3-17 Myr) protoplanetary disk around the nearby (100 pc) solar analog MP Mus: despite its age, 1.3 mm archival ALMA observations do not reveal any substructure down to 6 au scales. Here we propose to obtain 3 mm observations with a similar angular resolution to investigate whether large grains are present in the disk. Combined with the existing 1.3 mm data, this will result in a spatial map of the disk spectral index (sensitive to grain sizes), enable detailed modeling of the dust properties and disk structure, and allow us to search for substructures at optically thinner wavelengths. If large grains are found in the disk, then very small ($<6 au) unresolved substructures may be responsible for stopping their migration. On the other hand, if only small grains remain, this could imply than planets need to form much faster than expected before mm-sized grains disappear from the disk.',\n"," 'The Dynamics of the 200au Disk in the O-Type Protostar G17.64+0.16. At the very highest resolution available to ALMA (20mas) we imaged the continuum emission, finding an elongated structure, the dust disk, around G17.64+0.16 in Cycle 5. Now we wish to image deeper to detect the molecular line emission and study the dynamics. G17.64+0.16 is thought to be a proto-O-star (>10^5Lo) and we confirmed it is surrounded by a cold dust disk, in agreement with multi-baseline IR interferometry indicating a hot dust disk. In protostellar models, G17 is in a late phase, contracting from a swollen configuration to a main-sequence configuration with a radiative stellar envelope now driving a wide angle `disk wind. Our Cycle 2 data indicate that SiO is tracing this rotating disk-wind (similar to Orion Source I). We have detected, and resolved the disk in the continuum emission but we do not detect SiO at the highest velocities. We wish to map much deeper to understand the dynamics of the disk from the resolved molecular line emission - this will allow us to (1) confirm the O-star nature from the velocity pattern, (2) investigate for the presence of a binary, (3) Provide insights into te spiral features - due to gravitational instabilities or a binary.',\n"," 'Feeding and feedback in an unbiased and representative sample of AGN in the local Universe. We will map CO(2-1)in the central 3 Kpc of a representative and unbiased sample of 34 AGN in the Local Universe (D=10-50Mpc), from the 12µm all-sky sample. This is crucial to quantify the global AGN feeding and feedback and measure the time-averaged impact of these processes-the key unknown in theories of galaxy evolution. We will detect molecular outflows down to 10^5 Mo, derive outflow rates, gas reservoir masses and depletion timescales for the entire population of local AGN. We will identify the gravitational torques driving infall, and measure inflow rates. With the continuum maps we will measure dust masses, sizes and gas/dust ratios in the nuclear disks. We will observe 22 bright AGN in 27 hours which, when added to ALMA archival observations, will provide a sample of 34 AGN (14 Seyfert 1 and 20 Seyfert 2). We will compare these with archival ALMA maps of a similarly selected sample of LINERs. The legacy value comes from combining uniform CO maps for a relatively unbiased well-studied sample of bright AGN. We will identify the most suitable bright nearby AGN for ALMA high-resolution follow-up to dynamically constrain their black hole masses.',\n"," 'The molecular gas in post-starburst galaxies. We propose to make the first spatially resolved CO imaging observations of two post-starburst E+A galaxies. These galaxies are unique because they show no signs of active star formation, but still contain large reservoirs of neutral hydrogen gas as evidenced by our own GBT and JVLA observations. Observational evidence indicates that the E+A phenomenon may, in part, mark the transitional phase between star-forming disk galaxies and quiescent spheroidal systems, and there is growing consensus that these galaxies are the result of galaxy mergers. Mapping the molecular gas in these galaxies will resolve the puzzle of why these galaxies have truncated their star formation - the molecular phase is most directly related to star formation activity. By studying the distribution and dispersion of the CO gas we can learn whether the gas is stable against the formation of dense molecular clouds. Also, the distribution and kinematics of molecular gas in E+A galaxies can reveal recent gravitational interactions. Counterrotating gas, which is sometimes seen in elliptical galaxies, is a clear indication that the gas has an external origin.',\n"," 'Last equatorial flows in axial PNe, effects of a binary stellar system. Studying the appearance and properties of bipolar winds is critical for understanding the stellar evolution from the AGB to the planetary nebula (PN) phase. Many uncertainties exist regarding the presence and role of binary stellar systems. M 2-9 is a young PN with very elongated bipolar structure, that singularly yields direct information on its central stellar system. In the equator, rings detected in molecular line emission show unprecedented positional and dynamical imprints of the presence of a binary system. From those, a mass ~< 0.2 Msun was proposed for the companion of the central post-AGB star. If the presence of such low-mass companions can trigger the shaping of very elongated lobes, this would strongly supports the binary-based models. Here we propose to observe 12CO J=3-2 and 6-5 line emission to dig more deeply into the peculiar kinematics identified in the equatorial rings in M 2-9, and thus better characterize the properties of the binary system. We want to study in detail the excitation conditions of these last winds, the suggested presence of shock dynamics, and of inner warmer components, and the relation between the bipolar outflows and the equatorial rings.',\n"," 'Blowing in the Wind: Temporal Variability of Titans High-Altitude Circulation System. ALMA observations of Titan in 2016 and 2017 revealed the presence of a surprisingly fast, strongly time-variable zonal wind/jet encircling the equator at high (thermospheric) altitudes. This unexpected discovery presents a major challenge for our understanding of how momentum is transported throughout the atmospheres of terrestrial-like planets. Here we propose multi-epoch, high resolution Doppler wind measurements of HNC, HC3N, CH3CN and C2H5CN in Titans mid-to-upper atmosphere, to provide maps of the wind velocity field in four dimensions (latitude, longitude, altitude and time). This data will allow us to (1) determine the intrinsic cadence (and magnitude) of temporal variability in Titans zonal winds, (2) investigate the origin, evolution, and stability of the newly-discovered thermospheric jet, and (3) by comparison with new and state-of-the art climate models, determine the detailed mechanisms responsible for high-altitude energy and momentum transport, and their impact on the observed wind speeds. This work will to pave the way towards a new understanding of seasonal variations in the dynamics of rapidly rotating, terrestrial-like planetary atmospheres.',\n"," 'On the origin of [CII] in the Epoch of Reionization. One of the most controversial results on the study of distant (z>6.5) galaxies is the number of faint [CII] detections (including many non-detections) with ALMA. These findings indicate very diverse ISM conditions in primordial galaxies. Here, we propose to gain insight into the ISM state of the [CII]-emitting gas in a `normal (SFR~20 Msol/yr) star-forming galaxy at z=6.8 with a bright [CII] detection, using Band 5 observations to measure [NII]205mum. We will derive constraints on the L_[CII]/L_[NII] luminosity ratio, which will reveal if the fine-structure line emission in this galaxy is HII or PDR dominated. We aim to provide insight into the so-called `[CII] deficit in galaxies during the Reionization era by unveiling the ISM conditions that give rise to bright [CII] emission in this galaxy in the same epoch.',\n"," 'H3O+: Are the clouds in the central 50 pc of NGC 253 exposed to the X-rays from a black hole?. We propose to use ALMA to image the ortho-H3O+ transition at 396 GHz with a resolution of a few pc toward the starburst galaxy NGC253. This is the only submm line of H3O+ which is not affected by dust radiation pumping and will therefore be an excellent tracer of density. In contrast with the other submm lines that can be excited excited at low densities by dust emission, the 396 line will trace the high temperature, high density clouds with high ionization fraction in the nucleus of NGC253. The combination of the 396 GHz line images with those already obtained with ALMA of the para-H3O+ line at 364 GHz will provide the densities over a wide range (from few 10^3 cm-3 to 10^7 cm-3) and reliable H3O+ abundance of the clouds in NGC253. The spatial distribution of H3O+, its abundance and the densities will be used to establish the local origin (UV, X-rays and/or cosmic rays) of the enhanced ionization rates. In particular, we will explore the possibility that clouds within 50 pc of the center of NGC253 show the enhanced H3O+ abundance expected if they were affected by the X-rays from an intermediate mass black hole as suggested by the observed X-ray emission with Chandra.',\n"," 'Towards a complete sample of z~7 dusty starbursts. Using data coming from the ongoing S2COSMOS survey (a deep SCUBA2 map of the COSMOS field at 850um) we have uncovered a population of 28 Extremely Red Starbursts (ERS) with very red SCUBA2-to-SPIRE colors that suggest redshifts z > 6. This allows us to study the very-high-redshift tail of the SMG population with a statistically useful sample for the first time (only one dusty starburst has been confirmed to be at z > 6 up to date, HFLS3 at z = 6.34). We propose to carry out continuum observations in B8 and B6 to confirm the red FIR/submm colors of our ERS, pinpoint the positions of the sources, obtain FIR photometric redshifts, derive the number density of z>6 dusty starbursts and feed galaxy formation and evolution models, which generally predict that this population must have tremendously decreased at z > 4.',\n"," 'The emergent low-mass cluster B59: how to beat magnetic fields. B59 is the only star-forming site in the quiescent and magnetized Pipe nebula. It contains a small cluster of low-mass protostars and a very twisted magnetic field in comparison with the more pristine regions of the cloud. We propose to perform a detailed dynamical study of B59 using linear polarization observations. These data will reveal the magnetic field morphology in sources in B59 wich are at distinct evolutionary stages: Class 0, I and II. We want to trace the evolution of the magnetic field properties in the three stages. We expect to resolve the field morphology at the dust envelope of Class 0 objects and at the circumstellar disks at Class I and II objects. Since all targets belong to the same (low-turbulent) parental cloud, we will be able to test predictions of magnetized molecular cloud models. As a complement, molecular line data will trace the kinematics of the cores in order to better constrain the possible ambiguity of projection effects in the polarization data.',\n"," 'Can the passage of a radio jet compress the molecular gas in a galaxy?. Gas compression is a requirement for jet-induced star formation. We aim to test whether the passage of a radio jet leads to the compression of the molecular gas it encounters in an ideal target: the nearby elliptical IC5063, in which a jet propagates through a disk. Using ultra-deep SINFONI observations, we demonstrated that the jet unambiguously accelerates atomic & molecular gas along and perpendicularly to its trail. The gas velocities exceed ordered motions by 600-1200 km/s near four different bending points of the jet. The entrained/scattered gas extends far, sweeping the galaxys inner square kpc. Having a map of the outflowing molecular gas at high temperatures from SINFONI, we now aim to create a map of the outflowing molecular gas at high densities from ALMA, in order to identify regions of high pressure. In these regions, we will investigate whether the ISM is more or less prone to star formation. We request CO(1-0),(3-2), and (4-3) observations to run CO excitation models and obtain a density map. To directly probe the high-density regime and constrain the models, we request HCN, HNC, HCO+(1-0) and HCO+(4-3) observations.',\n"," 'Dissecting starbursts at z=3.6 through multi-line H2O imaging. Submm multi-line H2O studies provide a unique probe of the densest starburst regions of ULIRGs where they measure the local IR radiation field. Strong gravitational lensing boosts ALMA sensitivity and angular resolution, enabling comprehensive studies of these sources with H2O lines at z~4. The impact of such multi-line H2O observations much benefits from combination with simultaneous high\\xadresolution imaging of the far-IR dust emission and CO lines, as shown in the SV observation of the prototypal source SDP81. Our IRAM/PdBI detection of H2O in 16 high\\xadz lensed galaxies has shown that strong H2O emission is ubiquitous in high-z ULIRGs. As in local ones, our modeling shows that it originates from highly obscured IR\\xadluminous regions. We have selected the best source with high-excitation H2O emission at z=3.63 for a new step of our ALMA high\\xadz H2O project. We will observe 5 H2O lines providing the full diagnostic power of H2O, in 3 tunings in standard ALMA modes. Mapping the FIR continuum and CO(6-5) at 0.25\" will provide details of the source structure at 500pc resolution in the source plane, relating H2O emission and excitation to the overall structure and dynamics of the gas disk.',\n"," 'Multi-phase outflows in ULIRGs: Mapping the massive cold component. Using H2 2.12micron integral-field spectroscopy (IFS), we have recently characterized the hot molecular component of massive outflows in local IR bright starbursts. In particular, high velocity (~1000 km/s, FWZI) hot molecular outflows extended over 2-3 kpc regions have been identified in three low-z ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Based on our previous works (Emonts+14, García-Burillo+15), we predict total cold molecular outflowing masses of ~10^8 Msun and outflow rates of 15-200 Msun/yr. Here we propose to obtain deep 0.35\" CO(2-1) images of these three ULIRGs to: (i) map the massive cold molecular phase of the outflows; (ii) establish the mass loading and momentum boost factors; (iii) and, for the first time, determine the multi-phase (cold/hot molecular and ionized) sub-kpc structure of the outflows in the most extreme local star-forming galaxies.',\n"," 'Resolving water emission and dust temperature in the early universe. We propose spatially resolve dust temperature and infrared luminosity in three strongly-lensed starforming galaxies at z~3 from the SPT survey. With the aid of gravitational lensing, we will achieve kpc spatial resolution in the source plane in B9 with 0.5 arcsecond angular resolution. The B9 continuum observations will enable us to spatially resolve the L_H2O/L_IR correlation and dust temperature in galaxies at high redshift for the first time. These observations will provide a powerful constraint on the kinematics of the FIR field and help understand the relation between star formation and star formation potential at high redshift. The water observations have already been conducted in Cy 3 & 4 and the result has been published in ApJ. Here we are requesting 49 minutes in Band 9 to complete the continuum imaging portion of the project. (This exact proposal was given an A-ranking in Cycle 5, but never observed.)',\n"," 'Do z~2 quasar-driven outflows really suppress star formation?. Despite two decades of model predictions that the most luminous AGN (i.e., quasars) can have a significant impact upon the star formation in their host galaxies, the observational results that directly confirm these claims are limited and are usually very speculative. However, ``direct\" evidence for star formation suppression have been presented using IFU data for three z~2 quasars. In all three objects, these data show an anti-correlation between high velocity ionised outflows and the unobscured star formation, as traced by [O III] and narrow H-alpha emission respectively. However, our recent work combining high-resolution ALMA continuum emission, tracing obscured star formation, with tracers of unobscured star formation (such as H-alpha) has highlighted the dangers of interpretations on the total star formation in the absence of obscured star formation constraints. Here we propose an observational test to the often-cited claims of star-formation suppression, by obtaining deep 870um ~0.3\" resolution continuum maps to trace the obscured star formation in these three quasars.',\n"," 'First Detection of a Prebiotic Molecule in a Protoplanetary Disk. Complex organic molecules (COMs) are seen throughout the solar system and the ISM. However, the number of COMs detected in protoplanetary disks, the sites of planet formation, remains small. This is because the typical protoplanetary disk is too cold for most COMs to exist in the gas phase. Yet chemical models predict dust grains in disks to be active sites of COM ice chemistry. Heating events, such as those in FUor objects, can increase the disk temperature, sublimating COMs. Recently, ALMA detected five COMs in the disk of the FUor object V883 Ori. Here, we propose to use ALMA in spectral scanning mode to detect glycolaldehyde (CH2OHCHO) in V883 Ori. Glycolaldehyde is a prebiotic molecule, a precursor to sugars and, under Earth-like conditions, RNA. Glycolaldehyde was easilty detected as part of the PILS survey of the IRAS 16293 protostellar envelope and should be similarly bright in the V883 Ori disk. This program will achieve the first detection of a prebiotic molecule in a protoplanetary disk, providing observational constraints on complex chemsitry in planet forming disks.',\n"," 'The physical conditions and spatial structure of the dust formation zone of IRC+10216. We propose to study the innermost zone (1-20 R*) of IRC+10216 through the systematic observation of a significant number of vibrationally excited lines of abundant species such as HCN, HNC, SiO, SiS, SiC2 and CS. The highest angular resolution of ALMA band 6 (0.02\") is requested to resolve the stellar photosphere and the region of a few stellar radii where dust molecular seeds are formed, and where shocks could be controlling the chemistry and the dynamics of the envelope. The physical conditions across the dust formation and growth zone (1-20 R*) will be fully characterized using lines from vibrationally excited states up to 15000 K in energy. We expect to obtain a unique data set from which the physical conditions and spatial structure of the gas across these inner regions will be derived. In addition, we will trace the presence of shocks, and unveil the recent mass loss history of this prototypical C-rich AGB star. These observations will also provide strong guidelines for astrochemical models, and laboratory experiments on the properties of stardust analogues.',\n"," 'The Evolution of Molecular Outgassing in Distant Comet C/2017 K2: A Joint ALMA/JWST Monitoring Campaign Across Ice Lines. We propose ALMA Cycle 8 observations of the distantly active Oort cloud comet C/2017 K2. These observations will provide crucial information regarding molecular abundances and outgassing in support of approved JWST Cycle 1 and planned JWST Cycle 2 observations targeting K2. The overall scientific goal is to observe K2 at multiple heliocentric distances (rH) both pre- and post-perihelion, following K2 to the distant reaches of the solar system. These measurements will trace the evolution of molecular activity as K2 crosses the ice lines - the rH at which sublimation of each volatile species activates (6-8 au for CO, 2-3 au for H2O). Our objectives are to quantify the abundances and spatial distributions of CO, H2CO, CH3OH, CS, HCN, and HNC over a range of rH, including before and after the coma is dominated by H2O production. These data will enable a transformative and detailed investigation of the evolution of cometary activity as a function of primary driver (H2O or CO), providing a comprehensive record of the progression of activity from the outer to the inner solar system and yielding fundamental insights into coma dynamics and activity across a perihelion passage.',\n"," 'Characterizing Ios atmospheric composition and circulation v3. Jupiters moon Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system and has a very thin and spatially variable atmosphere, mainly composed of SO2. The goal of this proposal is to adress several aspects of the atmosphere that are not well characterized : the nature and abundance of the minor species, the replenishment sources for SO and SO2, and the atmospheric circulation (wind). To bring unprecedented constraints on these questions, we propose to observe a rich portion of band 7 with the extended configuration and a fine spectral resolution. The excellent available sensitivity will allow to search for expected yet undetected volcanic species such as KCl, S2O, SiO and CO, for which the abundance measurement will put strong constraints on the volcanic regimes. Simultaneously, the strong lines of main species SO2 and SO will be mapped with an improved spatial resolution, with the objective to relate their spatial distribution to their possible respective replenishment mechanisms. Finally, we will measure Doppler-shifts on the strongest line to retrieve the best observation of the atmospheric wind-field. Ios atmosphere circulation has only been observed once so far, and the proposed ALMA observations are expected to provide a radical improvement on the wind measurement.',\n"," 'Magnetic field in the vicinity of central black holes in 3C273 and 3C279. Multifrequency VLBI polarimetry is the best tool to probe the strength and structure of the magnetic field in the inner jets and in the extreme vicinity of supermassive black holes. We propose here to use the GMVA+ALMA observations of 3C273 and 3C279 in combination with our planned RadioAstron observations at 22 GHz in order to obtain the most detailed picture of polarized emission distribution and Faraday rotation measure in these objects on scales down to 20-30 microarcseconds. The phased ALMA will be crucial for improving the r.m.s. noise and structural sensitivity of the 86 GHz images, which will enable probing the rotation measure in regions with much weaker polarization signal and much steeper spectral index. Combined with the information on jet spectrum, opacity, and collimation, the polarization and rotation measure imaging will enable reconstructing the three-dimensional distribution of the magnetic field and making a founded judgement on its origin and the exact role in formation and acceleration of relativistic flows in AGN.',\n"," 'Monitoring Post-Flare Protoplanetary Chemistry with ALMA. High energy radiation from young pre-main sequence stars is one of the main drivers of the physical and chemical evolution of planet-forming disks. Traditionally, stellar radiation is assumed to be relatively constant over the course of millions of years, but in reality, young stars are incredibly dynamic. For example, X-ray flares can increase the ionization within the circumstellar disk by several orders of magnitude. Flares may play an important role in determining the long-term composition of planet-forming regions, but the direct effect of an X-ray flare influencing chemistry in real time has not yet been detected. This proposal aims to do just that. This Target of Opportunity will be triggered by Chandra observations of the Orion Molecular Cloud, where we will measure flare driven enhancement and decay of HCO+ isotopologues in four protoplanetary disks. Disks will be selected based on flare strength, known millimeter emission, and visual extinction. This set of observations will directly measure electron recombination timescales, and therefore the ionization and electron abundances, in a protoplanetary disk.',\n"," 'The [CII] Line Study of a Star-forming Galaxy in the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization. Detecting galaxies from the local to the highest redshift Universe, including the epoch of cosmic reionization at z > 6, and characterizing their star formation activity and physical properties are obviously a key issue to understand the formation and evolution of galaxies as well as disentangle the relationship between the diverse populations of galaxies. While star formation and dynamics of low-z galaxies have been well studied using the CO lines as a tracer, those of high-z galaxies have not due to its faintness.Meanwhile, the ionized carbon 158 micron [CII]line can be a powerful alternative to detect high-z galaxies, because it is the strongest cooling line of ISM in galaxies and observable at submm/mm when redshifted to z >6. The ALMA can detect high-z [CII]line only in a few hours and resolve galaxies in this line emission on a few kpc scales, enabling to probe obscured star formation and constrain the sizes, the dynamical masses and ISM in early star-forming galaxies at the epoch of reionization for the first time.Here, we propose the ALMA [CII]line observation of a star-forming galaxy at z >6. We particularly propose to target a z = 6.96 galaxy IOK-1, because it is one of the spectroscopically confirmed highest-class redshift objects in the epoch of reionization and we have a lot of information about this galaxy that can be compared with the ALMA observation. Using IOK-1 as a probe, we will (1) reveal the relation between high-z and local star-forming galaxies, (2) estimate obscured SFR at z~7, (3) investigate the morphology, dynamics and physical properties of a z~7 galaxy, (4) to constrain the physical states of ISM in a z~7 galaxy.',\n"," 'ALMA Study of the Hyperluminous SMGs Identified from Planck All-Sky Survey. We have identified 31 hyperluminous SMGs with apparent IR luminosity of ~10^14 solar luminosity by selecting candidate high-z sources from the Planck Catalog of Compact Sources and by examining their characteristic dust SED and multi-wavelength photometric properties. They are verified to be high-z sources by detecting 1mm dust continuum and one or more CO lines using the Large Millimeter Telescope. Our ongoing HST/WFC3 imaging program has shown that the majority are strongly lensed SMGs by a foreground massive galaxy or galaxy cluster. Here, we propose to image 16 Planck SMGs using ALMA in the same CO transitions and 1mm continuum detected by the LMT in order: (1) to confirm the AzTEC & RSR detections and to map the location, spatial extent, and kinematics of gas (CO) and and to analyze their relation to SF (1mm continuum) activity and stellar light traced by our HST/WFC3 imaging; (2) to derive the magnification factor and in turn the intrinsic luminosity and masses; and (3) to identify the best candidates for future high resolution, high sensitivity study that will lead to an in-depth exploration of SF and gas physics at 10 to 100 pc scales via gravitational lens modeling.',\n"," 'Observations of the [CII] Emission Line in Hot-Dust Obscured Galaxies. The WISE mission has recently identified a rare population of high-redshift, hyper-luminous infrared galaxies, all with bolometric luminosities above 10^13 L_Sun, and many exceeding 10^14 L_Sun. Characterized by their extremely red mid-IR colors and very hot dust temperatures, these hot, dust obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) likely probe a key stage in the galaxy evolution paradigm. The bulk of the IR emission in Hot DOGs is powered by AGN activity, outshining possible fainter cold emission associated to star formation. The only way to study the ISM properties of the host galaxy in these objects, as well as the effects of the AGN on it, are through kpc-scale imaging of the dust and gas at sub-mm wavelengths. We propose here to use ALMA to obtain deep, high-resolution observations of the 157.7um [CII] emission line and of the FIR continuum in a small sample of carefully selected Hot DOGs to constrain the physical properties of the their dust and gas components and gain insights into their star-formation properties.',\n"," 'Evolution of ISM in Star-Forming Galaxies at z = 1 - 5. We propose to measure the ISM contents of 180 galaxies at z ~ 1.15, 2.2 and 4.8 -- sampling both the normal star-forming galaxy main sequence and the starburst population with IR luminosities elevated up to 20 above the main sequence. The sample is stellar mass selected at 0.3-4x10^11 solar masses. The ISM masses will be determined from ALMA Band 7 & 6 continuum observations which measure the long wavelength, optically thin dust emission -- this technique has major advantages compared to CO line measures: avoidance of the CO conversion factor issues (i.e. dependence on excitation conditions -- temperature, density and metallicity) and much greater speed (approximately 10 times faster to the same mass limit). With these ISM masses for statistically meaningful samples, we can determine the gas mass fractions as a function of redshift and stellar mass and also investigate the elevated star formation activity above the main sequence. Is the enhanced activity due to larger ISM masses or enhanced efficiency for conversion of gas to stars?',\n"," 'Sodium Shadows - a new tracer of the coldest gas in cluster cores. The cores of clusters of galaxies are complex environments with both very hot, dense gas and very cold molecular gas that has cooled out from the hot component. Optical emission-line filaments are found in almost all cluster cores where strong cooling is observed in the X-ray. In the past 15 years we have established that cold molecular gas is threaded through this ionised material, and ALMA has shown that the two phases are intricately linked. Recently, however, we have used VLT/MUSE spectroscopy to identify a cold gas filament which is only visible through its narrow NaD absorption lines, projected against the BCG starlight of the low-redshift cluster A3716. Optical line emission is barely detectable even with the high sensitivity of MUSE, perhaps indicating a very low temperature in the cloud. Here, we propose ALMA observations to determine whether there is molecular gas associated with the A3716 \"Sodium Shadow\", and whether the cold gas extends behind the BCG where NaD absorption cannot be observed. The possibility that molecular gas may be present in cluster cores that we have overlooked by relying on optical emission line selection would have far-reaching implications.',\n"," 'Why is star formation boosted from the inside out in low z starburst galaxies?. High spatial resolution maps of stars and gas in nearby galaxies provide vital insight into how stars are form on kpc (and below) scales. Such local studies, such as HERACLES, PAWS and EMPIRE, have shown that star formation depends sensitively on environment, as well as the raw gas reservoir available as fuel. However, these local samples are limited by statistics, and hence do not sample galaxies at the extremes of star formation. We propose to study the interplay between gas and star formation in a sample of low-z starbursts, selected from the MaNGA IFU survey. Although rare in the low redshift universe, local starbursts represent analogs to star formation at high-z, where galaxies were more gas-rich and formed stars at much higher rates than obseved today. We have recently shown (Ellison et al. 2018) that these low-z starbursts are centrally concentrated, building stellar mass from the inside-out. By combining the kpc-scale MaNGA SFR maps with CO maps obtained on the same spatial scale, we will distinguish whether the central starbursts occur due to a simple abundance of molecular gas, or whether they additionally exhibit elevated star formation efficiencies.',\n"," 'Redshifts of bright Herschel ATLAS gravitational lenses. We propose CO redshift measurements of 30 of the brightest (S500m > 0.1 Jy) strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies from the equatorial and Southern fields of the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H\\xadATLAS). These simple observations will double the sample size of H-ATLAS background source redshifts, complementing our long-term 8m-class foreground lens redshift campaigns. Our pioneering lens selection (Negrello et al. 2010 Science) has an astonishing ~100% efficiency and the gravitational amplification makes CO line detection up to ~100× faster than in unlensed surveys. Our proposed redshifts will provide spectroscopic confirmation of gravitational lensing, by finding submm redshifts that are clearly higher than the redshifts of the lensing masses. This on its own is already enough to make statistical constraints on the dark matter halo profiles. Combined with our ongoing multi-wavelength campaigns, we will start placing direct constraints on the evolving dark matter distribution of the lenses. The joint lens\\xadsource redshift distribution is a key discriminator of cosmological parameters and the evolution of dark matter haloes.',\n"," 'How common are extreme molecular haloes around z~2 quasars?. Cicone et al. (2021) reported the discovery of a giant CO(3-2)-line emitting halo extending out to r~200 kpc from a quasar at z~2 selected to have known kpc scale outflow. Such halo was resolved out by ALMA and could only be revealed through fairly deep ACA observations. This molecular circumgalactic medium reservoir may embed a massive amount of molecular gas, and it does not appear to be associated with an overdensity of optical, infrared or sub-millimeter emitters around the quasar. We propose to expand the relevance of this discovery for the field of galaxy formation and evolution by extending the search for massive >100kpc-size CO haloes in additional five z~2 AGN, hosting a wide range of kpc scale outflow properties, using similar deep ACA CO(3-2) observations. The goals of this pilot study are: 1) a first assessment of how common these massive H2 haloes are at z~2; 2) understand the relevance of AGN outflows in the formation of this cold phase of the CGM.',\n"," 'Understanding the role of infrared radiative pumping in ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We propose to obtain the molecular line data of (1) HCN/HCO+/HNC J=2-1, (2) vibrationally excited (v2=1f) J=2-1 and J=8-7 of HCN/HCO+/HNC, and (3) their isotopologue H13CN/H13CO+/HN13C, of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG), IRAS 20551-4250. This ULIRG contains a luminous obscured AGN and shows clearly detectable v2=1f J=3-2 and J=4-3 emission lines of HCN and HNC in our previously taken ALMA data, thanks to small observed molecular line widths. Thus, this ULIRG is an excellent laboratory to estimate how the infrared radiative pumping mechanism affects the observed HCN/HCO+/HNC rotational J-transition fluxes, in addition to the widely assumed collisional excitation. By combining with our previously taken ALMA data for this ULIRG, we will first constrain molecular gas physical properties, and then evaluate how the infrared radiative pumping contributes. Our comprehensive (sub)millimeter molecular line data set of IRAS 20551-4250 will be an invaluable basis to understand the physical origin of the observed (sub)millimeter molecular line flux ratios in AGN-containing ULIRGs from the local to distant universe, whose ALMA observations will routinely be made in the near future.',\n"," 'Hunting for redshifts of faint DSFGs in A2744. We propose an ALMA linescan for 7 secure DSFGs detected in our 1.1 mm cycle 2 ALMA images of Frontier Field cluster A2744. These modestly lensed (u~1.5-4) DSFGs likely lie at z~1-4 and span intrinsic luminosities of log[L(IR)]~11.5-12.3, thus probing a region of phase space that is currently poorly sampled at high redshift. However, their extremely red NIR colors and magnitudes make spectroscopic redshift detection impossible with current instrumentation. These ALMA observations will circumvent the current bottleneck to secure redshifts for all of the targets, allowing firm individual constraints (e.g., SFRs; stellar, dust and molecular masses via SED modeling; excitation ladders; gas depletion times) as well as to characterize and compare the population to previously studied brighter DSFGs and MS galaxies. The requested pointings will also serve to confirm and similarly constrain lower significance sources, detect new fainter line and continuum sources, place useful individual and stacking limits on many field galaxies (a substantial fraction with firm VIMOS, MUSE, and KMOS redshifts).',\n"," 'Testing feedback scenarios and clump life times in a prototypical z~2 galaxy. Theoretical models predict that key aspects of galaxy evolution including bulge formation, black hole accreation and quenching may be regulated by the dynamics of large star forming clumps which are almost ubiquitous in the gas rich ISM medium of normal high redshift galaxies. The effective relevance of this scenario depends on the longevity and the possibility of \"rejuvenation\" of such instabilities, both of which can be observationally constrained by probing the amount and distribution of cold gas at the clump scales. We thus propose for ~8h high resolution mapping of molecular gas content in HUDF 6462, a well studied and typical star forming z~1.5 clumpy galaxy. We target the CO(5-4) emission line in Band 6 using a 0.4\" beam width for resolving individual clumps. The requested frequency range covers the rest-frame 500micron thus also offering the possibility of measuring continuum dust emission. These new ALMA data, combined with the state of the art data set available for the proposed target, will offer strong constraints on the above key questions.',\n"," 'A new, fast, ultradeep constraint on the ISM content of the first generations of massive quiescent galaxies.. The question of whether quenching requires complete gas depletion does not have a clear answer yet. The literature offers contrasting results, whose intepretation requires large statistical samples that are not yet available. We propose to take advantage of a new, compelling method to measure the total gas fraction of high-z quiescent galaxies by using the brightest molecular gas mass tracer, i.e. the [CII] 158 microns fine-structure emission line. This line has long been overlooked since it is predominantly used for star-forming galaxies. However, it becomes particularly useful for quiescent galaxies at high-z since these are often selected to have suppressed sSFRs - but not absent - with respect to main sequence galaxies. By exploting ALMA bands 8-9-10 we will observe gas fractions down to 1% (without strictly requiring strong lensing) in 8 spectroscopically confirmed, well-studied, massive quiescent galaxies at 1.22.9.',\n"," 'Deuteration in galaxies: Breaking ground with ALMA. Since the detection of unexpectedly high deuterium fractionation in the Galactic Center almost 20 years ago, many follow up observations were carried out in different Galactic environments which showed deuterium abundances well above the elemental ratio D/H~1.5x10^-5. These observations have been well reproduced by chemical models and showed that deuteration may be an excellent tracer of the degree of chemical processing of the gas by star formation, and therefore a tracer of pristine material feeding the future star formation events. Though models have been proposed for different extragalactic environments, only now, with the superb sensitivity of ALMA, observations are possible. We thus propose to measure for the first time the D/H ratio in the starburst ISM of NGC 253. We aim at simultaneously observe DCN, DCO+ and N2D+, as well as a second observation to target the 13C substitutions of HCN, HCO+ as well as N2H+.',\n"," 'The systematic search for a causal connection between AGN-driven outflows and star formation. Leading models of galaxy formation require kpc-scale AGN-driven outflows to terminate star formation (SF). Observationally there is good evidence for outflows in many AGN but we lack clear evidence for a causal connection between outflows and SF. We recently completed our 25n VLT-KMOS program of distant AGN to undertake a systematic study of AGN-driven outflows and their impact on SF. We have constraints on the key outflow properties (outflow sizes, energetics, rates) but lack the sensitive SF measurements to test the outflow-SF connection. We propose for sensitive ALMA continuum observations of 63 AGN at z=1.1-2.4 (out of a sample of 103 with high-quality outflow constraints) that lack sensitive SF measurements. Our proposed observations will probe SF rates up to an order of magnitude below the mean for X-ray AGN at these redshifts, allowing us to identify even suppressed SF. With the proposed observations we will measure the distributions of SF as a function of outflow property (e.g., emission-line width; spatial extent; outflow energetics; AGN radio power) to systematically search for the \"smoking gun\" evidence for a causal connection between AGN-driven outflows and SF.',\n"," 'Interplay between the Orion A South (OMC-4) filament and dense cores therein. We propose to map the quiescent filament in Orion A South (OMC-4) with 3-mm and 1-mm continuum as well as the dense molecular tracers including N2H+, HNC and HC3N, aiming to reveal the detailed structures and kinematic features of the V-shaped filament of OMC-4, to resolve the dense clumps therein into individual cores of Jeans Scale, and to determine the dynamical properties and the instabilities status of the cores. Eventually, these results would help to understanding several fundamental properties and characters of the filament structures and there roles in mass aggregation and initiating the star formation.',\n"," 'What is the origin of spiral arms in the disk of HD 142527?. In Cycle 0, we discovered CO spiral arms extending out to 500 au in the outer disk of HD 142527. Surprisingly these spirals are very faint in CO (3-2), but brighter in CO (2-1), with temperatures as low as 10 to 15 K. We propose to confirm such low temperatures in HD 142527, and put deep limits on the continuum so as to test for low dust-to-gas mass ratios, that may explain the detection of CO gas colder than the freeze-out temperature (18 K). The new measured dynamics of the gas in the spirals will allow us to put conclusive constraints on their origin. In particular, the new observations of the spirals will also be confronted to our novel hypothesis of spirals launched by the shadows cast by the inclined inner disk.',\n"," '1 kpc Imaging of z~6 Quasar Host Galaxies. Recent ALMA [CII] and dust imaging of a sample of z>6 quasar host galaxies at high spatial resolution (~0.25\", ~2kpc at z~6) reveal a surprising range of morphologies and kinematics. The distribution of gas around these accreting ~10^9 M_sun black holes encodes critical information on the assembly history of these early massive structures that is otherwise inaccessible. Capitalizing on previous low-resolution ALMA observations we request 1 kpc resolution (~0.15\") [CII] and dust continuum imaging of a [CII] flux-limited sample of z>6 quasars. This unparalleled dataset will differentiate between dispersion-dominated compact vs. rotation-dominated extended vs. tidally disturbed [CII] emission, and will pin-down the frequency of merging events in z>6 quasar hosts. They will also provide spatially resolved star formation and gas surface densities and address if the hosts form stars at the Eddington limit. Together with the derived dynamical masses of the hosts (needed to constrain the M_BH/M_dyn ratios) the observations will provide crucial constraints to simulations of the first massive galaxies in the Universe.',\n"," 'WISDOM: Constraining the scatter in the M-sigma relation at fixed velocity dispersion. SMBH masses correlate most tightly with the stellar velocity dispersion of their hosts, but whether the same relation holds for early- and late-type galaxies remains an open question. Various works suggest that massive LTGs follow an M-sigma relation with a similar slope, but lower normalisation than ETGs. This lower SMBH mass at fixed sigma is typically regarded as evidence for the role of SMBH accretion in quenching. However, making strong conclusions is hindered by systematic differences in the techniques used to measure SMBH masses in these different objects. Molecular gas SMBH measurements are the ideal tool to remove this uncertainty. We here propose to begin to answer this question in a targeted manner, using ACA observations for a sample of galaxies in a narrow velocity dispersion range to map the molecular gas in these systems and ascertain whether these are suitable for high-resolution follow up. Given the small uncertainties, with a sample of molecular SMBH masses measurements for 10 ETG and 10 LTG in this range we can robustly measure the offsets relative to the M-sigma relation, and determine whether early and late type galaxies truly follow the same scaling relations.',\n"," 'A direct test of the magnetar-model in Superluminous Supernovae. Stripped-envelope Superluminous Supernovae (SLSN-I) are stellar explosions with optical luminosities ~10-100 times that of supernovae (SNe). An extra energy source is required to account for the extreme luminosity, and recent studies favour the model where this is provided by the spin-down of a rapidly-rotating, strongly-magnetized neutron star (magnetar) formed in the SNe. Importantly, this magnetar-engine model could account for the diverse properties across all classes of stripped-envelope SNe. Additionally, Fast Radio Bursts are attributed to pulsars/magnetars in many leading models and might be created in this way. Given the wide-ranging implications of the model, it is vital that we establish if it is valid. We propose to do the first key test to conclusively determine if SLSNe-I are powered by a magnetar central engine. With 4.76 hours of Band 3 and 6 observations of the closest SLSN-I discovered to date (SN2017egm), we will obtain the deepest sub-mm observations of a SLSN-I and search for the sub-mm magnetar signature. With these observations we will either make the first direct detection of a magnetar central engine or rule out the magnetar-engine model.',\n"," 'Sulphur in protoplanetary disks - a zero-sum game. Sulphur plays an important role in the ionization balance in protoplanetary disks and affects planetesimal differentiation, underlining the need to accurately model the chemical evolution of this element from the protostellar to the planetary stage. The sulphur budget in protoplanetary disks is currently poorly known, observations suggest >90% of volatile sulphur is missing from the gas. Chemical models suggest the main volatile S carriers are CS, SO, SO2, and H2S, but in cold disks their gas-phase abundances may be affected by freezeout. We have recently shown how the photospheric abundances of young A-stars trace the composition of their inner disks. For one such star, HD 100546, the S abundance is consistent with all volatile sulphur accreting as gas through the dust-depleted inner disk cavity. We will use ALMA to obtain a spatially resolved census of the main (and a number of secondary) sulphur-bearing molecules in the disk. Comparison of their summed abundances with the stellar S/H ratio will reveal whether there is a need to invoke new volatile sulphur reservoirs, such as a large abundance of sulphur chains.',\n"," 'Resolving the molecular gas within 100 pc of M87s supermassive black hole. The proximity of M87 (3C 274), the archetypical giant elliptical radio galaxy at the centre of the Virgo galaxy cluster, presents a unique opportunity to investigate in detail the circumnuclear molecular gas revealed first by CO J=1-0 observations with the IRAM 30-m and more recently imaged for the first time with ALMA (this teams Cycle 1 data). The preliminary results from the ALMA data show that the molecular gas is unresolved and resides within 100~pc of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). With this Cycle 3 proposal we wish to obtain 0.12 (~10~pc) imaging of the CO J=1-0 line to unambiguously resolve the molecular gas structures for the first time, allowing us to investigate the nature and origin of molecular gas that resides within the 3.1 sphere of influence (SOI) of the SMBH in unprecedented detail. Such observations are only now possible with ALMAs long baseline capability.',\n"," 'The fall and rise of Betelgeuse: diving in its ejecta with ACA. Some weeks ago the recent dimming of the nearby RSG Betelgeuse caused a cascade of public news, following the suggestion by some that core-collapse may be imminent. Another hypothesis is that the visual dimming is caused by an increased extinction along the line of sight due to an enhanced dust mass-loss episode, consistent with the erratic stellar activity of evolved massive stars. We propose a monitoring programme with ACA in Bands 3 and 6 with a cadence of 15 days, to establish whether the recent visual variability is due to dust and to perform an unprecedented study of the dust properties and formation cycle. We request calibration-limited observations (with photometric uncertainty of 5%) to derive: 1) light curves for each sideband, to analyse and compare their periods and any possible phase lag due to dust life cycle; 2) internal spectral index per band, to study changes of dust opacity. We also request one epoch in Band 7 to evaluate the contribution of molecular line emission on complementary JCMT/SCUBA2 monitoring observations that were recently started. With these observations we will gain an unique insight into dust processes and mass-loss in massive stars.',\n"," 'Mapping M17: the best galactic laboratory for measuring the role of photoionizing feedback. Feedback is a central problem in astrophysics; it affects all stages and all scales of star formation. Recent numerical work has reexamined the role of ionizing feedback, showing that photoevaporation injects momentum into the cold molecular gas. In this way, ionizing feedback may (1) explain compressed layers and high pressures in PDRs; (2) carve dust pillars; and (3) resupply turbulence. High angular resolution observations of the cold gas kinematics are essential to test these predictions. Messier 17 (M17) has the highest degree of ionization of galactic star-forming regions and is unambiguously dominated by pre-supernova feedback, making it the ideal laboratory. We request an ACA mosaic of M17 to measure the cold gas kinematics as a function of position and therefore incident ionizing flux in order to measure the distribution of turbulence in the cold molecular gas. These data also allow us to (a) produce a high resolution map of the PDR, (b) detect dust pillars and protostars and measure their masses, and (c) estimate cloud destruction time. This cloud-scale survey allows us to conduct the first comprehensive study of the role of ionizing feedback in star formation.',\n"," 'Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby Galaxies: The Local Galaxy Inventory Continued. We propose to utilize the ACA (7m+TP) to map in CO(2-1) the full star forming disks of all yet-to-be-observed nearby, large-on-the-sky spiral galaxies in which the ACA resolves molecular cloud scales (50-100 pc). These data will provide the large scale picture of the molecular ISM in five nearby galaxies and enable key insight into the interplay between galactic environment and cloud-scale gas properties. These galaxies harbor a range of physical environments, from massive AGN to low mass flocculent spirals, and thus provide a crucial link between the Local Group (where high resolution permits study of sub-cloud scale physics) and the broader galaxy population (which includes a wider range of environments). With these data we will measure GMC properties and scaling relations, cloud lifetimes, and star formation efficiency as a function of the diverse environments found in these galaxies. The resolution, sensitivity, and spatial coverage match those of our ongoing Large Program to map the disks of more distant targets with the 12m array, and so these additional galaxies will both fold into and inform the larger sample while providing context for ongoing and future zoom-in studies.',\n"," 'Resolving the molecular gas and dust in a unique star forming disk galaxy z~2. We propose to obtain simultaneous high-resolution imaging of the CO 4-3 and [CI] 1-0 emission lines and dust continuum in the best characterized star-forming disk galaxy at z~2. These observations will provide a unique test on the predicted modes of gas accretion by resolving the kinematics and distribution of the molecular gas into kpc-scale regions of active star formation. This will enable an unprecendented view to the obscured star-forming regions that are hidden to the available optical/UV imaging and spectroscopy. We will be able to (1) perform accurate modeling of the galaxy kinematics (kinemetry); (2) characterize the molecular gas and star forming clumps; (3) test star formation laws (gas vs SFR surface densities) in kpc scales, and (4) use their line ratios as a proxy to the fraction of dense gas mass (versus total) to probe the gas excitation in kpc scales. In combination with the previous measurements of CO 3-2/1-0, the proposed observations will allow us to put into context the derived physical properties of the ISM (Tkin, n_H2) for a comprehensive study about the properties of this galaxy.',\n"," 'Mapping the Unique Dwarf Galaxies in the Local Group (MUDGILG). We propose to observe and fully map the CO(2-1) line in two of the most metal-poor, star-forming dwarf galaxies in the Local Group -- IC 1613 and NGC 6822. These would be the first wide-field, high-resolution CO maps of these two galaxies. With only a handful of actively star-forming dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, IC 1613 and NGC 6822 are essential targets to understand the impact of metallicity on the interstellar medium (ISM). Despite its proximity, NGC 6822 has been observed relatively little with ALMA, while IC 1613 has not been observed at all with ALMA. The high sensitivity and large field of view of the ACA will allow us to create the first ever wide-field CO maps of these galaxies, with spatial and kinematic resolution capable of identifying the structure in individual molecular clouds. The proposed observations would enable a rigorous investigation of the properties of the low-metallicity, CO-bright molecular gas in these unique galaxies and would be compared with other tracers of the ISM and star formation, particularly VLA observations of HI, H-alpha imaging to trace recent star formation, and stellar populations characterized by Hubble.',\n"," 'What is the role of molecular gas when galaxies transition from blue to red?. The processes that cause the transition of galaxies from actively starforming to quiescent objects are still poorly understood. Galaxies in Hickson Compact Groups (HCG) are ideal objects to study this topic in a dense environment. Infrared (IR) colours are very powerful to find transitioning galaxies from underpopulated regions (canyon or IR Transition Zone) in the IR color space that indicate a fast transition from star-forming to quiescent. For a sample of transitioning HCG galaxies with CO(1-0) data we found clear evidence for a drastic decrease in the the star formation efficiency (SFE) and in the molecular gas fraction from active to transitioning galaxies (Lisenfeld+2017). However, it is still unclear what causes the decrease and perturbation of the molecular gas. Interactions with neighboring galaxies, intragroup gas and shocks causing turbulence are the suspected reasons. Here, we propose to map a small sample of southern canyon/IRTZ galaxies with the lowest SFE in CO(2-1) in order to derive a detailed image of the molecular gas distribution and kinematics that will allow us to find out whether tidal processes or interaction with intragroup gas is the dominant cause.',\n"," 'Confirming a close quasar pair or a gravitationally lensed quasar at z=5.66. We propose ALMA imaging of the sub-mm continuum and the [C II] line of J2037-4537, a newly discovered apparent quasar pair at z=5.66. J2037-4537 consists of two close quasar images at exactly the same redshift, which are either a physical quasar pair or lensed images of the same quasar. In the former case, J2037-4537 will be the highest redshift quasar pair, which will place strong constraints on AGN evolution models, and will enable follow-up studies including the triggering mechanism of AGN, the small-scale structures of IGM, and the search for a protocluster. In the latter case, J2037-4537 will be only the second lensed quasar known at z>5 and will be an excellent case study for the high-z SMBH population. It is difficult to distinguish the two scenarios in optical/near-IR wavelengths. We propose ALMA imaging for this system which will be the definitive test of the two scenarios. Pair and lensing hypotheses predict distinctively different continuum and [CII] morphology as well as [CII] kinematics of the two components. The proposed observation will also further probe physical properties (SFR, gas kinematics, etc.) of this unique pair/lens system.',\n"," 'A detailed view of the Birds anatomy: the vital organs of a rare triple galaxy merger. The Bird is a luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), logL_IR(L_sun)=11.89, product of a triple merger. The ongoing star formation (SF) in the least massive of the components (the head) outshines that of the primary nuclei (the heart and the body) as evidenced by our Spitzer-24um imaging, hence dominating the LIRG phenomenon in the Bird. This clashes with the commonly accepted major merger scenario in which the SF is expected to be higher in central compact regions. The Bird has a global high SF rate of ~190Msun/yr and shows spectroscopic evidence for outflowing gas reaching v~600 km/s. The complexity of this system makes it a perfect laboratory to study star-forming regions with a wide range of physical conditions, which we can probe with the aid of sub-mm observations. For doing this, we propose to perform a detailed study of the gas (12CO 1-0, 3-2 and 6-5, 13CO 3-2) and dust continuum of the three NIR-bright components of the Bird. The proposed ALMA observations, together with our NIR, MIR and optical data, represent a unique dataset that will allow us to test the major merger scenario, whilst making the Bird a local template to be compared to IR luminous high-z galaxy mergers.',\n"," 'The Serpens-Aquilla Disk and Multiplicity Survey. We propose a survey of 170 protostars in the Serpens-Aquila star-forming region at 0.09\" (~40 au) resolution in Band 7. We will characterize the multiplicity frequency, companion separation distribution, protostellar dust disk masses, and dust disk radii for the largest sample of protostars (besides Orion) within 500 pc. The origin of disks and multiplicity are rooted in the earliest stages of star-formation, but only three sizeable regions have had their protostellar multiplicity and disks characterized (Perseus, Orion, and Ophiuchus). The previous surveys discovered a bimodal distribution of companion separations and it is important to determine if this is `universal. Similarly, disks emerge early, yet it is unclear if the protostellar disk mass and size distributions are similar across all star-forming regions. This is important given that protostellar disks (as an ensemble) are found to be 5-10x more massive than Class II disks. This survey is essential to test whether or not protostellar disks and multiplicity have similar properties across distinct star-forming regions, implying similar physical processes.',\n"," 'An ALMA/JCMT Study of the Time-Variable Class 0 Protostar HOPS 358 and Its (Warped?) Protostellar Disk. The JCMT Transient Survey recently discovered that the Class 0 protostar, HOPS 358, decreased in 350 GHz continuum brightness by 35% over a period of 40 months, with the change likely due to time-variable mass accretion. Based on the Herschel SED, HOPS 358 is thought to be among the youngest protostars in NGC 2068 and therefore an excellent candidate for studying the earliest stages of mass assembly. Fortuitously, the VANDAM: Orion Survey observed HOPS 358 at 0.1\" angular resolution with ALMA at 345 GHz before it began to fade, revealing a bright, resolved edge-on disk. For young protostars, the effective disk viscosity determines the mass accretion rate. Thus, measurement of the variations in the accretion rate and the corresponding appearance of the disk, including a potential disk warp seen in the VANDAM observations, will provide vital clues to how protostellar mass is assembled. HOPS 358 presents the first opportunity to directly study a Class 0 disk at various levels of protostellar activity and constrain the physical processes related to accretion. We thus propose to re-observe HOPS 358 with ALMA Band 7, while its brightness remains low.',\n"," 'The GLEAMing of the first supermassive balck holes in the Universe. The low-frequency radio survey, GLEAM, has opened a new window for identifying radio-loud AGN (RLAGN) during the epoch of reionisation (z > 6). To identify them, we rely on a well-proven technique allowing us to push our current sources to z 5. We select candidates from their radio steep-spectrum radio emission, a well proven technique to identify high-z RLAGN. We focus particularly our research on the GAMA-09 field, allowing to further optimise our selection, observation time and discard potential low-z sources contamination thanks to the multiwavelength information provided by the GAMA survey. We propose here to bypass the traditional framework (consisting of a succession of observations) for identification of high-z sources by using ALMA to scan B3. The discovery of even a single RLAGN at the epoch of reionisation will open up a myriad of powerful new research avenues such as probing the neutral IGM with HI absorption against the radio source but also constrain how supermassive blackholes formed at such high redshifts.',\n"," 'AGN Feedback in Action: Zooming in on the Molecular Outflow in the Nearest Active Galactic Nucleus. Galactic winds are essential to feedback processes that quench star formation and limit the total mass of large galaxies. However, they are poorly understood due to a lack of observational evidence, particularly in the molecular phase. In ALMA Cycle 2, we succsessfully detected the AGN-driven molecular wind in Circinus, constraining the molecular mass of the outflow, velocity, and general morphology. However, these observations are limited in resolution, rendering follow-up observations necessary. With 2.5 additional hours (including overheads) in Cycle 3, we will obtain a factor of 7 improvement in beam area to resolve structure on 25 pc scales - crucial to demonstrating interactions with the ISM. We will create detailed kinematic models of the wind, essential to determining whether molecular gas leaves the galaxy and if/when/where it is reaccreted to fuel future star formation.',\n"," 'High spatial resolution imaging of the inner envelope of R Sculptoris. We propose to observe the detailed structure of the spiral shape detected in Cycle 0 observations in CO line emission around the carbon AGB star R Scl. A succesfull Cycle 1 proposal (carried over to Cycle 2) was aimed at observing the circumstellar emission from R Scl at high angular resolution in CO emission in band 7. The proposal combines the most extended main-array configuration for high spatial resolution with a compact main array configuration, ACA and total power observations. The data will describe the detailed inner circumstellar morphology by measuring deviations from a perfect spiral, resolving the binary system, and accurately measuring the contrast between the winding and inter-winding regions, relying on the high angular-resolution observations. The Cycle 1 low-resolution data confirm the Cycle 0 findings. However, the extended configuration has not yet been observed. Missing the high-resolution data will limit the value of the delivered Cycle 1 observations. We therefore resubmit the observations for the extended configuration (a total observing time of approx. 1 hour). In case the data is still completed in Cycle 2, we will withdraw the Cycle 3 proposal.',\n"," 'Characterize the submm nature of host galaxies of a \"quasar-quasar\" pair at the cosmic dawn.

With this only ~2hr investment, we can characterize star-formation rates, global gas distribution, dynamical masses, early co-evolution, and even ~10 kpc-scale reionization geometry around the system. From our optical data, we already captured hints of close interaction of these quasars. According to hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy-mergers, such interacting galaxies will coalesce to form a heavily dust-obscured starburst and an extremely luminous quasar such as discovered by past wide-field optical surveys. Hence, this quasar-quasar pair will provide a very unique laboratory to study the formation processes (or conditions) of luminous quasars (supermassive black holes), massive galaxies, and early co-evolution, at the cosmic dawn. The properties obtained here must be beneficial for planning efficient JWST Cycle 1 and ALMA Cycle 8 programs to investigate further details of this system.

The interactions between gas and galaxies are of paramount importance to our understanding of structure formation. A fundamental element of such baryon cycle studies is a complete census of the condensed matter (stars and cold gas) in both galaxies and their immediate surroundings, the so-called circumgalactic medium. Probes of the neutral atomic gas HI, ionised gas and stellar component have been assembled for of a sample of 48 galaxies. Without a quantitative description of the molecular phase however, one cannot reach a full census of their baryons. ALMAs unrivaled mm coverage and high sensitivity is ideal to characterise the CO emission of these z~0.5 HI-selected galaxies. By measuring the molecular mass, kinematics, gas flows and gas fractions, the project will: i) determine the role of molecular gas in HI-rich galaxies, ii) decipher the molecular phase of gas flows from morpho-kinematics analyses, and iii) reach a complete census of the condensed baryons in the circumgalactic medium. These results will provide unique insights into the baryon cycle - a crucial component of galaxy formation.',\n"," 'Characterizing diffusive processes in the B335 protostar. The ionization fraction in protostellar environments is a key ingredient responsible for the efficiency of most diffusive processes allowing to diffuse the magnetic field in protostellar enevlopes, therefore modifying strongly the efficiency of magnetic braking during the main accretion phase. Recent observational and theoretical results highlight the role of magnetic braking in other long-standing problems in astronomy such as the angular momentum problem, and the formation of stellar binaries and disks. Here, we propose to simultaneously and independently characterize the magnetic topology, magnetic intensity, and diffusive processes in a young protostar, B335, using observations of molecular ions to be combined with our already obtained polarization data. We will characterize finely the coupling of the field to the circumstellar gas, and describe the efficiency of magnetic braking to drive angular momentum transport, regulate the accretion rate, and affect disk formation in this young accreting protostar.',\n"," 'Starburst-driven superwind in the nearby galaxy NGC 1808 traced by CI. Multi-line imaging of galactic superwinds is essential to determine the energetics of outflowing gas and understand how the winds regulate star formation in their host galaxies. In this study, we propose observations of atomic carbon CI (J=1-0 at 492 GHz) complemented with molecular gas tracers (mainly CO) in the central region of NGC 1808, a nearby starburst galaxy with a superwind. We aim to: 1) Measure the distribution of atomic carbon gas with respect to the molecular gas and tracers of star formation. A comparison of atomic and molecular lines at high resolution (25-50 pc) would allow us to determine the physical conditions (kinetic temperature and density) of molecular gas and reveal the structure of the photodissociation region (PDR) in the starburst environment. 2) Measure the CI flux in a resolved superwind to analyze whether CI traces the same bulk molecular gas as CO, and search for CO-dark gas in the outflow. The derived physical conditions will be used to construct a PDR model for the outflow gas. Such model can become a reference for interpreting CI and CO data at high redshift, where superwinds are considered to be a major feedback mechanism in galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'Final Piece of the Puzzle: What Drives the Enhanced X-ray Emission from the Most Powerful Jets in the Early Universe. We propose ALMA observations of 15 highly radio-loud quasars at z>4 to obtain their far-infrared luminosity and investigate its correlation with their X-ray luminosity. A positive correlation between these two quantities may indicate a dominating jet-linked X-ray emission mechanism of inverse Compton scattering of the host-galaxy photon field produced by a starburst. With this mechanism, the enhanced star-forming activity at high redshifts can also explain the X-ray emission enhancement of these objects over their counterparts at lower redshifts. The lack of such far-infrared/X-ray correlation would support an alternative mechanism of the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons.',\n"," 'Searching for CO-dark H2 gas in radio jets. Our recent discovery shows that cosmic-rays (CRs) and X-rays destroy CO by converting it to CI while the H2-gas remains unaffected. This challenges the widely used CO-to-H2 conversion method in extreme environments, especially in outflows associated with radio emission. These outflows are strongly magnetised, with high densities of CRs and X-rays. Recent ALMA detections of CO in outflows associated with radio jets indicate that H2 can exist in such extreme environments. Therefore, we propose CI 1-0 observations in the radio jets of Minkowskis Object and M87, where CO lines have been detected. We aim at i) Detecting hidden H2 reservoir in radio jets, ii) determining the degree of CI-CO concomitance, iii) Disentangle shock- and CR-/X-ray chemistry, iv) estimating H2 outflow mass, and v) estimating star formation efficiency along the outflow by comparing with CO-based measurements. This will be a key experiment for testing our theoretical predictions that CI emission in both radio jets would be much brighter than scaled from CO lines under normal conditions of molecular clouds. If confirmed, it will open a new window for detecting H2-gas under extreme conditions.',\n"," 'Opacity Variability in Neptunes Troposphere. We request time (~2h) to view Neptune in the millimeter.

We propose a pilot project to observe the CO(5-4) line plus the dust continuum close to the IR peak in four normal, main sequence, star-forming galaxies at z~4.5. From this we will measure for the first time directly the molecular gas content, the corresponding gas fraction, and the molecular gas depletion timescale in such high redshift galaxies. The observations will also allow us to compare the direct measure of the molecular gas mass from CO to that estimated from the dust mass, assuming a constant dust-to-gas ratio. Our sources are selected from a large spectroscopic survey in a field with abundant ancillary data. Combined with recent and ongoing observations targeting z~2.7-3.5 galaxies, our ALMA measurements will allow us to study the redshift evolution of the molecular gas fraction and depletion timescales beyond z~2 and out to z~4.5. This will provide important tests and constraints on our understanding of gas accretion and star formation in the high redshift Universe.',\n"," 'Spectral line survey toward a hot molecular core in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Because cosmic metallicity is increasing in time with the evolution of our universe, interstellar chemistry in low metallicity environments is crucial to understand chemical processes in the past metal-poor universe. Based on our ALMA Cycle 1 program, we have identified a hot molecular core in a nearby low metallicity galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. The ALMA data suggests that the molecular abundances of the LMC hot core are significantly different from those of Galactic hot cores. The LMC hot core provide us great opportunities to investigate chemical compositions of complex organic molecules in low metallicity environments. However, since only limited spectral regions were observed during Cycle 1, the detailed chemical compositions of the LMC hot core still remain to be investigated. Here we propose an unbiased spectral line survey toward the LMC hot core in the 333-364 GHz region. A goal of this program is to unveil chemical compositions of a hot molecular core in the LMC, particularly focusing on chemistry of complex organic molecules, and to understand them in relation to the characteristic low metallicity environment.',\n"," 'Does the fine structure constant change with time ?. We propose to use the ALMA Band-6 receivers to obtain deep spectra in the redshifted CI 492 GHz and CO(4-3) 461 GHz transitions from the z=0.88582 lens towards PKS1830-210. A comparison between the redshifts of the fine-structure CI and rotational CO transitions provides a sensitive probe of changes in the fine structure constant and the proton-electron mass ratio. Using existing stringent constraints on changes in the proton-electron mass ratio from the same absorber, the proposed observations will yield the highest sensitivity to changes in the fine structure constant from any astrophysical method and will definitively confirm or deny the variations in the fine structure constant detected with the many-multiplet method. We request 38 minutes of time for this project, including all calibration and overheads.',\n"," 'Breaking Cosmic Dawn: Studying z~7 Galaxies with ALMA. Was reionization gradual or did it occur instantaneously? When did it occur and which sources were responsible? To answer these questions we need to unambiguously detect galaxies at z~7 and study their star formation properties. This proposal will achieve this by measuring [CII]line in a sample of z~7, highly magnified due to gravitational lensing, yet intrinsically ordinary galaxies selected from our large Spitzer and HST campaigns. All galaxies have spectroscopic detections from HST grism and/or Keck data and measured evolved stellar population from Spitzer data. We will also compare [CII] and UV/optical emission to the predictions from simulations, and investigate whether the relation between star formation rate and L[CII] differs from the local universe due to modified Kennicutt-Schmidt relation at z~7 or low metallicity. The proposed observations have sufficient resolution and depth due to gravitational lensing to test both scenaria. This proposal will thus firmly establish ALMA as a major facility for studies of galaxy formation at the reionization era.',\n"," 'Black hole mass measurements in the most MASSIVE Galaxies. Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs), as the end point of galaxy evolution, are the subject of intense interest. Yet, their complex formation histories remain obscure. In lower-mass objects black holes (BHs) are strongly correlated with properties of the stellar bulge implying co-evolution between the BH and stellar components. The BH mass in massive ETGs, however, does not correlate well with galaxy parameters. The most massive ETGs and their central BHs therefore may have followed different evolutionary paths from their less-massive counterparts. We propose here to complete our cycle-4, 5 and 6 observations of the molecular discs that lie in the heart of two of the most massive molecular gas hosting ETGs in the local universe, in order to estimate their SMBH masses. With these observations we can test the feedback paradigm, constrain the environmental dependance of SMBH-host galaxy relations, provide important cross-checks on SMBH mass measurement techniques and anchor studies of the SMBH-host galaxy relations which use molecular gas. In this way a short investment of ALMA time can help reveal more about the complex formation histories of the most massive galaxies in our universe.',\n"," 'Dense Gas Thermometry of Starburst Galaxies. A characterization of the physical properties of the dense gas within the interstellar medium of starburst galaxies is critical to our understanding of their evolution. Many of the molecular tracers used to characterize the dense gas in star-forming galaxies suffer from a coupled degenerate sensitivity to the kinetic temperature and volume density. A molecular tracer which can decouple individual physical conditions is required. Results from a survey of a sample of active star-forming galaxies has shown that Formaldehyde (H2CO) is a reliable and accurate density probe for extragalactic environments where the kinetic temperature is known. Ammonia (NH3) is a traditional probe of the kinetic temperature in dense gas environments, but its utility requires an assumption of cospatiality between dense gas tracers is required. Using the unique sensitivities to kinetic temperature afforded by the excitation characteristics of several transitions of H2CO, we propose to continue our characterization of the dense gas in galaxies exhibiting starbursts by imaging the gas kinetic temperature in a representative pilot sample of three starburst galaxies: Arp220, NGC253, and NGC4945.',\n"," 'The Explosive Orion OMC1 Outflow. The explosive Orion OMC1 outflow in the nearest site of active massive star formation (D~414 pc) may have been triggered by the dynamic ejection of massive stars ~500 years ago. The proposed 1\" resolution ALMA J=CO 2-1 mosaic will measure the mass and momentum of gas in near-IR shock-excited fingers protruding form the explosion site. 1.3 mm continuum and molecules will be used to search for dense high-velocity (>100 km/s) clumps expected at the [FeII]-bright fingertips, to measure the masses of dozens of proto-planetary disks in the foreground Orion Nebula and embedded protostars in OMC1, and to trace the 1.2 mm dust and free-free continuum in the field. The goals are: * Search for dust and measure radial velocities and masses of clumps in the fingertips. * Measure the mass, momentum, and structure of the gas along the H2 wakes. * Determine the masses of the circumstellar disks surrounding in dozens of YSOs. * Probe the relation between the ~500 year old OMC1 outflow and the 10\" long, 200 year old flow from source I.',\n"," 'The protosolar nebula heritage: measuring the nitrogen isotopic ratio in disks. In which forms were the chemical elements incorporated in the Solar System ? This broad topic is at the crossroads of several fields of investigation: cosmochemistry, astrobiology, and astrophysics. Because models are not able to follow the abundances of chemical species along the molecular cloud to star and planet forming sequence, this question can only be tackled observationally using ratios of stable isotopes. ALMA has the potential to revolutionize the question of our origins, by allowing us to trace our chemical history back into our parental and dispersed molecular cloud. This proposal focusses on nitrogen, a key element for terrestrial life, for which interstellar chemistry provides a consistent view of the isotopic ratios measured in embryos of star forming regions and in the protosolar nebula. Yet, one crucial measurement in the foregoing sequence is lacking, which may be key to the emerging picture of the chemical heritage of the protosolar nebula: namely, the nitrogen isotopic ratios in circumstellar disks. We propose to perform the first measurement of the 14N/15N ratio in the TW Hya disk, using CN as a carrier which is the best tracer of the bulk isotopic ratio.',\n"," 'Mapping the Inner Edge of a Kepler-Analog Circumbinary Protoplanetary Disk. Kepler discovered several circumbinary planets around short-period (P < 40 days) binary stars, indicating that circumbinary planets form readily. A key input to any circumbinary planet formation theory is the radius at which the dynamical tides from the (possibly eccentric) binary orbit truncate the inner edge of the protplanetary disk. Through moderate resolution observations in Cycle 4, we have discovered that a circumbinary disk, whose orbital properties broadly match the sample of Kepler circumbinary planets, hosts a large dust hole ~25 au in radius. The inner edge of the hole is azimuthally asymmetric, and is quite a bit further out in the disk than one would predict from classical truncation arguments alone. It is an open question as to whether the gap is indeed the result of influence from the binary, is carved by one or more giant planets, or is a consequence of the advanced age of the system (16 Myr). We propose for high resolution (0.02\"), sensitive dust continuum observations to map the asymmetry of the disk edge and determine whether the cavity is truly devoid of dust emission or contains the dynamical signatures of giant planets.',\n"," 'Towards an evolutonary sequence in young planetary mass companions. In recent years a small number of planetary mass companion candidates (PMCs) at large orbital distances from their host stars have been identified. Their formation mechanism remains unknown, but studying the PMCs that are still in formation is providing some vital clues. We have selected 5 young PMC candidates aiming for a detection of their circumplanetary disks through ALMA 1.3 mm observations. The proposed observations will be deep enough to provide strong constraints on the potential circumplanetary disk structure, the reservoir of proto-lunar material and its relation with the circumstellar emission. Our targets span a wide range of young ages, so the proposed observations could represent the starting point for establishing an evolutionary sequence for PMC formation.',\n"," 'The Magnetic Heart of NGC253s Starburst-Driven Wind. We propose Band 4 and 7 polarization observations of the central starburst region in the nearby galaxy NGC253. The proposed observations will trace the magnetic field structure at spatial scales between 5 and 200pc, yielding the first parsec-scale map of the magnetic field structure in the dense gas at the heart of a starburst system. The data will provide 10 times better linear resolution than the best existing radio polarisation map for NGC253, and increase the number of measurements of the dust polarisation in NGC253 by more than two orders of magnitude. This will permit a detailed study of the magnetic field geometry relative to wind-driven ISM structures at other wavebands. We will use the data to test MHD models for the survival of cold gas entrained in galactic winds, an important outstanding puzzle for galactic wind physics.',\n"," 'The Morphology of the Magnetic Field of HL Tau. The formation of disks around protostars is thought to be regulated through magnetic fields, and theoretical models suggest that the fractional polarization should be approximately 2-3%. Nevertheless, resolved observations of disks in T Tauri stars (TTS) have remained undetected and are constrained to have fractional polarization of less than 1%. However, with CARMA observations of HL Tau, we recently found the first detection of a resolved magnetic field about a TTS. Unfortunately, such observations have insufficient resolution to discern the true magnetic field morphology. Therefore, HL Tau is the quintessential source for follow-up ALMA observations. High resolution ALMA observations will allow us to discern the morphology of TTS magnetic fields, which will supply theory with the first observational constraint of the magnetic field morphology during the Class II stage of star formation.',\n"," 'Linking the Chemistry to the Morphology of the Ejecta of Supergiant VY Canis Majoris. High mass loss events are observed in evolved massive stars across the upper HR Diagram. The famous red supergiant VY CMa is the perfect star to explore these events. Previous optical spectroscopy and imaging of VY CMa revealed the 3-D morphology of its complex circumstellar ejecta and recent mass loss history. We propose to explore VY CMas chemical enrichment history and association of molecular gas with these specific mass loss events. We will focus on the oldest, larger-scale structures (Arc1, Arc 2, NW Arc), but also examine clumps closer to the star (e.g. Clump C), combined with previous ALMA data and single-dish spectra from the ARO 1 mm survey. We will observe molecules that trace varying densities (CO, CS, HCN), evaluate 12C/13C ratios (13CO and H13CN), and further explore carbon and sulfur chemistry. These data will establish the physical and chemical properties of individual arcs and clumps across the entire envelope, providing insight into mass loss mechanisms. We also will examine aluminum and phosphorus chemistry, imaging PO, PN, AlO, and AlOH, in order to understand their spatial relationships and the influence of dust condensation and shocks on their formation.',\n"," 'Very Low Luminosity Objects in Molecular Clouds. Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs) are young stellar sources that are defined by luminosities less than 0.1 solar luminosity and rising mid-infrared spectral energy distributions. But what exactly are they: brown dwarfs or low-mass stars in formation, systems exhibiting low accretion, extremely young objects? We propose to characterize the VeLLO class through observations of 1.3mm continuum and CO J=2-1 outflow emission of a sample of 21 likely candidates in the nearby Ophiuchus and Lupus molecular clouds. Combined with our successful Cycle-2 program, this survey is expected to triple the number of confirmed VeLLOs as well as extend the class to sources with even lower luminosities. Our observations will provide estimates of their inner envelope masses, and help address questions concerning the nature of VeLLOs.',\n"," 'ALMA Exploration of Cosmic Reionization with a Newly-Discovered Luminous Star-Forming Galaxy at z=7.31. We propose deep Band 6 observations of a very distant spectroscopically-confirmed star-forming galaxy newly-discovered by the powerful combination of Subaru imaging and Keck spectroscopy. This source, at a redshift of z=7.308, lies within the heart of the reionization era yet is bright enough for a robust detection of the diagnostic [CII] 158 micron line given ALMAs improved Cycle 1 performance. As [CII] arises from photo-dissociation regions (PDRs), its observed wavelength will provide an otherwise unattainable measure of the systemic velocity of this distant galaxy. In combination with our Lyman alpha profile and the statistics of line emission in our Subaru sample, we can secure a valuable measure of the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium at this early epoch. To date there are no such measures at such a high redshift. The fluxes of the 1.2mm dust continuum and [CII] line will also provide valuable data on the dust content and star formation rate of this early system. These properties are key not only for understanding reionization history, but also for characterizing the nature of star formation in early galaxies by providing new constraints on the cloud density and the far-UV radiation field of PDRs. By targeting the most distant robustly-confirmed galaxy accessible with the Cycle 1 capability, our observations will showcase the dramatic possibilities with ALMA and provide the first valuable step towards future studies of galaxies within the reionization era, including those exploiting samples that we expect to be discovered with upcoming deep imaging campaigns with HST and Spitzer.',\n"," 'The remarkable 268 GHz line of water: a new tracer of the inner wind of evolved stars?. We have detected a highly excited water emission line at 268.149 GHz in the v2=2 vibrational state from multiple oxygen-rich evolved stars in the sample of the ATOMIUM Large Program in Cycle 6. The upper energy level of this line is above 6000 K, well above most of the other commonly detected (sub)millimeter H2O transitions. Preliminary images from long-baseline observations of June/July 2019 indicate that the 268 GHz line arises from the inner wind close to the star. Since this line appears to be widespread among the observed targets, it has the potential to probe the physical conditions and kinematics of the densest gas within the dust formation zone of O-rich stars that is not accessible to other tracers at lower energy levels. High-spatial resolution images suggest this line exhibits maser action, but this is difficult to confirm with the low velocity resolution of 1.3 km/s of the main-array data. Hence, we propose to follow up on the discovery of this widespread H2O line with the ACA at a much better velocity resolution (0.14 km/s) to spectrally resolve its line profiles in the strongest sources.',\n"," 'Physical Conditions of the Young HL Tau disk. Growing numbers of observations suggest that the first steps of planet formation may be well underway when the disk is still surrounded by an infalling envelope. The fundamental physical conditions inside young embedded disks are still highly uncertain, especially on the gas mass distribution and thermal structure. The HL Tau disk is one of the youngest disk candidates for planet formation. We have carried out pathfinder observations of C18O/C17O/13C18O (2-1) lines (2\" resolution) towards the HL Tau disk and determined that 13C18O is the only optically thin tracer of the disk. Here we propose ALMA to spatially resolve the 13C18O/C17O (3-2) lines of the HL Tau disk at 0.3\" resolution to trace its gas mass distribution and the radial temperature structure. These observations will provide crucial data that can constrain physical conditions inside the best-studied early disk and demonstrate whether physical conditions in early disks are significantly different from those in Class II systems.',\n"," 'Observations of CO2 snowline tracer HCO2+ towards young bursting stars. Observationally locating the position of the CO2 snowline is crucial because it will constrain the physical and chemical conditions of disks and give information on modern theories of dust-grain growth and planet formation. However, because of the lack of a permanent dipole moment, CO2 itself cannot be observed with ALMA. Protonated carbon dioxide, HCO2+, could instead be a good tracer of the CO2 snowline position. The spatial distribution of HCO2+ is expected to be ring-shaped; the outer and inner edges of the ring corresponds to the positions of the CO2 and H2O snowlines. We here propose to confirm the effectiveness of this method and to investigate gas-phase CO2 abundance distributions by observing rotational transition lines of HCO2+ at Bands 3 and 6. Target sources are selected from young bursting stars, IRAS 15398-3359 and V883 Ori. The accretion burst is thought to be important in terms of thermal history of materials in planetary systems. One of our target HCO2+ lines has been detected towards the former object by previous single-dish survey observations, suggesting large line intensities enough for detection.',\n"," 'ALMA Mapping of a Great Case of Ongoing Ram Pressure Stripping in the Nearby Virgo Cluster. We propose to map CO(2-1), CO(3-2) and 870um continuum in the spiral NGC~4402, one of the best cases of active ram pressure stripping in the nearby Virgo cluster. HST images reveal a remarkable variety of ISM features associated with ongoing stripping that we would like to characterize, including kpc-scale head-tail filaments, small decoupled clouds, ablated extraplanar dust plumes, several-kpc-long extraplanar dust fronts, and leading edge star-forming complexes. We will measure cloud sizes, linewidths, masses (gas and dust), and CO(3-2)/CO(2-1) ratios, and compare cloud properties with various nearby galaxies, to learn whether the clouds which appear to be affected by ram pressure have distinct properties. We can determine the cloud mass function and its spatial variation, to explore whether ISM compression along the leading edge results in more massive clouds, and estimate the fraction of the ISM mass that decouples during stripping. Comparison of simulations with these detailed observations of gas being stripped from the disk will give us a better understanding of the efficiency of stripping, and therefore its impact as a quenching mechanism throughout the universe.',\n"," 'ALMA observations of an extreme stellar dimming. \"Little dipper\" stars are a recently discovered kind of variable main-sequence stars that exhibit small (~ a few %) dimming events, usually attributed to transiting exocomets in these systems. The most famous example of these objects is Boyajians star, which underwent a series of deep and aperiodic transits that decreased its stellar flux by up to 20% in some cases. Mechanisms such as a large family of exocomets and planetary collisions have been proposed to explain its peculiar behavior. A few days ago, the brightness of the Solar-type star ASASSN-21qj decreased by ~90% with respect to its quiescent value. This is, by far, the most extreme dimming event ever reported, maybe the result of large collisions of planetesimals in the system. We propose to obtain deep Band 7 continuum observations of ASASSN-21qj to search for sub-mm excess that would indicate the presence of mm-sized dust grains released in such collisions. A non-detection would place tight constraints on some of the most extreme scenarios that could explain this dimming event. These would represent the most sensitive (sub)mm observations to date of this mysterious kind of objects.',\n"," 'Triggering and supression of star formation in recent gas-rich minor mergers. Galaxy mergers are a crucial part of our galaxy evolution paradigm. Gas-rich & gas-poor mergers have been well studied. However a third intermediate class exists, where one of the merging objects has gas, and the other does not (gas-rich+gas-poor). Such mergers are quite common at low redshift, but have not been well characterised. A recent study suggests that mergers where a gas-rich minor companion is accreted onto a gas-poor central actually lead to very low efficiency star formation, in stark contrast to the starburst often observed in purely gas-rich mergers. In order to understand this phenomenon we here propose to observe a carefully constructed sample of gas-rich+gas-poor & gas-rich minor mergers with the ACA, revealing the compactness/dynamical state of their molecular reservoir, and how this relates to their star formation efficiencies, & those of a robust control sample selected from the literature. A short investment of ACA time will allow us to reveal how gas gas-rich+gas-poor mergers differ from better studied gas-rich mergers, and lay the ground work for future observational & theoretical efforts to fully resolve the physical processes behind these differences.',\n"," 'Double-ring debris disks at 10s of au: probing how far out planets can form. The census of exoplanets only shows a few with 10s of AUseparations. On the other hand, observations of debris disks have shown that planetesimals can form at large separations, but it is not yet clear how far planets can form. Debris disks provide a unique tool as they can reveal the presence of planets at tens of AU. HD92945 and HD107146 are uniquely placed to pursue this question because they have broad disks with double rings at 10s of AU that suggest the presence of planets at large separation. However, 3 different scenarios can explain this and differ in where the planets formed: 1) a planet formed in situ opens a gap in a broad disk by direct scattering and resonance overlap; 2) a planet that formed closer in and migrated outwards traps planetesimals in resonances; 3) an eccentric planet formed closer in, but was scattered out then opens a gap through secular interactions with the disk. These scenarios predict significant differences in the disks high resolution structure that are detectable by ALMA. We propose to observe these systems at a resolution of 0.6\" to disentangle the origin of the double rings and planet formation history at large separations in these systems.',\n"," 'HD 97048: A Planetary system in the making. HD 97048 is one of the brightest disks at 850 micron in the sky, and a prime target to observe at high angular resolution to look for ring systems such as recently observed in HL Tau and TW HYa. In our cycle 2 band 7 observations we detect radially a disk hole up to 50 au, and disk gaps at ~90 and ~260 au. Supplementary data point at more structure inside the disk gap. By observing this disk at 0.06\" resolution at band 7, we will resolve features ~10 au in size, while supplementary cycle 2 data allows us to trace structures out to ~2.5 arcseconds in radius. 13CO J=3-2 observations will, in concert with existing 12CO J=3-2 data, give a measure of the density and temperature inside and out of the gaps and hole. Both the dust and the gas observations will help diagnose the origin of the concentric gaps.',\n"," 'The dense gas star-formation law in dusty star-forming galaxies at z~2-4. Understanding the physical mechanisms triggering intense star formation in high-z dusty starburst galaxies requires probing the gas in a wide range of environments, including the densest cores of giant molecular clouds. These regions are the main sites of star formation but they remain little studied, especially at high-z, because they are opaque to the brightest, most common gas tracers. Here we propose to characterize the dense gas star-formation law in rapidly star-forming galaxies at z~2-4, by observing two mid-J transitions of HCO+, HCN, and HNC at 0.5-1.0\" resolution in four of the brightest, strongly lensed galaxies in the Southern sub-mm sky. The brightness and exquisite ancillary follow-up make these galaxies ideally suited for measuring intrinsic dense-gas line fluxes from spatially-resolved observations. This will provide us with a unique opportunity (1) to determine whether or not high-z starbursts follow the dense gas star-formation law found in less extreme, low-z environments; (2) to measure the dense gas mass fractions and depletion times; and (3) to constrain the local ratios between dense and more ambient gas phases and compare with low-z galaxies.',\n"," 'The galaxy-wide impact of powerful feedback in ULIRGs. In recent years, the SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) has enabled observations of high-J CO transitions (J = 5 to J = 13) for a large number of local Ultra Luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). These observations have been successfully used, together with low-J CO, mid-IR and far-IR spectral lines, in radiative transfer modeling codes (such as RADEX) to determine the relative contributions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), star formation, and mechanical heating to the energy budget, and to constrain the density, temperature and column density in different phases of the interstellar medium (ISM). While such studies abound for local ULIRGs, they include only 3 sources hosting strong molecular outflows, a key step in quenching star formation in the outflow host galaxy. Here, we propose to observe low-J CO lines from 9 local ULIRGs hosting powerful molecular outflows, which have near-complete observations of the mid/high-J CO lines, as well as mid-IR and FIR spectroscopy, in order to complete their CO SLED from J = 1-0 to J = 13 - 12. This will be the first statistical test for any galaxy-wide changes to the ISM and star formation in ULIRGs as a result of molecular outflows.',\n"," 'Dust structures in the beta Pictoris disk at high resolution. We propose to image the brightest debris disk - beta Pictoris - with ALMA in band 6. The primary aim is to study the distribution of mm-sized dust on scales from ~150AU down to ~7AU, near the planet beta Pic b. This will enable us to delineate the location of the colliding planetesimals - the ultimate cause of the debris cascade in such disks. We will compare this with the distribution of sub-micron grains seen in scattered light, the micron grains seen in the mid-IR and the location of the planet beta Pictoris b The results will be used to test models both of grain physics and of interactions of planets with debris disks. This will be applicable not only to beta Pic itself, but also to debris systems in general. The images will probe the mm-grain population of several intriguing structures, including the 100AU ring, the outer disk, inner clumps, as well as the warp or inclined disk. Simultaneously we will be performing a deep search for emission from the circumstellar CO and SiO in the disk, probing the origin of the gas and the nature of the parent planetesimals.',\n"," 'How do stellar bars alter the properties of the molecular gas disk. Analysis of the first 120pc resolution CO(2-1) maps from our PHANGS-ALMA LP reveals a tight relation between molecular gas surface density and line width, implying that molecular gas is close to energy balance across star-forming galaxy disks. Central regions in barred galaxies deviate markedly from the relation suggesting that bars significantly alter molecular gas properties. We propose 0.25\" (20pc) high-resolution follow-up observations for 6 carefully selected, barred, CO-bright galaxies with large line widths, covering a diverse set of morphologies/bar properties. The sample size ensures robustness against effects of (fast) time evolution. The proposed data will test four physical mechanisms to explain these surprising results: (a) intra-cloud motion (b) stellar feedback from nuclear star formation (c) large-scale shocks induced by the bar (d) coupling of internal cloud kinematics to orbital motions Understanding which physical mechanism(s) cause the centers to behave differently is key to link molecular gas structure and physics to star formation (from PHANGS-HST) in this unique environment, providing a key link to modelling and observations of the CMZ in our own galaxy.',\n"," 'Unviased Chemical Survey of Protostellar Sources in Perseus. It is well known that low-mass protostellar cores show significant chemical diversity. One distinct case is hot corino chemistry characterized by rich saturated complex organic molecules, while the other distinct case is warm carbon chain chemistry (WCCC) characterized by rich carbon-chain molecules. However, the number of sources definitively classified into them are limited, and the statistics is apparently poor. We here propose to conduct an unbiased survey of chemical composition toward 37 Class 0/I protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud complex. Our recent observations toward these target sources with the single-dish telescopes shows clear chemical diversity, where many intermediate sources are found between the two distinct cases. We are going to confirm this result with ALMA to establish chemical diversity in the 200 AU scale. A relative occurrence of each category (hot corino chemistry, WCCC, or intermediate) as well as preferential association of the sources in each category with a specific part of the cloud complex will give us an important clue to understanding the origin of the chemical diversity in terms of evolutionary history and/or environmental effects.',\n"," 'Formation of sulphur allotropes in the Horsehead nebula. The Horsehead nebula is the only ISM source in which S2H has been detected. Therefore, it is the unique testbed to investigate the formation of long sulphur chains (allotropes) in space thus far. It has been proposed that S2H is formed when H2S ice is irradiated by UV photons. High sensitivity mapping with the ACA will allow us to determine the spatial distribution of both molecules, hence providing valuable information on the S2H formation route and its efficiency. The detection of S2H makes this source the most promising object to search for sulphur allotropes. In particular, we will search for S3, the following chemical step to form long sulphur chains. The detection of S3 will be the first one in the ISM and would confirm that long sulphur chains are an important sulphur resevoir in the interstellar medium. The observation of high excitation transitions of other abundant sulphur-bearing species such as 13CS, SO, OCS and SO2 would help to constrain sulphur chemistry in the transition between the photon-dominated region and the molecular cloud. This project is the fundamental stone on which to build our knowledge of the formation of sulphur allotropes in the ISM.',\n"," 'First characterisation of a directly imaged protoplanet and its natal environment with ALMA. With this proposal, we aim to characterise the transition disk around PDS 70, in particular the local environment of PDS 70 b, a protoplanet which we recently discovered with the SPHERE imager. We will observe PDS 70 b and its direct environment at high angular and spectral resolution using ALMA in Band 7 to study the gas kinematics of the CO isotopologues and trace the planets imprints on the velocity field. Further, we will search for circumplanetary dust in the continuum. If detected, this would be the first direct detection of a circumplanetary disk. The proposed observations will allow for the characterisation of this planetary system, observed in both, NIR and sub-mm regime. They will provide excellent and unique laboratory for understanding the formation and evolution of CPDs, the accretion onto the planet and through the TD gap onto the central star itself.',\n"," 'Spectroscopic Follow-up of Two Luminous Galaxy Candidates in the Epoch of Reionization. The exploration of the early universe and luminous sources therein has been significantly advanced through synergistic strategies across multiple facilities. Remarkably, sub-mm follow-up observations by ALMA of high-z source candidates selected from UV-to-near-infrared observations have opened up a new frontier and enabled us to witness the early evolution of galaxies at the early stage of cosmic reionization. We here propose follow-up observations of 2 luminous (MUV~-22) galaxy candidates at z ~8 with ALMA Band 6. These galaxies were selected from one of the approved Cycle1 JWST GO programs. Our goal is to securely determine the redshift of these galaxies via spectral scanning, targeting the [C II] 158m line. The line is detectable with ~30 minutes on-source exposure per source. Detection of [C II] by our observations will confirm these galaxies as one of the most luminous sources in the epoch of reionization and enable future investigation of their ISM properties with the spectroscopic dataset provided by JWST/NIRSpec. Even non-detection will be a valuable outcome, by providing the JWST GO team an opportunity to finalize their observing targets.',\n"," 'Explaining the puzzling SiO emission toward G331.639+00.501: a high-mass starless cluster-forming clump. A remarkable discovery of recent Galactic Plane surveys, was the presence of quiescent, starless clumps exhibiting widespread SiO emission. These clumps appear dark in the infrared, have low dust temperatures (<20 K) and show no signs of current star formation. Since the SiO emission is usually associated with outflows from newly formed stars, the detection of SiO toward quiescent starless clumps is unusual. We propose to study G331.639+00.501, a quiescent high-mass proto-cluster candidate that exhibits widespread SiO emission. Using ALMA, we will obtain a mosaic of the SiO and dust emission across it to determine whether the SiO emission is due to: (1) outflows from a distributed population of low-mass proto-stars, implying perhaps that low-mass stars have already formed within the clump OR (2) large scale flows due to a recent cloud-cloud collision, which would suggest that we are witnessing clump formation. In either case, these observations will reveal the small-scale distribution of SiO emission toward this cluster-forming clump.',\n"," 'SUPERCOLD-CGM: a high-z survey of molecular gas across the circum-galactic medium of Enormous Lya Nebulae. Massive galaxies at high-z are known to co-evolve with their circum-galactic medium, generally detected in Ly-alpha. However, a direct link between this CGM and the stellar growth of massive galaxies remained missing: we had yet to identify the reservoir of halo gas that can fuel widespread star-formation, namely cold molecular gas (~10-100 K). Following the discovery of a cold CGM in the Spiderweb and two other Lya nebulae, we propose to use ALMA + ACA to perform the first systematic survey of the molecular medium in a sample of 10 QSO-powered Enormous Lya Nebulae (ELANe) at z~2 for which 3D Lya imaging from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager is available. We will simultaneously target the low- and high-density gas tracers CI 3P0-3P1 and CO(4-3) to obtain the mass, extent, composition and physical properties of the multi-phase CGM. In addition, a commensal continuum study will be performed for free in search for the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect from quasar winds that deposit material into the CGM. Studying the multi-phase CGM with sensitive surface-brightness ALMA+ACA observations opens an exciting new window for investigating the early formation of the most massive galaxies in the Universe.',\n"," 'Wide-field imaging of dense gas in the nearby barred galaxxy M83. We propose to make a sensitive mosaic observations of the nearby barred galaxy M83 in HCN (J=1-0). The cycle0 observations of M83 in 12CO (1-0) enabled us to identify ~200 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) over wide range of galactic environments. Comparison with the HII regions indicated that progress of star formation strongly depends on the ratio between two time scales, namely free-fall time and crossing-time. In addition, by adopting a star formation law (SF-law) which relates, SFR, gas mass, and the two time scales, excellent agreement between the observation and the model were obtained for the radial distribution based analyses. Motivated by this finding, we aim to investigate the formation process of dense gas in terms of its environmental dependence, with the deep HCN observation. Since gas clouds denser than 1e4 cm-3 is known to be the basic unit of star formation, to verify the environmental dependence of SF-law, it is more essential to clarify the formation process of such dense gas. By comparing the deep HCN data with the CO data, and with the already available working hypothesis (time scale dependence of SF), we will address the formation process of dense gas.',\n"," 'Powering sources and Lya escaping fractions of Lyman alpha Blobs in the SSA22 field. \"Lyman alpha blobs\" (LABs) are spatially extended Lya nebulae seen at high redshift. The origin of Lya emission is unclear. We have observed 35 LABs in the SSA22 field with JCMT and ALMA, and revealed that 11 out of 18 big LABs are detected at submm wavelengths, but none of the 17 smaller ones. We propose deep ALMA observations towards 24 submm-undetected LABs at band 7. Our science goals are the following. First, it is mandatory to observe the small LABs to find out whether SMGs are common in all LABs and to find out that whether there is a uniform powering source for all LABs or whether the sample is more diverse. Secondly, deep ALMA observations will reveal in some cases that internal powering may not be the only mechanism powering the extended Lyman alpha emission. Thirdly, the escape fractions of Lya photons of the submm-detected LABs are significantly lower than those from the Lyman alpha Emitters in other studies. Thus, it is important to determine the Lya escape fractions of the submm-undetected LABs, the majority of the sample, enabling us to investigate the possible connection between the low Lya escape fractions and the physically extended Lya emission in some LABs.',\n"," 'Formation of VLM stars and BD in Lambda Orionis Star Forming Region (LOSFR). ACA view of LDN1589. For over 10 years, our group has led an ambitious multi-wavelength project to study key aspects of stellar and substellar formation in the LOSFR. For the central cluster, we determined the membership, IMF, and constrained possible substellar formation mechanisms, activity, accretion, disk fractions. One of its dark clouds, B30, has been observed from optical to radio; we studied the earliest stages of substellar objects as well as the radio data. ALMA Band 7 data allowed us to detect 3 very low-mass compact sources. With this proposal we focus on one of the youngest dark clouds of the LOSFR, LND1589, for which we have archival data from the optical to the mid-infrared, and submm data taken by our group at 870um using APEX/LABOCA. We propose ACA Band 6 observations (along with our APEX project) to: i) obtain spectral index information on sources detected in both projects, ii) improve our selection function to identify candidates to be followed up with the 12m array, iii) build a larger poll of pre/proto-substellar objects to put strong constraints on the proposed formation mechanisms.',\n"," 'Probing the Host Galaxy of the Most Massive Black Hole at the End of Reionization. We recently discovered an ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802 at z=6.30, the most luminous known quasar at z>6, powered by a 12 billion M_sun supermassive black hole (SMBH). This discovery strongly challenges theories of SMBH formation. What triggered the extreme BH accretion? Did its host galaxy grow in lockstep with or lag behind the BH? Early PdBI observations show a strong dust continuum and [CII] detection, implying a star formation rate of ~1000 M_sun/yr. We propose to carry out spatially resolved ALMA observations of J0100+2802 to map the dust continuum and [CII] emission of its host galaxy. ALMA observations, combined with HST imaging, will measure the distribution of star formation and dust obscuration in the quasar host galaxy and allow detailed dynamical modeling to estimate the host galaxy mass, probing whether SMBH growth proceeds galaxy assembly. We will search for signatures of galaxy merger and AGN feedback as well as companion [CII] emitters in the highly biased quasar environment. These observations will provide crucial tests to the evolutionary stage of the host galaxy and the triggering mechanism of the most massive SMBHs at the end of cosmic reionization.',\n"," 'Mysterious millimeter excess of radio continuum spectrum in the merging Seyfert galaxy NGC 985 with double nucleus. Aim: We propose to confirm the presence of millimeter excess, which was inferred from the radio continuum up to 43 GHz toward the Seyfert nucleus in the undergoing merger galaxy NGC 985 with double nucleus, by using ALMA at ~100 GHz. Scientific Impact: The possible physical processes are synchrotron radiation from accretion disks corona including nonthermal particles or extremely frustrated radio jets in highly dense environment around the merging nuclei. Any of them is observationally the first case, if we detect it successfully. Why do we need ALMA?: On the basis of our previous VLA observations at 8--43 GHz, the millimeter excess is expected to be ~2 mJy, which was negative detection in our observation using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array at 100 GHz.',\n"," 'High-resolution mapping of molecular gas in starbursts at z ~ 1.5. We propose to determine the molecular gas distribution with ALMA at high resolution of three starbursts (Herschel-detected) galaxies at z ~ 1.5 using the CO 5-4 emission line. A spatial resolution of 0.1-0.25\" enables us to derive kinematic and morphological information on physical scales of 0.8-2 kpc. Our galaxies have total CO fluxes (hence gas masses) from previous ALMA observations that may indicate a higher efficiency of converting gas to stars as responsible for their elevation well-above the star-forming main sequence at z ~ 1.5. This sample is selected from a spectroscopic near-infrared survey of star-forming galaxies in COSMOS with Subaru-FMOS that provides dust-corrected Halpha-based SFRs, metallicities, ionization conditions, and dust extinction using rest-frame optical emission lines. These ALMA observations will further elucidate the nature of sites of extreme star-formation within individual starbursts including their gas density, dust content and star formation efficiency.',\n"," 'Turbulence in a Sample of Protoplanetary Disks. Turbulence is a central component of planet formation theory, yet observational constraints on its magnitude and spatial distribution have so far been scarce. In a pilot study of HD 163296 ALMA Science Verification CO(3-2) emission we found that the high spatial resolution data were able to limit turbulence to less than 3% of the local sound speed. This upper limit is almost an order of magnitude lower than predicted from theory, but it is not clear if this result is unique to this source. Here we propose to extend the sample to include new CO observations of three additional sources. When combined with our constraints in HD 163296, and archival ALMA observations of TW Hya, this sample will cover a wide range of ionizing flux, a crucial parameter for setting the size of the MRI-active region. Additional observations of 13CO and C18O will be used to distinguish between MRI and gravito-turbulence based on the distinct predictions for the vertical turbulent velocity gradient from these two theories of the angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks.',\n"," 'Debris Disk Structure Disentangled. We propose observations of a coherent sample of three edge-on disks that have all been spatially resolved at submm wavelengths and have asymmetric structures observed in scattered light. These disks share two common properties. The first is a well-defined ring of planetesimals, and the second is wings of diffuse dust, which probably come from dynamical interaction either within the disk or between the disk and interstellar medium. Our proposed observations will perform three critical functions: first, unambiguously identify the stable planetesimal belts in three edge-on disks by tracing the location of large (mm-sized) grains out to large radii and determine if these belts are circular or eccentric and therefore perturbed; second, unambiguously determine if non-planetary interaction in the form of interstellar medium ablation is occuring by looking for large grains out of the midplane, and third, measure the grain emission in the same regions as scattered light is observed thereby providing grain albedos.',\n"," 'The V4046 Sgr Disk: A Benchmark for Planetesimal Evolution_(Rev_0.8). We propose a 2-hour \"compact\" configuration observation of the CO 6-5 line and 700 GHz continuum emission from the unique, nearby (73 pc), and \"old\" (8-20 Myr) disk around V4046 Sgr. The proximity and age of this massive, gas-rich disk offer a rare opportunity to observe the subtle effects produced by the growth and migration of its solid contents with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The proposed ALMA observations will be used in tandem with our SMA data (CO 2-1 and 230 GHz continuum) to make two key measurements: (1) use the resolved CO 6-5/2-1 line ratio to determine the gas temperature profile and effective size of the gas disk relative to the dust, a key indirect diagnostic of the radial variation in the gas-to-dust ratio that should be induced by the inward radial drift of solids; and (2) compare the continuum emission morphologies at 700 and 230 GHz to search for evidence of the particle size segregation expected in solid migration models. Although studying these effects is a relatively new topic enabled only now with the start of ALMA science operations, the size and spatial evolution of disk solids is perhaps the most fundamental aspect of the early stages of planet formation. The V4046 Sgr disk is an ideal proving ground for planning future observations of these effects, as well as for highlighting how ALMA data permit rapid, significant progress toward more sophisticated analyses of circumstellar disk evolution and the formation of planetary systems.',\n"," 'Dissecting the ISM of a normal star-forming disk at z=4.5 down to the 500 pc scale. We propose a deep and very high resolution (500 pc) observation of a main-sequence rotator at z=4.5. While the sub-kpc ISM structure in high-redshift starbursts/SMGs has been explored, normal z>4 systems remain an uncharted territory at this resolution. Because of its high surface brightness, its HST and planned JWST observations (COSMOS-Web), VC875 is by far the best candidate to start this type of observations. These observations will resolve the gas clouds, which are the seeds of star formation, and provide high quality dynamical information. We will: 1) reveal the small-scale ISM properties of VC875, detect giant molecular clouds, and measure their dynamical mass; 2) study the resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation; 3) probe the baryon cycle by detecting possible outflows and unveiling the nature of the [CII] halo of VC875; 4) measure from the dynamics the total mass distribution and its connection with the gas and stellar components. In addition, three lower-z (z=1.3,2.0, and 3.4) bright continuum sources are located in the same pointing, allowing for free very high-resolution comparisons of dust versus stellar morphologies, together with the local variations of dust attenuation.',\n"," 'Mapping Envelope Kinematics in Filamentary Environments: Completing the Pilot Program. We propose to complete a pilot Band 6 study of the envelope kinematics of three Orion protostars selected from the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey. These observations are motivated by our recent ALMA maps of three edge-on, relatively isolated protostars in Orion, showing evidence for highly asymmetric infall, in sharp contrast to typical models which assume axisymmetry. We propose to extend our infall study to three protostars found in filamentary environments. These environments are selected to span the range of surface densities/mass to length ratios in the Orion A cloud. We can then study the processes that control low mass star formation by comparing infall between filamentary and (previous mapped) isolated sources and between filaments of different densities. We will use C18O and 13CO to trace envelope motions from the filament to the protostars, augmented by H2CO as a dense gas tracer, N2D+ to trace gas where CO is frozen out, and CO and SiO to trace outflows. Cycle 3 observations were obtained with the ACA and TP, we ask for time to complete the 12 meter observations here.',\n"," 'An ALMA survey to unveil the main mode of star formation in the early Universe. In recent years, convincing evidence have been accumulated that galaxies built up their stellar mass through a steady, diffuse and inefficient gas conversion dominantly taking place in non-interacting disk dominated galaxies. This has been confirmed at least up to z~3, beyond that even the deepest Herschel and JVLA surveys are not able to probe deep enough in L_IR sensitivity to detect normal massive galaxies. Thanks to exceptional ALMA sensitivity we are now in the position to easily detect a statistical sample of normal star forming galaxies at z~4 and test, for the first time, if the secular mode of stellar mass growth extends over all cosmic time.',\n"," 'Characterizing X-ray driven molecular chemistry in the disk population of Orion. The chemistry of protoplanetary disks sets the initial compositions of newly formed planets. Disk abundances typically evolve slowly, over timescales spanning 0.01-1 Myr. Consequently, it was a surprise when ALMA observations taken over a single year significantly varied in H13CO+ emission, an X-ray sensitive molecule. Given the known X-ray variability of disk-hosting stars, one promising theory is variable X-rays are driving variations in the composition of the disk. The present proposal aims to test this hypothesis by observing a group of ten disk-hosting young stars in Orion with both ALMA and Chandra, to definitively catch the smoking gun of X-ray driven chemistry. If confirmed, the proposed program is likely only the beginning of what is essentially a new field of time domain astrochemistry.',\n"," 'A snapshot of planet assembly in a solar nebula analogue. We request ALMA Band 7 observations to map the planet forming region of the disk around the young solar analogue star LkCa15 at a spatial resolution of 5 AU. Near-infrared and millimeter-wave observations of this source have revealed a complex disk morphology which likely resulted from the interation with young giant planets. This hypotesys is supported by the detection of Halpha emission from a putative massive planet orbiting at about 15 AU from the central star. Our project has two goals: (1) To detect the circumplanetry disk surrounding the candidate young accreting planet. (2) To investigate the interaction between the candidate planet and the circumstellar material. The proposed observations aim at obtaining the first robust detection of a forming planet in the microwave regime. This proposal is the resubmission of projects 2016.1.00531.S and 2017.1.00859.S that were awarded time in Cycle 4 and 5, respectively, but were not executed.',\n"," 'Imaging of Circumstellar Matter around Protobinary L 1551 IRS 5: From Infalling Envelope to Circumbinary Disk. We propose Band 7 observations of the low-mass protobinary L1551 IRS 5 with ACA + ALMA 12-m array to seamlessly reveal the detailed structure of circumstellar material: i.e., from the infalling envelope with sizescale 13, or 1800 AU, down to the binary separation of 0.3, or 42 AU. Accurate measurements of the mass infall rate in the envelope and the centrifugal radius, where the transition from infall to pure rotation is taking place, will allow us to directly derive the ``input rate of the angular momentum to the binary system. This is the first step to observationally elucidate the connection between the angular momentum in the envelope and the formation of a binary. We unveil fine structure of transition zone from infall to purely-rotating motion. This will allow us to examine the efficiency of outward transportation of angular momentum in the circumbinary disk. At the same time, we will be able to search for an inner clearing in the circumbinary disk and to determine its size. This is a necessary prelude for observations at even higher angular resolutions to search for accretion streams that penetrate this clearing to feed material onto the circumstellar disks of the individual protostars.',\n"," 'A hybriod scenario for extreme starbursts in high-redshift SMGs. We propose 0.06arcsec (400pc)-resolution observations of CO(4-3) line in the brightest, unlensed SMG at z=4, AzTEC-1. The goal is to reveal the physical mechanisms of extreme starbursts in massive galaxies at high-redshift. In ALMA cycle-3, our high-resolution (150-500pc) 860um dust continnum observations reveal that AzTEC-1 hosts a nuclear starburst with an extremely high far-infrared luminosity surface density and have several clumps on the underlying extended structure. These findings suggest a hybrid scenario, that is a late-stage merging starburst plus an extended, gravitationally unstable disk, to explain the physical properteis of AzTEC-1. In the proposed CO observations, we will study the kinematics in the central region and the outer extended structure to verify the hybrid scenario. The results can be directly compared to central regions in local LIRGs/ULIRGs at same spatial resolution in physical scale. Even for one target, this pioneering work about the new scenario will have a strong impact on galaxy formation models.',\n"," 'Spatially resolved kinematics and SFRs of direct progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z = 2. The discovery of the \"red nugget\" population (massive, compact, quiescent galaxies) at z = 2 indicates that early passive galaxies were remarkably compact compared to their present-day elliptical counterparts. Recent HST observations have identified a likely population of progenitors: similarly massive and compact galaxies that are dusty and star-forming. While several pieces of indirect evidence link these two populations, resolution and sensitivity limitations in optical/NIR observations prevent a direct confirmation. Only the unique capabilities of ALMA in the FIR can provide definitive confirmation of this evolutionary connection. We propose to obtain high spatial resolution (FWHM=0.14) CO and [CI] velocity maps, and 1.2 mm continuum observations on 4 dusty, compact SFGs at z~2 to answer the following questions: a) what are the kinematic properties of their molecular gas? (ordered rotation vs. large dispersion), b) is the molecular gas profile as compact as the stellar mass and SFR sizes (FWHM=0.2 and 0.14), c) do they have short quenching (gas depletion) timescales consistent with the rapid build up the quiescent population at z = 2?.',\n"," 'Scrutinizing the properties of AGN dusty molecular torus. We propose ALMA band 6 high angular resolution (<0.07\") HCN 3-2 observation of the nucleus of the prototypical type-2 AGN, NGC 1068. Our ALMA Cycle 2 data with 0.1\" x 0.2\" spatial resolution clearly identified compact dense molecular gas emission which is believed to be associated with the putative AGN dusty molecular torus, by separating from nearby spatially extended bright emission in the host galaxy. This is a very important milestone to scrutinize the properties of dusty molecular torus which are still poorly understood observationally. In this proposal, we aim to spatially resolve the compact torus molecular emission to investigate its dynamics and to obtain an important clue about its origin. Additionally, we aim to investigate the possibly detected emission in our ALMA Cycle 2 data which may bridge between the torus and bright eastern knot in the host galaxy, to confirm if we are witnessing molecular gas inflow from the host galaxy to the torus. Since our observing strategy is based on our available ALMA Cycle 2 data, the feasibility to accomplish our science goals is expected to be high.',\n"," 'Coordinated observations of Venus middle atmosphere with ALMA and AKATSUKI. The Japanese Venus orbiter AKATSUKI was successfully inserted into the Venus orbit on 7 Dec. 2015, and regular science operations just started in March 2016. This ALMA observation is proposed as a coordinated ground-based program to complement the AKATSUKI Radio Science (RS) experiments. We aim at revealing the thermal structure (together with the CO distribution and wind) of the dayside hemisphere of Venus middle atmosphere, which is not well understood from past observational studies conducted at much lower spatial resolution. Simultaneous Band-6 12CO and 13CO observations will enable us to constrain the thermal structure at altitudes 80-95 km, a vertical range that complements that of the temperature profile sounded by AKATSUKI RS. AKATSUKI RS can measure the temperature profile only at very localized areas, and therefore the high resolution mapping capability of ALMA will also be a strong support for interpretation of AKATUSKI RS data in terms of horizontal variation. Dates of AKATSUKI RS operation are restricted by the spacecrafts orbit. The period from March to early May in 2016 is the best, providing a unique opportunity to conduct collaborative observations using ALMA.',\n"," 'Nitrogen chemistry in Eta Carninae. Eta Carniae is one of the most extreme stars in the Universe. This source has underwent massive mass ejections which have formed a complex ejecta around this source: an external Oxygen rich cocoon, with an inner cavity splattered with Nitrogen-rich condensations, and in the innermost regions, the Homunculus nebula result of a 10 solar masses eruption in 1840. As expected from the nucleosysntesys models, this object presents an important Nitrogen enrichment. In addition to this, this enrichment presents a variation as we move further from the star. However, the origin of this variation is not clear. Only recently, the first molecules have been detected towards Eta Carinae, most of the corresponding to N-bearing molecules. We aim to complete this sampling of N-rich species, locate them, and resolve the different kinematical features observed in Single-dish observations. For this purpose, we ask for high angular resolution maps, with a S/N ratio reachable remarkably fast due to the expected strength of the selected lines.',\n"," 'A Search for Pyridine and Pyrimidine on TItan. We propose to search spectroscopically for the small cyclic molecules pyridine (C5H5N) and pyrimidine (C4H4N2) in Titans atmosphere using ALMA Band 6. The presence of pyridine is inferred from the detection of the C5H5H+ ion by the Cassini mass spectrometer (INMS) in the ionosphere. Other species first detected by direct sampling of the ionosphere (C3H6, C2H5CN) have later been confirmed spectroscopically in the dense neutral atmosphere (Nixon et al, 2013; Cordiner et al. 2015). Benzene, the only presently confirmed ring molecule, has been detected in both ionosphere and stratosphere. The detection of pyridine would be a major discovery in astrochemistry, since no N-substituted rings have previously been detected in space. The closely related molecule pyrimidine has profound astrobiological significance, as it forms the backbone ring for two of the four nucleobases (thymine and cytosine). This project, uniquely possible with ALMAs capabilities in ~4 hr of time, has the potential for making a major advance in our understanding of planetary atmospheres and for the formation of prebiotic molecules in astronomical environments.',\n"," 'Detecting the molecular CGM around an AGN at z=2. We request ACA observations of the CO(3-2) and [CI](2-1)+CO(7-6) line in correspondence of an X-ray selected AGN at z~2 that is part of the SUPER survey. Our previous ALMA and APEX observations of this source suggest the presence of molecular gas on scales of 40\", corresponding to more than 300 kpc. We propose to use the ACA capability at its best to confirm and increase the S/N of such detection, which would be the first detection of molecular gas on scales of 100s of kpc in an isolated galaxy (i.e. not a protocluster), out to the boundary between the circumgalactic and the intergalactic medium. The combination of the proposed ACA observations with our previous CO(3-2) data (resolution ~1\") obtained with the ALMA 12m-array will allow us to trace the molecular gas from the inner ISM-scales of a few kpcs out to scales of 100s kpc into the CGM, which is currently not available for any other galaxy at z~2. Furthermore, by combining these observations with our previous VLT/SINFONI observations of the ionised ISM and outflow in this target, we will study the link between kpc-scale outflowing features and the large-scale CGM.',\n"," 'Imaging the candidate binary SMBH in OJ287. We propose 1 mm EHT+ALMA observations of the BL Lac object OJ287, one of the best candidates for hosting a binary SMBH and to study jet formation in magnetically dominated AGN. The improvement in the north-south resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA and the comparison with quasi-simultaneous, resolution-matched 3 mm GMVA+ALMA and 1.3 cm space VLBI RadioAstron images will allow us to perform Faraday rotation synthesis and opacity analysis approaching linear scales of 26 Rs. This would allow determination of the spectral energy distribution in the jet and the three dimensional structure of the magnetic field to test the binary SMBH scenario and to test magnetically driven jet formation models. In particular we plan to i) search for a secondary VLBI core/jet to confirm the binary SMBH model; ii) determine the spectral properties of the central region; iii) determine the orientation and strength of the magnetic field, and the location of jet transition from Poynting-flux to kinetic energy-dominance; iv) resolve the Faraday screen of the accretion flow around the SMBH and the inner jet, and derive the mass accretion rate; v) discriminate between BBH model and rotation jet-model.',\n"," 'Evolution of ISM, Star Formation and Starbursts. We propose to extend our extremely successful program of measuring interstellar (ISM) masses in high-z galaxies at the peak of cosmic star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our technique uses optically thin dust emission as a proxy for the ISM gas mass -- calibrated using Planck observations of the Milky Way, nearby galaxies and SMGs at z ~ 2. The sensitivity and resolution of ALMA make the technique very quick and reliable (avoiding issues of CO conversion factors). In Cycle 2, we found very large increases in the ISM masses as one goes above the main sequence and at higher z. Confirmation of this important result requires observations of a larger and IR-complete sample. We propose 368 galaxies in the redshift ranges z = 1-2, 2-3 and 3-5 (43% with spectroscopic redshifts). All have good detections with Herschel, providing a reliable accounting of the dust-obscured star formation and AGN. These extensive samples will be used to map the evolution of ISM mass as a function of redshift, galactic stellar mass, and star formation rate relative to the main sequence. 59 of the galaxies have X-ray AGN to be compared with non-AGN samples.',\n"," 'Revealing Fragmentation of the Nearest Precluster Clump in Serpens South. The majority of stars form in clusters. Therefore, understanding the formation process of clusters is a key step toward a full understanding of how stars form. However, the initial conditions of cluster formation remain to be elucidated observationally because once active star formation is initiated, the stellar feedback such as protostellar outflows and radiation rapidly shapes their surroundings, making it difficult to track back the physical conditions of the clumps prior to active cluster formation, i.e., pre-protocluster clumps. On the other hand, recent 3D numerical simulations suggest that the physical conditions of pre-protocluster clumps determine some properties of forming clusters. Therefore, it is of great importance to reveal the physical conditions of the pre-protocluster clumps observationally. Recently, we discovered a NEAREST pre-protocluster clump that is located in the Serpens South infrared dark cloud (IRDC) at a distance of ~400 pc. Here, we propose a mosaic observation toward the nearest pre-protocluster clump with the finest spatial resolution of 1000 AU (~2.5\") and reveal its internal structure and physical conditions.',\n"," 'New method to dynamically determine stellar mass of young stars. We developed a new method to dynamically determine stellar masses of young stars by maximizing the autocorrelation between molecular-line data cube of their surrounding disks and various Keplerian rotational patterns. We have applied this method to the ALMA data of 13CO (3-2) of the young stars in Lupus. We successfully obtained 16 measurements of dynamical stellar masses. Our measured dynamical masses are consistent with the spectroscopically determined stellar masses within the 1-2 sigma uncertainties. In the current 13CO data, the on-source integration time is only 1 minute per source. With this limited integration time, we achieved an accuracy of 30%-50% in dynamical mass with our new method. However, this accuracy is not sufficiently high to calibrate stellar evolutionary models used in the spectroscopic method, which has a typical uncertainty of 10-20%. Thus, we propose ALMA observations of 25 stars with 5-10 minute integration per source to improve the accuracy of our dynamical mass determination by a factor of 2 to 3. Thus, we will make a statistically significant comparison between the two determinations and potentially even calibrate stellar evolutionary models.',\n"," 'Exploring New 183 GHz Megamasers in Seyfert 2 Galaxies. The exquisite sensitivity of ALMA in Band 5 has invigorated interest in identifying and studying new extragalactic water vapor megamasers at 183 GHz. The recent study by Pesce et al. (2023) demonstrates that 183 GHz megamasers can be commonly detected in galaxies already known to host 22 GHz megamaser disks. In this proposal, we seek to discover new megamaser galaxies - i.e. not previously detected at 22 GHz - by their 183 GHz emission. We have selected a set of 38 Sy 2 galaxies best suited for this initial study based on their distance, location on the sky, and visual magnitude. The discovery of new 183 GHz megamasers from this proposal will provide an immediate estimate of the ubiquity of this promising maser transition, identify new galaxies for supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements using ALMA, and motivate the development of future VLBI facilities for Band 5 observations. ALMA will thereby pioneer the use of the 183 GHz line as a new tool to investigate the physical conditions and geometries of accretion disks, probe SMBHs in active galaxies, and improve future geometric measurements of the Hubble Constant based on the megamaser method.',\n"," 'Fast outflows quenching star formation at high redshift. According to theoretical models, quasar driven outflows at high redshift clean massive galaxies of their gas content and quench star formation. We have recently discovered powerful AGN-driven outflows by studying the velocity field of [OIII]5007 in three quasars at z~2.4. The spatial distribution of the starforming regions in their host galaxies is anticorrelated with the presence of fast outflows, providing the very first evidence of quasar feedback quenching star formation. However, this evidence is tentative as it is based only on rest-frame optical spectra. We propose to map CO(3-2) to trace the distribution of the cold molecular gas in the three quasars, the only ones known so far showing evidence of outflows quenching star formation. The CO(3-2) maps will be compared with our [OIII] maps with similar spatial resolution: the molecular gas should be absent in the outflow dominated region, while surviving in the rest of the galaxy. This would be the first direct confirmation of star formation quenching by quasar outflows. Our ALMA observations will then open the way for the physical characterization of quasar driven feedback in larger samples of objects.',\n"," 'The far-infared [OIII] line emissivity of high-z low-metallicity galaxies. Herschel observations of nearby low-metallicity dwarf galaxies have shown that the [OIII] 88 micron line tends to be stronger than the [CII] 158 micron line, while the opposite is true for normal spiral galaxies at about solar metallicity. If this holds true also for the high-redshift Universe, the [OIII] 88 micron line from z=6--7 star-forming galaxies, which are expected to have sub-solar metallicities, should be detectable with ALMA in a few hours of integration time. Here, we propose ALMA observations of two spectroscopically confirmed z~6--7 galaxies to make the first [OIII] measurements for objects in the reionization epoch. The measured [OIII]-to-[CII] flux ratios will also allow us to study the metallicity and other physical conditions in the interstellar medium of these high-z galaxies.',\n"," 'Exploring the nitrile and oxygen chemistry in Titans middle atmosphere. Titans atmosphere is the place of a complex coupled nitrogen-methane chemistry, producing a wealth of hydrocarbons, nitrile and other species, among which oxygen-bearing compounds produced from an external source. The middle atmosphere (50-600 km) experiences strong seasonal modifications; currently an enrichment of several nitriles (HCN, HC3N) is being observed at all latitudes by Cassini. Heavier nitriles such as HC5N, C2H3CN have been also detected, but only in the upper atmosphere (1000 km), from in situ Cassini measurements. Here we want to explore the nitrile and oxygen chemistry of Titan from band 6 measurements at 223/238 GHz in compact configuration. The goals are (i) to search for the HC5N and C2H3CN millimeter lines to determine for the first time their abundances at 150-500 km, strongly constraining photochemical models, (ii) to measure the HCCC15N(27-26) and the HC13CCN(27-26) transitions, to derive for the first time the 14N/15N isotopic ratio in HC3N, thereby exploring the probable existence of a fractionation process similar to one observed on HCN and related to isotope-selective N2 photodissociation, (iii) to search for HCCNC, the isomeric form of HC3N, expected to be present given the recent Herschel discovery of HNC in Titans atmosphere, and (iv) to search for the yet undetected oxygenated molecule H2CO, to further improve our understanding of the magnitude and nature of the oxygen external source in Titans atmosphere. The science objectives, none of which can be achieved from Cassini, will bring new insights in the understanding of Titans complex chemistry.',\n"," 'Investigating the cause of Low-Frequency Turnovers in the SEDs of SFGs: Constraining the Thermal Emission. The physical mechanisms which govern the radio emission and infrafred-radio correlation (IRRC) in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) are well known but poorly understood. Radio emission from SFGs is often modelled using simple two-component power laws including thermal free-free emission and non-thermal synchrotron emission. However, recent low-frequency observations from the MWA GLEAM survey have found some SFGs exhibit much more complexity in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) including low-frequency turnovers and higher frequency kinks. These SED features are suggested to be primarily caused by free-free absorption in compact star-forming regions. A study of nearby SFGs including resolved analysis of their radio emission is therefore vital to being able to connect the physical mechanisms occuring within these galaxies to their SED features. With this understanding we will then be able to interpret the future data obtained by the SKA. We propose ALMA Band-1 and 3 observations to measure the thermal emission of a sample of 16 SFGs which includes low-frequency turnover galaxies and control galaxies to investigate the physical properties which cause differences in their SEDs.',\n"," 'The molecular cloud structure in the low-metallicity environment of 30 Doradus. Our understanding of how gas is converted into stars quickly deteriorates as the metallicity of the interstellar medium decreases. While molecular gas is commonly accepted to be the main star-forming reservoir in normal galaxies like our Milky Way, the difficulty in tracing molecules in metal-poor galaxies complicates our ability to evaluate the star-formation efficiency or even the mere importance of molecular gas in the star-formation process. We propose a detailed modeling of the photodissociation front and molecular cloud in the half-solar metallicity environment of 30Dor in the Large Magellanic Cloud, in order to quantify the total molecular gas mass and the fraction of this gas that is not traced by the usual tracer CO (the CO-dark gas). Thanks to our previous modeling effort using Herschel tracers at 10pc resolution, we have identified a optimized combination of ALMA tracers that will provide the sufficient constraints to achieve our goals at 0.1pc resolution, i.e., a scale small enough to examine the transition between physical layers in molecular clouds.',\n"," 'A detailed SZ study of a massive z=1.58 merging cluster. Cluster mergers play a fundamental role in the evolution of galaxy clusters. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of these dramatic events will require extending our observational window to high z, when mergers have a profound impact on the evolution of the observational and physical properties of galaxy clusters. For this reason, we propose to obtain the first high-resolution observations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect in the direction of the galaxy cluster XDCP J0044.0-2033, among the most massive known merging systems ever observed at a redshift z>1.5. Through a joint SZ/X-ray analysis, we aim at performing a detailed reconstruction of the thermodynamic properties of the system, practically unexplored at this redshift and at this angular resolution. This will allow for gaining an unprecededent insights into the processes shaping galaxy clusters in the earliest phases of their formation.',\n"," 'The origin of the non-thermal emission of the peculiar transient AT2018cow. The ATLAS survey has identified the peculiar transient AT2018cow, in a disturbed spiral galaxy at 60 Mpc. This transient has a multi-component broadband spectrum: It shows a very blue continuum, indicative of a very hot thermal component, a significant emission in X-ray and millimetre wavelengths, pointing towards a relativistic event, and an emerging broad-lined type Ic supernova component, typical of gamma-ray bursts. All this together make AT2018cow a unique event that may be originated from an unknown type of stellar explosion. We propose to use ALMA, in coordination with other ground-based and space observatories to study the broadband evolution of this first-of-its-type event.',\n"," 'Resolving the kinematic structure of a [CII] emitter 800 million years after the Big Bang. We propose deep, high angular resolution band 6 observations of [CII]158mum in a normal star-forming galaxy at z~7. This galaxy was recently spectroscopically confirmed through [CII] (at low angular resolution) and it is currently the brightest known [CII] emitter in the Epoch of Reionization. With our observations we will derive the kinematics of a galaxy in a very early stage of galaxy formation and we will test if this distant system is forming its stars in a well-ordered, gas rich disk or if the source is dominated by turbulent gas motion. We will furthermore investigate the morphology of the gas and dust and determine the offsets and spatial extend of these ISM components with respect to the stars that are visible in the rest-frame UV.',\n"," 'Rotation and Proper Motion of the HH 212 Jet. Protostellar jets are believed to be launched from accretion disks around protostars, carrying away extra angular momenta from the disks, allowing material to fall onto the protostars. Their launching radius and thus model (i.e., x-wind v.s. disk-wind models) are still uncertain but can be determined from their rotation and velocity, which can be measured with ALMAs unprecedented sensitivity and resolutions. HH 212 is a nearby (400 pc) well-defined Class 0 protostellar jet in Orion. It is almost in the plane of the sky, ideal for jet rotation and proper motion (thus velocity) measurements. We have mapped it at up to ~ 0.35\" resolution with the SMA, with tentative detections of jet rotation and proper motion. Since the jet is still not resolved across the jet axis, here we propose to map it again with ALMA to resolve it at a higher angular resolution in (1) CO J=3-2 and SiO J=8-7 and (2) CO J=6-5 and SiO J=16-15, in order to confirm and resolve the jet rotation and to measure the proper motion. If confirmed, the jet rotation will be the first one detected in star formation, hugely impacting the community. Our Cycle 0 proposal was accepted to observe this jet at the same resolution as in our SMA data in order to confirm our measurements. So far no data yet. Since the jet will not be resolved in Cycle 0, here in Cycle 1, we propose to observe it at twice as high of an angular resolution in order to resolve it. We aim not only to confirm, but also to resolve the jet rotation in order to better determine the jet launching model. In particular, we aim to check if the rotation velocity increases toward the jet axis as predicted in the current models.',\n"," 'Extending SPARKS: Exploring the origin of single high-mass protostars, and rich clusters. ALMA is the only instrument to revolutionize our understanding of the early evolution of high-mass protostars, which is one of the main open issues in todays astrophysics. In our Cycle 2 project, SPARKS, we targeted a homogenous sample of 35 objects from the most massive infrared-quiet clumps selected from the ATLASGAL survey. SPARKS has been very successful reaching its science goals: we discovered the highest mass young protostars with envelope masses up to 130 AU within 2000 AU scales, and revealed excellent candidates of high-mass prestellar cores. At the same time, SPARKS revealed very intriguing fragmentation properties: single high-mass protostars with very high core formation efficiency versus typically low-mass protostars forming clusters. It is clear that now we need to understand the origin of these extrem routes of fragmentiation, and to search for more examples of these extreme fragmentation are crucial. Since the number of the most massive infrared quiet clumps in the inner Galaxy is limited, the only possible way to search for them, is to complete and extend the sample of all infrared quiet massive clumps up to 4.5 kpc from ATLASGAL.',\n"," 'Molecular line polarization in circumstellar envelopes. Although maser observations indicate magnetic fields are ubiquitous around asymptotoc giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stars, their effect and origin are still unclear. It is often argued that maser observations probe locally enhanced magnetic fields. Only with ALMA will it be possible to study the magnetic field morphology in detail using thermal molecular line polarization. This will finally provide answers about the magnetic field morphology and will allow us to address the decade old debate concerning the apparent large scale field observed in OH maser regions. We propose to map the magnetic field using CO lines around two AGB stars (carbon rich IRC+10216 and oxygen rich R Leo) and the post-AGB star OH17.7-2.0 at 1\" resolution. CO polarization around IRC+10216 has previously been observed, at low resolution and sensitivity, using the SMA. However our ALMA observations will for the first time be able to resolve the actual field structure. OH17.7-2.0 has the clearest detection of a large scale field measured with OH maser to date which we will directly be able to compare with the magnetic field determined from polarized CO observations.',\n"," 'Dust nucleation in oxygen-rich envelopes of two evolved stars, VY CMa & Mira. Although dust plays a vital role in many astrochemical processes, its formation taking place around dying stars remains elusive. In particular, it is not understood how inorganic (non-carbonaceous) stardust is produced. The current nucleation theories predict that the first clusters (seeds) are formed from refractory oxides of Ti and Al, but these species remained undetected until very recently. We propose observations in which ALMA will spatially resolve the emission of TiO, TiO2, and AlO, which are the most important gas-phase species preceding the formation of seeds. The proposed observations will provide a direct view on the dust nucleation process in oxygen-rich stars. Two objects in which we have already detected the metal oxides will be observed: a red superiant, VY CMa, and an AGB star, Mira. They are prototypes of the high- and low-mass stars at the end stages of their evolution. In 6.9 h of total observing time, we will not only address the urgent questions about dust nucleation, but also shed more light on the mass-loss mechanism in late-type stars and solve some of the long standing problems about the nature of VY CMa, Mira and its companion.',\n"," 'Submillimeter Observations of a Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient. Luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) are a new class of cosmic explosions powered by active compact objects (magnetars or accreting black holes), the first new such class discovered in over a decade. Until recently, the only LFBOT with detailed multiwavelength observations was AT2018cow. AT2022tsd is the first LFBOT discovered in two years, and only the third LFBOT discovered in real time. Earlier this week, NOEMA obtained a strong detection at 280 GHz (350 GHz in the rest-frame), making this the most luminous LFBOT at submillimeter wavelengths. Submillimeter observations offer a unique diagnostic of energetic blastwaves. There is an extensive multiwavelength campaign to observe AT2022tsd across the electromagnetic spectrum, including Swift/XRT and 10-m class optical telescopes. To complement observations at lower frequencies (5-300 GHz), we request ALMA observations in Bands 6-8. The proposed ALMA observations, combined with decimeter to centimeter observations and Swift X-ray monitoring, will enable measurements of the circum-explosion density, the blastwave energy, and the microphysics of this most unusual shock.',\n"," 'SERENADE: Systematic Exploration at Reionization Epoch using Nebula And Dust Emission. ALMA has played a distinct role in z>~6 galaxy studies through its unique probe of FIR diagnostic emission lines such as [OIII]88um and [CII]158um, as well as dust continuum. The line ratio of [OIII]/[CII] is particularly informative because it reflects physical conditions of the ISM due to their different ionization potentials. Previous studies report redshift evolution of the [OIII]/[CII] ratio from z~0 to z>6 and its tentative correlations with galaxy properties, but these results are based on only less than 10 galaxies. Here we propose to conduct the first systematic program observing [OIII] and [CII] lines of 20 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at z~6, where Lya is visible and easily accessible from ground-based optical instruments, and both [OIII] and [CII] can be observed with ALMA. We will 1) measure [OIII]/[CII] ratios and its correlations with various galaxy properties (e.g., SFR, bolometric luminosity, Lya equivalent width) to study ISM physics and the escape of ionizing photons at the epoch of reionization, and 2) estimate dust temperatures using multi-band continuum observations to understand nature of some high redshift galaxies with very high dust temperatures.',\n"," 'The first millimeter observations of an \"orphan\" afterglow. AT2023lcr is the best \"orphan afterglow\" candidate to date, and could be the first member of a long-hypothesized but as-yet unobserved phenomenon: either an off-axis GRB, or a low-Lorentz factor dirty fireball. Three days after the initial optical discovery, a very strong detection was found at 10 GHz with the VLA. This is the first time a candidate orphan afterglow has such stringent constraints on associated prompt gamma-ray emission and such a bright radio detection so early in its evolution. Millimeter observations offer a unique diagnostic of relativistic blastwaves, especially via detection of the reverse shock. Given the bright radio detection, this event also has the possibility to become the first \"orphan\" afterglow studied at millimeter wavelengths. To complement the ongoing campaign to observe AT2023lcr across the electromagnetic spectrum, here we request ALMA observations in Band 3. The proposed ALMA observations, combined with approved centimeter observations and ongoing X-ray monitoring, will capture the forward shock (the afterglow) and the reverse shock, thereby enabling us to determine whether AT2023lcr truly represents a new class of explosions.',\n"," 'Probing the host galaxies of QSOs in the early Universe. We propose ALMA observations of the host galaxies of 4 spectroscopically confirmed z > 6 quasars from VST ATLAS to probe the scale and star-formation levels of the associated host galaxies. By measuring the [C II] and dust continuum emission in these galaxies in the early Universe, these observations will provide invaluable data for studying the environment which facilitates the growth to high masses of SMBHs at such early times. Indeed, our sample from the VST ATLAS consists of some of the brightest known QSOs at this epoch and thus the most extreme in terms of SMBH growth in the early Universe. With these observations, we will constrain the FIR-AGN luminosity ratio, which will provide new insights into the relationship between SMBH growth and star-formation. These observations will form a basis for both a larger sample of the brightest z > 6 QSOs with the future addition of further confirmed VST ATLAS candidates, as well as a basis for future high fidelity JWST programs.',\n"," 'Study of the first O-type swollen star candidate. Swollen stars are high-mass young stellar ojbects whose stellar surface is expanding due to active accretion on to them. While this phase of massive star formation is firmly predicted by models, no clear examples of O-type stars have been identified yet in such a phase. IRAS19520+2759 is, to our knowledge, the best swollen star candidate with a luminosity > 10^5 Lsun, given its particular optical spectrum, lack of centimeter emission, its associated collimated outflow and an elongated, dense structure seen in C18O emission that is oriented perpendicular to the outflow. However, the association of the mm source and the optical source remains to be confirmed, and here we propose 0.15 arcsec angular resolution observations of the continuum at 3 mm (comparable to HSTs 0.1 arcsec resolution in the optical) in order to determine the position and morphology of the mm source. In addition, we propose simultaneous observations of dense gas tracers well detected at 3mm with single-dish, in order to search for velocity gradients indicative of rotation/infall motions.',\n"," 'H2 spin chemistry constraints from redshifted NH3 ortho and para lines. The ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of H2 is a key parameter of the spin state and chemistry of interstellar H2, which impacts interstellar chemistry in general and even gas thermodynamic properties. It is difficult to measure directly the OPR of H2 in standard conditions of the interstellar medium, but it can be indirectly retrieved using observations of OPR of other hydrides like NH3. The high frequencies of the ground state transitions of ortho- and para-NH3 makes it difficult for ground based observations of Galactic sources, but they are readily accessible with ALMA for redshifted sources, like the extragalactic absorber at z=0.89 toward the lensed quasar PKS 1830-211. Here we propose to use this unique opportunity to further investigate and measure the NH3 OPR with an accuracy of 10% or better, rivaling all previous measurements, thanks to ALMA. Our proposed NH3 OPR observations promise unequaled constraints on the chemical and physical conditions and thermal history of its environment and, ultimately, will provide new insights on both the nuclear-spin astrochemistry and properties of the interstellar medium.',\n"," 'Characterizing a Kuiper Belt analog carved out by a newly discovered brown dwarf companion. We propose to obtain the first high-resolution submillimeter map of the debris disk surrounding the nearby young F-type star HD 50571. The disk has been marginally resolved by Herschel but its radial structure remains highly uncertain. Using the Gemini Planet Imager, we have recently discovered a brown dwarf companion interior to the debris disk, making this system an ideal one to empirically study the process of gravitational sculpting of a debris disk by substellar object. This process is often used to interpret asymmeries in high-resolution images of debris disks to infer the mass and orbital properties of unseen planets. However in cases where the perturber remains undetected, significant ambiguities remain in the analysis. Thus, ALMA observations of HD 50571 now offer us a unique opportunity to test our understanding of this process and for a perturber mass that has no equivalent in the Solar System. The results of these observations will therefore inform many other studies in this field, well beyond this particular system.',\n"," 'Circumnuclear Holes around Supermassive Black Holes. Galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are likely co-evolving, and the most accepted paradigm is an evolutionary process that involves self-regulating feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent high-resolution observations of nearby galaxies are revealing ~10-100 pc CO holes at their circumnuclear regions in 20 % of the galaxy, independent of their current nuclear activity. The origin of these circumnuclear holes are unknown, but their radii typically corresponds to the SMBH potential, suggesting that the SMBHs are the cause. If these holes are developed without powerful AGN, the SMBHs must be creating these holes through heating or dynamical effects. This suggests secular effects can impede accretion of gas, making it harder for AGN accretion to occur. To unravel the cause of these circumnuclear holes, we propose to observe the HCN(1-0), CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) lines in three galaxies with known CO(2-1) holes, to probe the presence of gas and analyse the physical state of the SMBH surroundings. The results will help to clarify the origin of circumnuclear holes, and thus will reveal direct evidence of their feedback even without a luminous AGN.',\n"," 'How do high-mass protostars assemble their mass in the Central Molecular Zone?. The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is a unique Galactic high-mass star forming environment, with physical conditions that are extreme compared to the Galactic disk, yet it is near enough that we can observe it on the scales of individual protostars. It is becoming clear that accretion disks play an important role in the formation of high-mass stars in the Galactic disk, but it is not known if this holds true in the CMZ, or whether the physical conditions may suppress the formation of accretion disks. Our previous ALMA observations have identified a high-mass protostar in the CMZ that is uniquely suited to investigating this question. The source is massive, young, and resides in a relatively unclustered region. It has a class II methanol maser, a bi-polar outflow, and shows signatures of rotation, providing tentative evidence for the presence of a massive disk feeding a massive protostar. We propose to observe this source down to scales of 250 AU to determine whether there is an accretion disk present, or if the formation of high-mass stars is fundamentally different in this extreme Galactic environment.',\n"," 'Establishing a timeline for the high-mass star-formation process. Studying the first stages of high-mass star formation is observationally demanding, because the entire early evolution takes place while the young stellar objects (YSOs) are embedded in their parent cloud. In recent years it has become possible to arrange high-mass star forming regions (HMSFRs) on a relative timeline. This, however, does not give any information on the actual age of individual YSOs. With the high-resolution obtainable with ALMA and (new) chemical models, one can better constrain the actual age of these objects. In cold, dense material molecules are locked onto grains, but evaporate into the gas phase at different temperatures, depending on the chemical properties of each species. When this happens their gas phase abundance increases drastically. With the continued heating by the YSO the evaporation fronts will expand making it possible to assign an age to individual YSOs, with the aid of chemical models that link the size of the evaporation region and the luminosity of the YSO to an actual age. We therefore want to observe selected molecules in HMSFRs in different evolutionary phases and compare the derived column densities with the model results.',\n"," 'Resolving the collision of supernova remnant N49 with a molecular cloud. LHA 120-N49 (N49) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the archetypical example of a supernova remnant (SNR) running into an interstellar molecular cloud. The shock manifests itself in X-rays, radio synchrotron radiation, optical and infrared fine structure lines and the heating and sputtering of dust grains, whilst the molecular cloud reveals itself by rotational emission from CO. Hence, N49 is one of the brightest SNRs in all of the Magellanic Clouds across the electromagnetic spectrum. Its position in the relatively unconfused Northern realms of the LMC lends it particularly well to a comprehensive and detailed study. One big obstacle to fully characterising the interaction is the absence of high angular and kinematic resolution images of the molecular emission. We propose to remedy this with ALMA maps of the CO and SiO emission at the collision interface at matching resolution to that of the extant multi-wavelength data. We will thus resolve the morphology, kinematics and excitation of the cloud collision and use - for the first time - SiO emission to trace the products of the sputtering of silicate grains and hence confirm the destructive nature of SNRs.',\n"," 'Heating of the quiet Sun chromosphere by two contrasting mechanisms. We propose to conduct a comprehensive search for the heating of the quiet Sun chromosphere at Bands 3 and 6 in coordination with optical, UV, EUV, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray observations. Our aim is to detect, for the first time in the same dataset, both transient bright features indicative of shocks that form as magneto-acoustic waves propagate in the chromosphere, and small-scale flare-like brightenings indicative of magnetic reconnection. The primary diagnostic to distinguish them will be their different temporal characteristics. We will compare the occurrence rates of the two types of heating events, and we will also compare their properties with those of similar events that will be detected by the instruments that will be co-observing with ALMA. These will be the first necessary steps to address the question on how often, when, and where different heating mechanisms take place.',\n"," 'ALMA Mapping of the Most Distant Galaxy Proto-Cluster Anchored by A Luminous Quasar at z=6.63. Simulations predict that luminous high-redshift quasars reside in the most massive halos and are tracers of overdensities, or proto-clusters. However, there has been no previous spectroscopic confirmation of porto-clusters associated with z>6 quasars. We recently discovered a candidate proto-cluster surrounding a z=6.63 quasar, traced by fifteen bright submm galaxies (SMGs) over a region of 4x6. With a single ALMA pointing centered on the quasar, we confirmed three galaxies at the quasar redshift by detecting [CII] lines, further suggesting this system is likely to be a proto-cluster. We propose to firmly confirm it as a proto-cluster by detecting [CII] of these SMGs with multiple ALMA pointings. Once confirmed, it will be the most distant proto-cluster yet known, and the first proto-cluster associated with a z>6 quasar. The ALMA observations will also map the star formation, measure the mass of the proto-cluster. In addition, we will perform high resolution [CII] observations and detect CO(7-6) and [CI] lines to measure the gas mass, the gas depletion time, and to constrain the excitation model of quasar host, enabling detailed studies of the assembly of this massive galaxy.',\n"," 'Submillimetre water megamaser tracers of supermassive black holes. Water megamasers are playing a crucial role in understanding AGN central engine physics, and in providing geometric distance measurements to their host galaxies for Hubble Constant determination. Although the megamasers have been well-studied at cm wavelengths (22 GHz), the scientific window for their study at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths is only just opening. Here, we propose to search the southern water megamaser galaxy NGC 4945 - already known to host water megamasers at 22, 183 and 321 GHz - for emission at nine water maser frequencies. Results of this work will inform which submm water masers are the strongest for extragalactic AGN central engine studies. In addition, it will reveal which lines are likely to be the best candidates for future mapping and distance determinations using mm/submm VLBI. The independent, purely geometric distances that could be obtained using mmVLBI can provide measurements of the Hubble Constant and black hole masses accurate to a few percent, of fundamental importance to cosmology and the understanding of AGN physics.',\n"," 'Lifting the Curtain in M87: From Accretion to Jet Formation. Understanding the processes of mass accretion and jet-launching in supermassive black holes (SMBH) is one of the central quests in modern astrophysics. The radio galaxy M87 contains the nearest and largest active SMBH, offering the best opportunity for probing the site of mass accretion and jet launching near a SMBH. Here we propose polarization imaging of M87 at 86 GHz with 7 Rs resolution, to determine the strength and topology of the magnetic field, detect the accretion flow and discriminate between two major jet launching scenarios (Blandford & Payne (BP) or Blandford & Znajek (BZ)). In combination with near-in-time space-VLBI imaging at 22 GHz (RadioAstron) and planned 230 GHz VLBI imaging (EHT), we aim to determine the frequency dependence of the polarization vectors, which in turn will allow us to determine the intrinsic B-field, corrected for Faraday rotation effects. Additional science goals are (i) the determination of the slope of the jet collimation profile, and (ii) the magnetization of flow and jet. The accurate measurement of the collimation profile will allow us to prove/disprove the reality of electromagnetic jet launching in M87 and help to determine the BH spin.',\n"," 'Warm and Dense Molecular Gas in Local Merging ULIRGs. Hierarchical galaxy formation scenario predicts that galaxy-galaxy interaction and merger are the fundamental process that govern the evolution of galaxies in the universe, changing the galaxy morphology and triggering intense starbursts and/or AGN activity. Recent high resolution simulations have shown that tidal interaction is responsible for forming massive clumps of dense gas surrounded by diffuse gas clouds and triggering star formation across the galaxy disks. An observational test of gas response requires mapping both the diffuse and dense gas tracers in merging U/LIRGs at high spatial resolution. Here we propose a systematic CO(3-2), HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3) survey of 6 of the brightest merging ULIRGs in the local universe at 0.3 arcsec (200 pc) resolution of ALMA Band 7. The primary aim of this study is to map the distribution and kinematics of warm/dense molecular gas and the dense gas mass fraction and interpret their relation to star formation and AGN activities in the context of the merger-induced response of the ISM in the progenitor disks.',\n"," 'Toward Understanding the Misalignment of Outflow and Jet from Protostars: Observation of the Warped Disk. The goal of this proposal is to understand the formation of the disk associated with the outflow and jet driving during the main accretion phase. For this purpose, we propose the observation of the disk/envelope and molecular outflow/jet in 5 line emissions: C18O J = 3-2, CS J = 7-6, HCO+ J = 5-6, CO J = 3-2 and SiO J = 8-7 and 0.9 mm continuum. Our target is the Class 0 object, MMS 5, which shows misalignment outflows and jets direction, at the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 (OMC-3). MMS 5/OMC-3 is the only object of detecting both outflow and jet, and misalignment of these direction with ~1,000 year after protostar formation or outflow/jet driving. Since the MMS 5/OMC-3 is extremely young, the only case is that the size of the jet is shorter than that of outflow. Our high-resolution and higher excitation observation results will reveal the warped disk structure, Keplarian rotation disk and inner jet structure within 20 au scale. Moreover, requested observed lines can trace infalling envelope and disk, and the jet close to the central source. Therefore, our proposal is important to understand the mass ejection, mass accretion and disk formation mechanism in protostar forming early phase.',\n"," 'Using Hydrogen Recombination-line Masers to Trace Disk and Wind Dynamics in MWC 349A. Disk winds are thought to play a critical role in star birth. As winds extract excess angular momentum from accretion disks, matter in the disk can be transported inward to the star to fuel mass growth. However, the observational evidence of wind carrying angular momentum has been very limited. We propose ALMA observations of a rare hydrogen recombination-line maser object MWC349A. The high signal-to-noise ratios made possible by the maser emission process and high spectral dynamic range of ALMA allow us to constrain the relative astrometry of the maser spots to 0.1 milli-arcsecond precision. By improving relative astrometry by one order of magnitude over the previous SMA and PdBI studies, this project will determine how angular momentum is transfered to the wind within a radius of 25 AU, and inform theoretical models of jets and outflows.',\n"," 'Characterizing the solar nebula analog MP Mus. The number of nearby, primordial circumstellar disks is very small, which significantly limits our current understanding of their evolution. We propose to observe the evolved disk around the nearby (100 pc) solar analog MP Mus, a source very similar to the famous TW Hya disk that is still mostly unexplored. Despite its age (8-15 Myr), MP Mus is surrounded by a gas and dust rich disk that may have a large cavity, as suggested by its SED and previous coronagraphic observations. We propose to perform a comprehensive characterization of this target with spatially resolved observations of its dust continuum emission at bands 7 and 4, together with 12CO(3-2) and 13CO(3-2) observations. These data will: 1) reveal the dust distribution of the disk around MP Mus and unambiguously identify the presence of a cavity, 2) probe dust growth and migration at different locations in the disk, 3) determine the gas distribution and mass, and 4) accurately estimate its gas-to-dust ratio. The proximity, age, and characteristics of MP Mus make it a perfect laboratory to better understand disk evolution and planet formation.',\n"," 'Exploring Dust Evolution and Sub-structure Formation in an Infant Disk around a Class 0 Protostar. Now it is well known that various substructures are formed in PPDs. However, their origin is still controversial. For instance, it is still unclear whether ring structures really mean planet formation. It is thus important to examine when and where dust coagulation and settlement starts during the disk evolution. In general, disks are not in hydrostatic-equilibrium (HE) in their early stages. Nevertheless, the infant disk in L1527 has a doubly flared structure, which can be regarded as a sign of the transition to HE. In this disk, dust growth and substructure formation has already started. Furthermore, the low alpha index (~1.6) and the asymmetry only seen in the central part (r<10 au) may suggest self-scattering, substructure formation, or existence of dark lane. To understand their origin and the change in the alpha index at the boundary of the inner and outer disks (r~50 au), we propose multi-band continuum observations. By combining the available Band 3 and 7 data with the Band 4 and 6 data, we will address the above questions. The origin of the asymmetry and the low alpha index will be explored by the Band 7 observation at a 3 au resolution.',\n"," 'Molecular line flux ratios and buried AGNs in merging ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Scrutinizing deeply buried AGNs in merging dust/gas-rich ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) is crucial to understand how supermassive black holes grow in mass in the universe, but has been hampered by large dust extinction. Observations at the almost dust-extinction-free (sub)millimeter wavelength can be a powerful tool, because an AGN and a starburst should produce different (sub)millimeter molecular rotational J-transition line flux ratios through different physical/chemical effects. We propose 0.1-0.2\" resolution HCN and HCO+ J=4-3 and J=2-1 line observations of ULIRGs which show elevated millimeter HCN J=3-2 emission at the nuclei where putative luminous buried AGNs are expected to reside. We aim to distinguish, based on multiple J-transition HCN and HCO+ data, whether the elevated nuclear HCN emission is due to (1) HCN abundance enhancement by AGN radiation/mechanical effects and/or (2) simply higher HCN excitation by dense and warm nuclear molecular gas. If we confirm that the first mechanism is primarily responsible, the enhanced HCN emission will be an even more solid indicator of luminous buried AGNs in the nearby and distant ULIRG population.',\n"," 'Multiplicity of brown dwarfs at the earliest evolutionary stages. The multiplicity properties of brown dwarfs (BDs) have been studied in the field and in star forming regions: BDs are normally found in tight binaries (sep < 20 au) with mass ratii close to 1. Are they born with these properties or/and are they the result of their evolution? To shed light on this topic, here we propose band 7 ALMA observations of 5 Class 0 proto-BDs, that is, BDs at the earliest stages of their evolution when they are still deeply embedded in their parental cloud. The main goal is to search for companions and compare the proto-BD binary properties with those reported in more evolved BDs. Note that non-detections will also help to put constraints on the binary frequency, separation range and mass ratio. The results will be compared with predictions from different models of BD formation, to check which of them can reproduce the observed properties.',\n"," 'Widespread SiO in IRDCs: Cloud-Cloud Collision Formation of Molecular Cloud Filaments?. Infrared-Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are filamentary molecular clouds believed to represent the initial conditions of massive star and star cluster formation. Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the filamentary structures observed for these clouds: shock-induced formation, flow-driven formation, cloud-cloud collisions ad magnetically-regulated formation. Among them, the cloud-cloud collision scenario predicts that already molecular clouds collide at velocities of some km s-1, yielding cold and filamentary IRDC structures. As a result, relics of the initial cloud-cloud interaction are expected. Recent single-dish high-sensitivity mapping of the SiO (2-1) line toward two quiescent IRDCs (Clouds H and G) shows that this emission is widespread over parsec-scales across both clouds. Here, we propose to image the emission of SiO (2-1) toward Clouds H and G to clearly establish whether this emission arises from the possible inter-shocked layer originated in the initial cloud-cloud collision, or whether widespread SiO is associated with a population of low-mass protostars that remain deeply embedded and undetected at all wavelengths toward these clouds.',\n"," 'Arp 220 Nuclear Disks at 50 mas Resolution. We propose ultra-high resolution (50uas, 20pc) imaging of Arp 220, the closest, brightest and best studied ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG). Our observations in the CO(1-0), (2-1) and (3-2), HCN(4-3), CS(7-6),(5-4) and (2-1) (all with their 13C isotopologues) and the dust continuum will resolve the gas structures and dynamics in the two (hypothesized) nuclear disks of this archetypical ULIRG. The observations will also place significant constraints on possible SMBHs. Indeed, our cycle 1 observations of Arp220 (Scoville et al. 2015), together with our extensive simulations, demonstrate that such extremely high fidelity observations are feasible, that will result in resolutions that exceed previous ULIRG observations by orders of magnitudes in beam area. Tracing a number of key diagnostic lines of the ISM will shed unprecedented insights in the inner workings of this prototypical ULIRG (gas densities, masses, outflows, gas dispersions), that hosts some of the most extreme star formation environments in the universe, both at low and high redshifts. Compact and extended configurations are requested to provide the required image fidelity at the superlative resolution of ALMA.',\n"," 'Confirming a z~6.9 Sub-mm Galaxy in COSMOS Hosting a Radio-Loud AGN. We propose Band 6 observations to confirm the redshift of a dusty, massive z~6.9 galaxy identified over the COSMOS field that shows multiple signatures of hosting a radio-loud AGN. We will employ a [CII]158mum scanning strategy has proven to be highly successful at spectroscopically detecting massive reionization-era galaxies with ALMA. Upon confirmation, this source will be not only the highest-redshift radio-loud galaxy yet discovered, but also the highest-redshift unlensed sub-mm galaxy (L_IR ~ 3e13 L_sol). Because this galaxy was selected over a relatively small field, confirming its high-redshift nature would suggest that radio-loud (non-quasar) AGN may be a significant accretion mode for supermassive black hole formation, helping understand how these objects formed so rapidly in the early Universe. Our observations will simultaneously provide morphological and kinematic maps of the gas and dust within this highly obscured system, constraints on its small-scale environment via serendipitous [CII] detections from ~50x lower-mass neighboring sources, and improved insight into contribution of dusty galaxies to the cosmic star formation rate budget at z>6.',\n"," 'Mira. The first AGB star in a triple system ?. Binary/multiple stellar systems, which are as abundant as single stars, are very interesting cosmic laboratories as they are related to many astrophysical phenomena. In the case of AGB (and post-AGB) stars, they are the most likely explanation for the shaping of non spherical PNe, a long standing problem. While many binaries are known in PNe, there are few examples in the previous AGB phase. Hydro models are available, but known orbital parameters for AGB binares are almost nonexistent. We propose to observe the closest bona fide binary with an AGB primary, Mira. The system is well studied and there are many indications that the system is in fact triple, and that the yet unseen component, Mira C, is strongly interacting with the AGB primary Mira A, affecting its pulsation and its mass loss. We claim that this third component is tentatively detected in public data from project 2017.1.00393.S, and we propose to perform a deeper integration in ALMA band 6, with 23 mas HPBW, in order to confirm this. At the same time we will also improve the values for the Mira AB orbit, obtain its mass ratio, and take a close look at how this triple system is shaping the AGB wind from Mira A.',\n"," 'Unveiling the ISM properties of a mature spectroscopically-confirmed lensed galaxy at z=9.1. The formation and early evolution of the first galaxies remains an outstanding quest in modern astronomy. In ALMA Cycle 4, our team spectroscopically confirmed a z=9.1096 gravitationally-lensed galaxy via [OIII] 88 micron emission in Band 7. Concurrently, deep X-shooter observations revealed Lyman alpha emission blueshifted by 450 km/s, suggesting this object is located in a large ionized bubble. The most exciting aspect which merits urgent follow-up observations is the prominent Balmer discontinuity seen in this, the most distant known ALMA source, which indicates the bulk of its stars may have formed as early as redshift z=15. We thus propose to exploit the newly-available Band 5 to determine the strength of [CII] 158 micron emission, thereby determining the gas phase metallicity of this mature system as well as the systemic redshift for future ALMA studies of further diagnostic lines.',\n"," 'Systematically Measuring CO Emission of Double-Barred Galaxies. We propose to initiate a systematic and reliable study on molecular gas in double-barred galaxies. The inner bar in double-barred galaxies is one of the mechanisms to drive gas inflow to fuel active galactic nuclei. However, it is still unclear whether and how much gas is needed to maintain a long-lived inner bar. Previous studies were unable to provide reliable results due to the difficulty to identify true double-barred galaxies and inadequate sensitivity and spatial resolution to measure the gas mass in the entire galaxy as well as in the inner bar region. To remedy this situation, we propose to obtain the CO line emission of ten double-barred galaxies which have been confirmed to have a unique feature in the stellar kinematics called sigma-hollows. This feature identifies them as true double-barred galaxies. Using these ALMA observations, we will be able to provide reliable constraints of the gas mass on theories to shed light on the formation of double-barred galaxies. Our data will also provide important information for future studies to investigate the gas properties in double-barred galaxies, such as the gas inflow rate, which require higher spatial and velocity resolution.',\n"," 'Outflows and infalling profiles in compact clumps: high-mass star formation in the Southern Outer Galaxy. We propose ALMA band 7 observations of 9 compact clumps in the outer Galaxy, associated with bipolar molecular outflows, at distances between 2 and 8 kpc. The sources are identified in our sample of HiGAL compact sources, and associated dense gas detected in CS(2-1). The sources present signposts of high-mass star formation in advanced evolutionary stages (massive young stellar objects and UCHII regions). Outflow emission was identified with APEX-2 observations at a resolution of 19\", and additional SiO observations at 217 GHz confirm the presence of shocked gas. We aim to characterise the outflow emission and velocity gradients of infalling material in spectra profiles at resolutions of 1.1 arcsec, up to 19 arcsec. The results will be compared with our previous ALMA results in the young molecular outflow / hot core G331.512-0.103. The proposed targets are among the most luminous sources found outside the solar circle, and constitute an unique laboratory for the study of complex molecules in the outskirt of the Galaxy.',\n"," 'From Hydrocarbons to Dust in Protoplanetary Nebulae. We propose to observe two carbon-rich protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe), CRL 618 and CRL 2688, to investigate the physical and chemical conditions that lead to complex hydrocarbon chemistry in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars after the AGB phase. These two transition objects are characterized by a different temperature, hence UV field, of the central star. Polyacetylenes and cyanopolyynes have been detected in both sources but benzene, the first aromatic ring, is only seen in CRL 618. Emission from carbon dust of mixed aromatic/aliphatic composition is only seen in CRL 2688. For both molecules and grains, UV-processing was invoked as a key process in driving the chemical evolution. We aim to reconcile these observational facts and get new insights into the gas and dust chemistry.The physical and chemical conditions are retrieved from studying HCCCN, CCH, HCN, CN, and CO. For CRL 618 we also observe HCO+ and a recombination line of Hydrogen to characterise its compact photodissociation region (PDR). Only with ALMA can we accurately probe the densest, smallest regions (at scales of 0.2 to ~1\") where the most active chemistry is expected.',\n"," 'M-Type Asteroids: The Remnant Core Fragments of Differentiated Planetesimals?. Remnants of large planetesimals that were collisionally fragmented early in the Solar Systems history remain today in the form of asteroids, providing a window into the early stages of planet formation. The class of high-density M-type asteroids have historically been thought to represent portions of the metallic cores of large, differentiated planetesimals. However, efforts to characterize their surface compositions have produced contradictory results; while radar albedos and thermal inertias indicate the smooth, dense surfaces expected for metallic compositions, spectroscopic features reveal the presence of silicates and even hydrated minerals. The linear polarization of thermal emission from a solid body is set by the dielectric constant and thus sensitive to the metal content of the surface, providing a new and powerful means for addressing the question of asteroid surface metallicity. We propose to map the continuum polarization of three asteroids that span purported compositions ranging from stony to metallic, in order to characterize the composition and metal content of the surfaces of M-type asteroids.',\n"," 'Compaction in Obscured AGN Hosts. The processes driving the co-evolution of galaxies and their super-massive black holes largely remain a debated issue in extragalactic astrophysics. Using HST imaging, we found that the radial I-band light profile of obscured AGN host galaxies at z~1 is more compact than that of star-forming sources at similar redshift and stellar mass, and that it is not due to the contribution of a passive stellar component. It could thus pinpoint an increased activity of central star formation possibly triggered by a phase of gas compaction. Indeed such AGN hosts are actively forming stars, but where this star formation occurs is still unconstrained. We thus request high-resolution ALMA Band 7 images to derive dust emission maps of 10 obscured AGN hosts. This will allow us constraining their star formation surface density without AGN contamination, and investigating if the spatial distribution of young stars follows that of the compact visible disk. We will address whether the obscured black hole accretion phase is related to galaxies experiencing a compaction of their gaseous component, which could play a key role in the final quenching mechanisms driving the formation of passive red sources.',\n"," 'The lensed quasar SDSSJ0924+0219: a unique flux anomaly. Quasars lensed by foreground galaxies are important because they allow us to measure microlensing effects caused by stars in the lens galaxy, and millilensing effects caused by 10^6 - 10^7 M(sun) CDM structures in the lens. Both effects cause flux anomalies, ratios of the lensed quasar images which cannot be explained by smooth lens models. SDSS~J0924+0219, in the optical, has one of the most drastic flux anomalies known in a lensed quasar, previously ascribed to microlensing: however, the anomalys persistence suggests that it may be due to CDM substructures in the lens. To definitively test this, we require observations at a wavelength where the background source is large enough to be immune from microlensing: ambiguity in cm-radio means that ALMA is the unique instrument which can do this, in a very small investment of time.',\n"," 'An ACA N+ survey of z=3-7 DSFGs from the South Pole Telescope survey. The South Pole Telescope (SPT) has detected at 1.4mm, ~100 bright (lensed), high redshift star forming galaxies from a 2500 degree^2 survey, with APEX/LABOCA and Herschel/SPIRE followup. For an unbiased subsample of 57 sources, we now have CO and [CII]-derived redshifts from ALMA Band-3 spectral scans, and APEX [CII] followup. We propose to measure the [NII] line in all 42 of these DSFGs lying at z>3, which have their [CII] lines measured (or being measured) by APEX, and can be reached in ALMA bands 6 or 7. These observations optimally use the ACA to get total flux N+ measurements for precision line ratios, and will provide a legacy database of the evolving distribution of C+/N+ from z=3-7 in a well characterized and unbiased sample of lensed DSFGs.',\n"," 'Resolving multiple ring structures in protoplanetary disks. We propose to obtain line and continuum observations of two protoplanetary disks, J1615 and HD97048, that show multiple rings in our high angular resolution optical scattered light images. We aim to understand the origin of these rings by resolving these regions with ALMA at a similar angular resolution (~0.06\"). By comparing the observations that on one hand, trace micron-sized particles (SPHERE/VLT) and on the other hand, probe mm-sized grains (ALMA), we will establish whether these rings are particle traps. We will determine the 3D geometry of the disks, which we expect to be strongly affected by planet-disk interaction, in particular in the case of J1615 for which we detected a planetary companion candidate. We will also constrain, through dust evolution models, the efficiency of dust trapping which is related to the strength of the turbulence in the disk.',\n"," 'Uncovering the gas reservoirs of absorption-selected galaxies. Decades of research using absorption-line techniques have characterized the physical properties of neutral gas in the Universe, and established a link between absorbers and galaxies. However, efforts to identify the absorbing galaxies themselves have been stymied by insufficient sensitivity and/or spatial resolution. We propose to use the ALMA Band-3 and Band-4 receivers to search for redshifted CO(1-0) or CO(2-1) emission from four high-metallicity, damped Lyman-alpha absorbers at z<1, the best current candidates for a search for CO emission. The proposed observations will allow us to (1) obtain the first detections of molecular emission in damped systems, (2) derive the star formation efficiency in the absorbers, by comparing the SFR with the molecular gas mass, and (3) compare the gas dynamics revealed through metal-line absorption, H-alpha nebular emission and CO molecular emission. This pilot program will establish whether deep sub-mm observations may provide mass, size, and dynamical constraints for high-z galaxies detected in absorption. This would represent the first, critical step to resolving the physical connections between HI gas in absorption and modern galaxies.',\n"," 'Identifying the Host and Physics of an Unknown Extragalactic Emission Line. We have discovered a population of emission lines in a blind spectroscopic survey that have no clear optical counterparts, lie at an unknown redshift, and arise from an unknown atom or molecule. The unknown lines were identified in the ALFALFA HI 21 cm survey, but they are neither 21 cm HI nor 18 cm OH megamasers. We propose an ALMA CO line scan of the brightest emitter. The primary objective is to obtain a redshift, detect mm continuum, and to associate the line with an optical counterpart. The lines are almost certainly non-thermal and represent a new molecular or atomic emission process observable at cosmological distances. One possibility is very high redshift hydrogen recombination line masers (theoretically predicted), but molecular masers associated with extreme starbursts or dusty AGN seem more likely. In order to uncover the nature of these mysterious emission lines, we request 3.7 hours of 12 m time to scan Bands 3 and 4 to obtain a CO redshift. Only ALMA offers the sensitivity and angular resolution needed to solve this mystery. Whatever these lines and their hosts turn out to be, ALMA will open new discovery space and reveal new astrophysical phenomena.',\n"," 'A Protoplanet Interacting with an Edge-on Circumstellar Disk. We have discovered a companion to a very young star using HST. The object is projected at the outer radius of an edge-on protoplanetary disk and appears coplanar with the disk. Keck AO photometry indicates the object has the same temperature as brown dwarf GQ Lupi B but with 10x less luminosity - consistent with a planetary mass object. Keck AO spectroscopy detects 2.12 micron H2 emission from the companion, confirming its youth and excluding a background object. We propose band 6 continuum and CO isotopologue observations to 1) measure spatial and velocity asymmetries in the outer disk and show that the gas there is moving in a two-body potential; 2) detect a separate disk around the companion; 3) use disk rotation curve(s) to derive the mass of the component(s); and 4) resolve the disk vertical structure. With a substellar spectral energy distribution, accretion signatures (the subject of a pending HST proposal), and the demonstration of gravitational interaction with disk gas, this object would be established as the leading example of an accreting protoplanet at 100 AU and offer support to models of planet formation by gravitational instability.',\n"," 'Chemistry in Feedback Environments in the Early Universe. Feedback is thought to be one of the main processes regulating star formation in its peak phase throughout the history of the universe. We here propose to use the key oxygen hydrides, OH+, H2O+, and H3O+, to probe the molecular ion chemistry associated with outflowing and infalling gas vs. material found at the active sites of star formation in four z>2.5 starbursts. Based on state-of-the art chemical modeling, we will measure abundances and column densities, as is critical to calculate mass/momentum outflow/infall rates and the local physical conditions in the absorbing layers. We will also study variations in the gas density in gas flows vs. systemic gas components, molecular fractions, and fractional ionization. We will link these findings to the star formation rates and their surface densities to search for spatially-resolved correlations. These measurements will be key to understand the nature of the turbulent gas entailed in the large-scale outflows and infall associated with massive galaxies in the early universe in their peak starburst phase, and how they impact the resulting stellar population seen in their present-day counterparts at the end of the mass buildup process.',\n"," 'Properties of the most distant star-forming GMC in the Milky Way. The properties of molecular clouds and star formation are expected to be subject to Galaxy-scale variations. In the Outer Galaxy, the importance of the spiral structure is thought to be diminished, with a metallicity gradient observed with galactocentric radius. Despite the importance of location in determining the outcome(s) of the ISM life-cycle, these effects are poorly understood. This leaves extrapolation from our current understanding to molecular cloud and star formation properties in even nearby galaxies uncertain, let alone to the conditions under which the bulk of stars in the Universe formed. We propose to comprehensively map and characterise the molecular gas and dust in the most distant star forming region found to date within our Galaxy, where the metallicity is expected to be significantly below that in the Inner Galaxy and supernovae may be more important than spiral arms. With these data, we will constrain the cloud properties (e.g. clump mass efficiency, column density PDF) at comparable resolution to single-dish observations of nearby star forming regions, thus providing the first step in bridging the gap between the Inner Galaxy and the nearby universe.',\n"," 'Molecular Gasdynamics in the Central Elliptical Galaxy of the NGC 5044 Cool-Core Group. The central elliptical galaxies of cool-core groups and clusters rank among the most molecular-gas-rich galaxies in the Local Universe. Such groups/clusters exhibit a strong central peak in their X-ray emission, indicating intensive cooling of the X-ray gas in the group/cluster core. In the absence of sufficient reheating by radio jets from their central galaxies, the gas in the group/cluster core should cool below X-ray temperatures and flow inwards (an X-ray cooing flow), thus depositing atomic and molecular gas in the central galaxy. In the only such galaxy so far mapped in CO, the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster, the molecular gas is distributed in radially-infalling filaments indicative of an X-ray cooling flow. Such molecular structures have not previously been observed in any other galaxy, and call to attention an important galactic-scale phenomenon yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we propose to image the molecular gas in the central elliptical galaxy of a cool-core group, NGC 5044. Unlike the Perseus cluster where the X-ray gas is reheated by a powerful AGN outburst from its central galaxy, in the NGC 5044 group gas reheating occurs through the cumulative effects of many weak AGN outbursts from its central galaxy as is more characteristic of cool-core groups/clusters. Our goals are to determine where the molecular gas in NGC 5044 is being deposited or dragged outwards, and through comparisons with the central galaxy of the Perseus cluster gain insights not possible from studies of one system or environment alone.',\n"," 'Determining the Physical State of Two Massive, Dynamically Ambiguous Galaxy Clusters. Galaxy clusters are vital probes of cosmology. Much progress has been made with the simple assumptions that they are relaxed and spherically symmetric, but high angular resolution X-ray observations from Chandra and XMM over the past decade and a half have revealed that clusters show a variety of deviations from this simple concept of equilibrium. More recently high angular resolution SZE observations have emerged as a powerful and complementary technique. In several cases high-resolution (~10\") SZE observations have identified very hot, 100-kpc scale regions of very well studied clusters which had previously been missed by modern X-ray observations. It is important to observationally quantify the prevalance and character of these disturbances to have a complete & accurate picture of galaxy clusters. MUSTANG SZ observations of Abell 611 and MACSJ1206-0847 showed low- to medium-significance hints of 100-kpc scale hot gas. These clusters also showed a mix of other dynamical markers. We propose here to conclusively unveil & characterize these features with 5\" - 10\" resolution, targeted SZE imaging using ALMA Band 3.',\n"," 'In search of the high HCN/HCO+ ratio origin in AGNs: SiO imagings of Seyfert galaxies down to 15-30 pc scales. The origin of HCN enhancement in AGNs, which can be seen in high HCN/HCO+ ratio, is still far from well understood. Now ALMA reveals much higher HCN/HCO+ ratios found in the circumnuclear disks (CNDs) rather than the exact AGN positions, which raises a scenario that HCN is enhanced by mechanical heating such as shock of jet/outflow from AGNs (MH scenario). The immediate objective is thus to verify the MH scenario by revealing the distribution of shocked gas at high spatial resolution down to sub-CND scale. Here we propose unprecedented 15-30 pc resolution imagings of SiO J=6-5 line, a good shock tracer, toward the two distinct CNDs of nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 and NGC 1097. We aim to achieve the following science goals, which will be observational evidence to verify the MH scenario: 1. Do SiO and HCN arise from the same regions in the CNDs? --- We will confirm whether the distribution of SiO and HCN have spatial correlation or not, regardless of AGN activities of these galaxies. 2. If so, are SiO and HCN really enhanced? --- We will then compare SiO/H13CO+ and H13CN/H13CO+ ratios to confirm whether these are enhanced at the same region found the above science goal.',\n"," 'Magnetic field structure at the onset of high-mass star formation. It is strongly debated which physical processes dominate the initial fragmentation and collapse at the onset of star formation, and how much gravity, turbulence and/or magnetic fields contribute. While pre-ALMA magnetic field studies were limited to large spatial scales or low sensitivities, ALMA for the first time offers the opportunity to study weaker polarization signals during the earliest evolutionary stages at high spatial resolution. Therefore, we propose to investigate one well-studied infrared dark cloud (dark at 70 & 100mum) IRDC18310-4 where the turbulent properties are known from previous observations. These ALMA polarization data will reveal the magnetic field structure and strength in the plane of the sky, as well as its derivatives, i.e., the mass-to-flux-ratio and the turbulent to magnetic energy ratio. These parameters are crucial to characterize the stability and differentiate the importance between turbulence and magnetic field. We stress that this will be to the authors knowledge the first high-resolution magnetic field study at the onset of high-mass star formation and hence serve as a template for future more statistical studies of larger samples.',\n"," 'High-resolution observations of a resolved AGN-SMG normal, main-sequence merger at z 5.

The observations will allow us to determine the dynamical state of the two colliding galaxies and map the [CII] associated to the merging galaxies and debris surrounding material, including a spectacular 20 kpc tidal tail. We will determine what is the impact of the merger event on the host galaxies and study regions of enhanced [CII] emission. We will also compare the physical conditions of the gas and dust to those observed in local systems. Finally, we want to complement the [CII] observations with a low resolution, Band 6 exploration of the [NII] line in view of possible future ALMA follow up of this line.',\n"," 'Characterizing multiple polarization mechanisms in the bright, inclined disk of IM Lup. This is a follow-up of our successful Cycle 4 ALMA polarization observations of the large, bright, inclined protoplanetary disk IM Lup. Our Band 7 observations, published in Hull et al. (2018), show a polarization morphology consistent with dust scattering. Here we propose to observe IM Lup in both Band 3 and Band 6 in order to characterize the polarization at longer wavelengths. The results in HL Tau by Stephens et al. (2017) show radiative alignment dominating at Band 3; scattering at Band 7; and a superposition of the two at Band 6. We aim to test whether the transition from scattering to radiative alignment is the same for an optically thinner and significantly more evolved Class II source like IM Lup.',\n"," 'Corona Australis Disk Zoo. The well clustered young stellar objects (YSOs) concentrated to the nearby (130 pc) molecular hub-filament system, Corona Australis (CrA), are by far the least explored by millimeter interferometry owing to the -37 deg Decl. Their wide ranges in disk initial conditions, ambient environments, and evolutionary pathways are ultimately linked to a diversity of planetary systems. The proximity of CrA now permits taking full advantage of ALMAs imaging capability to survey a large number of YSOs with good sensitivity and spatial resolution. We propose to resolve the gas and dust content of all 43 known protoplanetary (Class II) disks in this region with a ~0\".24 (30 AU) beam. We will make impact to the community by revealing fundamental disk properties including the dust/gas density profile, morphology (cavity, azimuthal asymmetry, and multiplicity), and gas motions including rotation, radial flows, and jet/outflow, in great details. These statistically significant, unbiased and homogeneous disk samples will achieve a mass sensitivity to 0.1 Jupiter massse in dust, and ~<0.3 Jupiter masses in 13CO/C18O line ratio, which will define a realistic parameter space for planet formation models.',\n"," 'Physical and Chemical Transition from the Envelope to the Disk in the Hot Corino Source IRAS 16293-2422. IRAS 16293-2422 is a well-studied Class 0 protostar, and is known as a typical hot corino harboring rich complex organic molecules (COMs) such as HCOOCH3. We have recently found an infalling-rotating envelope (IRE) in Source A of this source by analyzing the ALMA Cycle 1 archival data, and identified its centrifugal barrier with the aid of a simple ballistic model. A drastic chemical change is also found in this source: OCS traces the IRE, and CH3OH the centrifugal barrier, and H2CS the entire region from the envelope to the inner disk component. The Keplerian disk component is suggested by the high velocity component of the H2CS lines. However, the Keplerian rotation is not confirmed on the basis of the kinematic structure because of the limited resolution. To overcome this situation, we here propose higher angular resolution (0\".07) observations to characterize the structure and dynamics of the Keplerian disk and the transition zone from the IRE to the Keplerian disk. These observations will address a long standing question how the disk structure is formed and what the hot corino is. Thus these observations have a substantial impact in astrochemistry and astrophysics.',\n"," 'A survey of deuterium chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Protoplanetary disks links protostars and Solar System bodies physically and chemically. Deuterium fractionation is one of the most common tools to probe how these different stages are connected. Deuterium fractionation in molecules can for example be used to infer the importance of cold chemistry for different volatiles in the Solar System, including the Earths sea water. The utility of deuterium fractionation as a probe is currently limited, however, by few, and seemingly contradictory observational constraints on the deuterium chemistry in disks; the spatially resolved fractionation pattern seems radically different both between molecules and between the two most well-studied disks, TW Hya and hD 163296. We propose to carry out a modest (6 source) survey of deuterium fractionation in disks that span a range of stellar and disk characteristics to explore (1), the variability in deuterium-enrichments during planet formation, and (2), the link between this variability and disk structures, ages, and impinging radiation fields. This would provide the strongest constraints to date on how the deuterium chemistry evolves between the protostellar stage and the mature Solar System.',\n"," 'Probing low-mass star formation in the CMZ in Sgr B2 Deep South. Star formation in the Galactic center is lower than expected given the high mass of dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ). The physical conditions required to drive star formation are therefore clearly different in the CMZ than in the local Galactic disk: overall gas temperature, pressure, and density are much higher. We propose a survey of the only known region of ongoing, widespread star formation in the CMZ, Sgr B2 Deep South (DS). Sgr B2 DS is part of the broader Sgr B2 cloud, but unlike the famous cluster-forming sources Sgr B2 M and N, DS has an extended filament containing hundreds of star-forming cores. We will measure the masses of pre- and protostellar cores down to 0.3 solar masses, deep enough to measure the turnover point of the core mass function. This measurement will provide the best sample for quantitative comparison between Galactic disk and CMZ star formation, thereby establishing an empirical foothold for extrapolation to more extreme conditions in other galaxies.',\n"," 'The parsec scale view of the starburst ISM through molecular diagnostics. Extreme activities in starburst galaxies have a direct impact on their molecular interstellar medium (ISM). These effects on the ISM are most prominent in the vicinity of young stellar clusters on parsec-scales, dominated by feedback in the form of heating and outflows. Thanks to its proximity and brightness, the starburst galaxy NGC 253 allows for the most detailed studies of the ISM in a starburst environment using (sub-)millimeter molecular lines. These lines are an effective probe due to their large penetration depth. Using measurements of a variety of molecular diagnostics, we will study the molecular cloud physical properties, the chemical composition caused by various heating sources, extreme excitation conditions, and cluster-scale outflows. We intend to perform a spectral scan in Bands 6 & 7 with 0.2\" resolution in the central 15\" of NGC 253 to cover all transitions of interest. Short spacing information is already available from our Cycle 5 project. Our spectral scan will efficiently reveal the highly excited physical conditions and signatures of feedback in the nearest starburst galaxy NGC 253.',\n"," 'Water and Organic Molecules in Yound Bursting Object. We propose to observe the transition lines of water and organic molecules at ALMA band 7 towards a protoplanetary disk around young bursting object, FU Ori. FU Ori type burst is thought to be important in terms of thermal history of materials in planetary systems, including our Solar system. The burst phenomena affect the location of water snowline, distribution of water-containing solid materials, and also composition of organic molecules in the disk. Our chemical reaction network calculations together with line radiative transfer calculations, based on the detailed physical model of the disk, suggests that the proposed H2O lines are suitable to locate the water snowline in the disk (Notsu et al. 2018). By analyzing the line profile under an assumption of Keplerian motion, we will be able to locate the snowline spectroscopically even without spatially resolving the line emitting region. Meanwhile, many complex organic molecular lines have been detected towards FU Ori type objects recently. Our proposed observations of complex organic molecules together with the H2O lines give us information on organic molecule formation around the water snowline.',\n"," 'Ghost vs. Zombie Gas: Determining the Primordial vs. Secondary Origin of CO in Evolved Circumstellar Disks. The sensitivity of ALMA has revealed the presence of molecular, CO gas in three evolved disk sources. These are several Myr-old low-mass stars that appear to have lost their protoplanetary disks given their low IR and mm-dust emission. The origin of their CO gas is unclear. Is it lingering \"ghost\" primordial gas left over from the earlier protoplanetary disk stage? Or is it second-generation, revived \"zombie\" gas released via collisions and/or outgassing of volatile-rich planetesimals? These two scenarios present different expectations for the gas composition. Primordial gas would be H2-rich, similar to protoplanetary disk gas. In contrast, secondary gas would be dominated by H2O and CO, similar to comets. We aim distinguish between these two scenarios by searching for N2H+, as a tracer of its requisite precursor H2. We propose to observe the N2H+ J=3-2 transition in NO Lup, TWA 34, and TWA 7. Detections of N2H+ will reveal the presence of H2-rich, primordial gas whereas non-detections will favor the secondary gas scenario. The results of this analysis will provide valuable data regarding the dissipation timescale and planet-forming lifetime of protoplanetary disk gases.',\n"," 'Shadows in time: resolving disk surface chemistry using inner disk shadows. Many chemical processes in the interstellar medium happen under conditions and on time-scales that cannot be easily probed with laboratory experiments here on Earth. However, protoplanetary disks can serve as excellent laboratories for astrochemistry as their geometry and physical conditions are well understood. In some protoplanetary disks, an inclined inner disk casts a shadow over half of the outer disk. This shadowing drastically changes the UV field in the surface layers of the disk. As disk material rotates into and out of this shadow on Keplerian orbits, we can use it to resolve the chemical evolution of material on 10-1000 yr timecales. This will allow us to infer reaction rates under astrophysical condtions. We propose to take this unique laboratory out for a spin to study the radical chemistry of CN and the ion-molecule chemistry of HCO+.',\n"," 'Resolving water emission in the early universe. We propose to detect and image water lines and infrared luminosity in three lensed starforming galaxies at z~3 from the SPT survey. With the lensing, we will achieve 1 kpc spatial resolution in the source plane. This will be the first time water is spatially resolved in galaxies at high redshift. We will test the recently observed and remarkable linearity of the L_H2O/L_IR correlation.',\n"," 'Searching for the Smoking Gun of Magnetar-Powered Super-Luminous Supernovae. Nascent strongly magnetized neutron stars (so-called magnetars) with rapid rotation have been considered to explain optical emission of super-luminous supernovae. They also give us a unified picture of stripped-envelope supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and even fast radio bursts. Pulsar wind nebulae are known to be efficient accelerators of electrons and positrons, so non-thermal synchrotron emission from the nascent nebulae is naturally expected. We propose to observe two super-luminous supernovae, SN 2015bn and SN 2016ard, with ALMA. Contrary to low-frequency radio emission that is largely suppressed by free-free absorption, submm synchrotron emission serves as a smoking gun of magnetars hidden in the supernova ejecta. A successful observation will provide us with the first evidence for a magnetar-like central engine as well as a clue to progenitors of fast radio bursts. Even non-detections will set stringent constraints on the magnetar-powered supernova model.',\n"," 'Sulfur and water mapping in the mesosphere of Venus. We propose to map sulfur and water in the mesosphere of Venus, using the SO2 transitions at 336.089 GHz and 346.652 GHz, the SO transition at 346.528 GHz and the HDO transition at 335.395 GHz in order to study the latitudinal and day/night variations of these species. In addition we will observe the CO (3-2) line at 345.795 GHz which will constrain both the thermal profile and the CO vertical distribution and will be used for wind mapping.',\n"," 'Resolving the complete outflow density and kinematics structures by observing [CI] (1-0). We take the advantage of the newly available, ACA stand-alone observational capability at Band 8 to propose high sensitivity, high signal-to-noise ratio(S/N) observations of the [CI]3P1-3P0 emission line in the local molecular outflows. We aim to explore the capability of the [CI](1-0) line to trace the outflow mass and compare it with the more commonly employed CO line gas tracers. Our survey will address the doubts raised from earlier outflow analysis by CO due to advantages of [CI](1-0), i.e., optically thin, simpler energy-level system, and low self-absorption. Our analysis will leave a rich legacy for future ALMA research beyond its justificataion on [CI](1-0) as a molecular outflow tracer. [CI](1-0) is a potential magnetic field tracer with the maximum polarization more than 20%. The survey of [CI](1-0) intensity in the outflow near FUV radiation helps to source selection for future atomic polarization measurement on interstellar magnetic field.',\n"," 'Statistical nature of the class I CH3OH maser clumps in high mass star-formation. We propose high-resolution molecular line observations toward 44 GHz class I CH3OH maser sources to investigate the physical environment of shocked regions traced by 44 GHz class I CH3OH masers.Previous interferometric studies of Class I CH3OH masers suggests that the masers trace the shocked gas in the dynamical structures in star forming region, such as outflows, HII regions, and the cloud-cloud collision. However, the detailed kinematics and physical environment of the region where the masers arise are still unclear due to the scarcity of high-resolution data of shock tracers and masers. From 2013, we started observations of 15 MYSOs associated with 44GHz CH3OH masers with KaVA, and this sample will give a unique chance to study the detailed information of physical environment of the shocked regions where maser arises by comparing high-resolution observations of shock tracers to VLBI images of masers.We will observe CO and H30a to trace the outflows and HII regions, SiO to trace shocked molecular gas.to compare the physical properties of shocked region with each maser features observed with VLBI, the high-spatial resolution and the high-sensitivity of ALMA is inevitable.',\n"," 'Probing Electron Acceleration Mechanism in Nearby Core-Collapse Supernovae. Identifying the site(s) of the particle acceleration and cosmic ray production has been an intensively studied field of particle astrophysics. The most promising mechanism requires the existence of a strong shock wave - in the standard scenario (`diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism), particles gain energy through repeated collisions between up- and down-streams of a shock wave. There is however a key issue in this picture – how the particles are injected into the acceleration site. This is especially a big issue if one considers electrons, known as the `electron injection problem’ – due to the small mass and small gyro radius, they are not easily able to cross the shock wave as is required by the DSA mechanism unless their energies exceed at least 100 MeV. Exploring how the electrons behave around this energy scale at the shock front is of essential importance to clarify the acceleration mechanism of electrons. Studying synchrotron emissions from young supernovae (SNe) sheds light on the issue. The hydrodynamic interaction between the expanding SN ejecta and circumstellar materials (CSM) creates a strong shock wave, accelerating electrons, producing synchrotron emission, as is similar to SN remnants. Young SNe are however unique in an observational potential as compared to SN remnants. Due to strong magnetic field content at the shock (an order of Gauss), for given frequency we can probe electrons with much lower energy than in SN remnants (in SN remnants, radio emissions are produced by electrons with the energy > 1 GeV). Indeed, radio observations (in cm wavelengths) of nearby young SNe have shown that the acceleration is not as efficient as predicted by the DSA mechanism in the energy below ~ 100 MeV. We propose ToO observations of one nearby core-collapse supernova (SN) at Band 3, 6, and 7 in three epochs – the first observations at about three weeks after the explosion, and then additional two epochs separated by about 3 weeks each. The total observing time including the overhead is estimated to be 7.3 hrs (Note that the time estimate by the OT is for a single epoch). A main goal is to constrain the electron acceleration mechanism at a shock wave. The synchrotron emission from young SNe in the ALMA bands probes the relativistic electron population at the energy of ~ 100 – 500 MeV, which has been unexplored in similar environments (SNe and SN remnants). In this energy range, we expect to see for the first time a transition from inefficient to efficient acceleration in the standard DSA theory of the particle acceleration. The multi-band and multi-epoch observation is essential, as we want to identify the characteristic frequency of the `transition’ which (monotonically) changes with time. If this is identified, it provides not only a solid confirmation of the DSA mechanism for electrons, but also a strong clue to solve the electron injection problem. For the proposed set up, we expect one or two candidates every year within reach by ALMA. Our goal is not reachable by other telescopes, and ALMA is a unique telescope to investigate the so-far unexplored mm/sub-mm properties of SNe. In addition to the study on the acceleration mechanism, the ALMA data will also be used to address astrophysical properties of SNe, e.g., the shock velocity and the circumstellar density connected to the explosion mechanism and progenitor evolution.',\n"," 'Searching for complex organic molecules in Orion cold cores. Interstellar complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to be formed on warm grains (>30 K) and desorpted at high-enough temperature (>100 K). The detection of COMs in starless cores such as L1544 challenges the existing chemical model. Many chemical models were put forward to explain this, but mostly are not well constrained by enough observations. Previous observations were mainly conducted using single-dish telescope and biased to individual famous cold core. We propose to conduct ALMA ACA observations in Band 3 towards 16 candidate prestellar cores in Orion in several transitions of COMs, CH3OH and N2H+. With these data, we will for the first time systematically study the spatial distribution and segregation of COMs in cold cores, and their connections to evolutionary statuses. These informations are essential to constrain the chemical models of COMs.',\n"," 'The molecular gas content of the host galaxies of Fast Radio Bursts. The inability to localize the radiation from fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been the key stumbling block to unravelling the origin of their enigmatic emission. Over the last few months, the Australia SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) has obtained sub-arcsecond localization of three non-repeating FRBs, FRB180924, FRB181112 and FRB190102. Our optical imaging and spectroscopy have identified the FRB host galaxies, at z=0.3214, z=0.4755, and z=0.291, respectively. The 0.1-0.5 accuracy of our radio positions presents an outstanding opportunity to directly examine the progenitor environments of a sample of FRBs and trace the conditions that give rise to the bursts. Mapping the CO emission from the FRB host would allow us to test from the CO velocity field whether the FRB arises from a cataclysmic event. As the first step towards this mapping, we request ALMA Band-6 time to observe the CO J=3-2 emission from the three FRB host galaxies to measure their molecular gas content and star formation efficiency.',\n"," 'Late follow-up of the unique GRB171205A. GRBs are powered by compact objects that eject matter at ultra-relativistic velocities. This makes them ideal laboratories to study radiation processes in extreme conditions. Swift has detected >1000 GRB afterglows but only 20-30 were bright enough for extensive follow-up from radio to X-ray wavelengths to provide crucial constraints on the radiation processes. GRB171205A was a unique event, being the 4th closest long GRB to date and the second brightest in millimeter wavelengths. We have already started an extensive observing campaign between 600 MHz and X-rays. For the first time we have the opportunity to follow an event in millimeter wavelegths for over a year and explore the late deceleration of the afterglow and the transition to a non-relativistic phase. Combining data over a very long time in multiple frequencies will allow us to accurately measure the energetics of the event, precisely test the models, and characterise any non-standard radiation components. This is a short and easy to execute programme with only two continuum observations in Band 3.',\n"," 'CO spectroscopy for remarkably luminous Lyman break galaxies at z=6.030-6.203. We propose Band 3 observations for three remarkably luminous spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at z=6.030-6.203, whose [CII] and dust continuum emission have been detected in our recent ALMA observations. This proposal aims at detecting their CO(6-5) emission and characterizing the properties of molecular gas components in SFGs at high redshifts, which has been poorly investigated in previous studies. We have two science goals: 1) Detecting CO emission lines from normal SFGs beyond redshift 6 for the first time and 2) Examining the redshift dependence of the gas depletion time in SFGs up to this high redshift. Even an extreme case of no CO detection is interesting, because such a result would suggest that invalidities of the empirical relation and/or the theoretical models, which need to be tested for high-z sources. This ALMA program will be a precursor study of our systematic survey for investigating the molecular gas properties of normal SFGs at high redshifts via CO emission line spectroscopy, which will be complementary to other studies targeting nebular fine-structure lines from high-z SFGs.',\n"," 'A Breakthrough in Measuring SMBH Masses in Type II AGNs: ALMAs Potential?. We propose a high risky high impact project to test the ability to measure masses of SMBHs in type II AGNs with ALMA, which may open a new window for such studies. The directly measured line width of the radio recombination lines, with the combination of the broad line region size derived with AGN luminosity, can offer a critical constraint of the black hole masses in type II AGNs. We select Circinus, the nearest type II AGN with known broad line width (~3300 km/s), and apply to observe H35a (147 GHz) and H36a (135 GHz) simultaneously with the band 4 receivers. If we can detect such lines and determine the line width in Circinus with two hours on-source time at cycle 2, it is possible to systematically survey the masses of SMBHs in type II AGNs when ALMA is fully commissioned. If it is not successfully, we have to wait for JWST to do mid-IR spectroscopy observation, which will still suffer from the continuum contamination from the torus. We obtained a ranking with 20%-40%, which was assigned as a filler project during Cycle 2. If it can be scheduled in Cycle 2, we will not request re-observation for this project.',\n"," 'Dense Gas Properties within 40 pc of a Super Star Cluster. Super Star Clusters (SSCs) are some of the most extreme examples of star formation in the Universe. This mode is important when star formation gets very intense, especially at high redshift, but is quite rare in the local Universe. NGC 5253 is the nearest example of a young SSC (proto-globular cluster). At 3.5 Mpc, we can be study the ISM - SSC connection down to within ~10 pc of a 2 Myr old, 10^9 Lo star cluster. Capitalizing on our previous ALMA observations that detect HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) in this low metallicity dwarf starburst for the first time and find very anomalous gas properties, we propose to observe HCO+(3-2) and HCN(3-2) simultaneously at sub-arcsecond scales to map out the ISM properties in the SSC environment. The goal of the project is to constrain the ~10 pc scale structure and kinematics of the dense molecular component and to determine dense gas excitation at ~40 pc scales. This will provide the closest look at the influences of SSC feedback on its molecular environment.',\n"," 'Hot or Warm? What are the dust temperatures of normal star-forming galaxies at z~7?. We propose to observe the rest-frame 90um dust continuum (Band 8) to determine dust temperatures of six z~7 galaxies. We will probe the peak of the infrared emission, which directly offers a constraint on the luminosity-weighted dust temperature and provides an accurate estimate of total infrared luminosity. Our observations will resolve the unsettled debate regarding the trend in the evolution of dust temperature at z>4, whether it continues to rise or it flatten. This will give us an insight into how dust properties evolve at high redshift, and lead to a better understanding of what drives the efficient growth of the dust mass in the first billion years of the universe. Together with the existing [CII]158um and rest-frame 160um data (Band 6), we have designed the observations to obtain the dust temperature with an uncertainty as small as +/-3K. Our targets are a subset of the spectroscopically confirmed sample of the first ALMA systematic [CII] survey of normal star-forming galaxies at z>6.5. The combination of our observing strategy and the unique z~7 targets offers a rare opportunity to stringently determine dust temperatures and their evolution in the early universe.',\n"," 'High angular resolution molecular and dust images of Supernova 1987A. Supernova (SN) 1987A is a unique SN, which modern telescopes can spatially resolve at wavelengths ranging from X-ray to radio. Its time evolution has been monitored over 30 years, revealing how a SN has transformed into a SN remnant in remarkable detail. For the cycle 6 program, we request deep high-angular resolution images of SN 1987A in bands 6, 7 & 9, covering SiO 6-5, SiO 7-6, CO 6-5 and dust 450-micron and 850-micron emission. The combination of these images will give temperature and column density maps of dust and SiO. Furthermore, SiO data provide the 3-dimensional velocity map of this molecule. With these images, we will investigate four science cases. (1) probing potential on-going interaction between ejecta dust and reverse shocks, (2) tracing the past dust formation and investigating chemistry operating in the SN ejecta (3) identifying the neutron star and (4) investigating the proper motion of clumps in the ejecta and its cooling.',\n"," 'From Hydrocarbons to Dust in Protoplanetary Nebulae. We propose to observe two carbon-rich protoplanetary nebulae (PPNe), CRL 618 and CRL 2688, to investigate the physical and chemical conditions that lead to complex hydrocarbon chemistry in the circumstellar environment of evolved stars after the AGB phase. Polyacetylenes and cyanopolyynes have been detected with ISO in both sources. However benzene, the first aromatic ring, is only seen in CRL 618. Only CRL 2688 shows emission from dust grains rich in aliphatics. For both molecules and grains, UV-processing was invoked as a key process in driving the chemical evolution. We want to explore the emission of vibrationally excited HCCCN in both sources, CCH, HCN, CN and CO to constraint the physical and chemical conditions. In addition towards CRL 618, HCO+ and a recombination line of Hydrogen will be observed to better characterize the photodissociation region (PDR) at the interface between the HII region and the torus. Only ALMA can addressed this project since PPNe have complex morphologies and the most active chemistry is expected to occur in the densest part at scales of 0.2 to ~1\". We will obtain unique data to investigate carbonaceous grain formation and evolution.',\n"," 'The puzzling JWST object timely distangled by ALMA: Dusty starburst at z~5 or Ultra high-z galaxy at z~17?. JWST has sparked a revolution of effort to discover and study galaxies at very early cosmic epochs. In particular, remarkably bright z~17 galaxy candidates are identified from several teams, which, if real, defies every early galaxy evolution model that assumes Lambda CDM cosmology. However, the latest study reports a tentative SCUBA2 850um detection from one of these candidates and shows that a z~5 dusty starburst galaxy with strong nebular emission lines can make its JWST/NIRCam broadband photometry at 1-5um resemble the extreme high-z galaxy SED. Here we propose a timely 1-hr ALMA Band 7 follow-up via DDT for such a z~17 galaxy candidate to confirm/rule out the lower-z scenario. Rather than waiting for the regular call, validating the robustness of first galaxy candidates at the farthest frontier is of urgent importance to the community in designing the next generation of follow-up observations, including ALMA cycle10 in April 2023 and JWST cycle2 in January 2023. Given this aspect, we waive the proprietary period of this DDT program.',\n"," 'Active geology on Europa: hot spots, plumes, and surface anomalies. Our Cycle 3 observations of Europa revealed the presence of multiple regions on the satellite elevated in temperature by more than 10 degrees above that expected. Such hot spots could be regions where liquid water has intruded within hundreds of meters of the surface. Indeed, one such previously suspected hot spot, revealed in very limited Galileo spacecraft nightside thermal data, is coincident with the location of a recently suggested recurring plume on Europa. Hot spots could be regions of currently active geology and windows into the interior ocean. Unfortunately, our Cycle 3 observations cannot determine if these hot spots are caused by internal heating, by localized anomalies in thermal inertia, or by unusual surface properties. Measuring the temperatures of these regions as they move from morning to noon to afternoon easily resolves these degeneracies as different types of hot spots have very different temperature histories. We propose to obtain Europa thermal maps every 30 degrees of rotation to allow us to discover and map true hot spots on Europa for the first time. Such spots will be clear and exciting targets for future observation and exploration.',\n"," 'Directly linking gas and ice abundances in low-mass protostars. The main scientific goal of this proposal is to test observationally whether complex molecules detected in the gas phase originally have been formed by solid-state processes in icy grain mantles, as assumed in most interstellar chemistry models. Comparison of abundance ratios of these molecules obtained with ALMA in hot cores and envelopes with those derived from ice spectra to be obtained with JWST-MIRI GTO data for the same sources offers for the first time the opportunity to actively bridge the gas-grain gap.',\n"," 'Measuring dust segregation across the rings of HD163296. Thanks to ALMA we are discovering a variety of small scale structures in an incresing number of protoplanetary disks, that were previously thought to have a smooth distribution of dust surface density. The exceptional brightness of the HD163296 system allowed us to observe both the dust and gas emission at a ~0.2arcsec resolution, revealing a three bright rings at 1.3mm wavelength, and a CO depletion compatible with the presence of neptune-like planets (Isella et al. 2016). Recently acquired observations at 3mm are showing us hints of differential dust segregation across the dust structures, but the current resolution is not sufficient for separating the spectral index measurements inside and outside such structures, and optical depth effects at 1mm do not allow us to trace the true surface density in the inner regions of the disk (<50 AU). We ask for Band 4 and Band 3 observations at a matched resolution in order to resolve the spectral index (and therefore the maximum grain size) across the rings seen at 1.3mm, and attenuate the optical depth effects in the inner disk.',\n"," 'Measuring the Size of a New Dwarf Planet Candidate. We seek to accurately measure the size of a new dwarf planet candidate discovered by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The object is currently the second most distant known TNO at 92.5 AU with an r-band magnitude of 23.2, suggesting that its diameter may be >1000 km. An object of this size would be comparable to the largest main belt asteroid, Ceres, or Plutos moon Charon. Optical measurements alone cannot determine the candidates size because its albedo is unknown. TNOs are known to exhibit a wide range of albedos, from a dark, organic-rich 5% to icy 80% or more, meaning our candidate may range in size from 350-1200km. We propose to use ALMA to study the thermal emission of our candidate to obtain a more accurate size measurement and potentially establish it among the five largest known minor bodies in the solar system. This object, if found to have a low albedo and large diameter, would signal a larger population of 1000-km-class TNOs. Measurement of its size will also enable a calculation of its albedo/composition. Six hours of integration time will result in a robust detection of our dwarf planet candidate for even our smallest size estimate.',\n"," 'Measuring the Most Energetic Event in the Universe. Galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally-bound objects in the Universe and, according to the hierarchical picture of structure formation, are the most recent to form. A crucial aspect of their formation is through mergers, which violently dissipate most of their kinetic energy in shocks. The merger in 1E0657-56 -- a.k.a. \"the Bullet Cluster\" -- is one of the cleanest astrophysical labs for shock physics and may be the single most energetic event in the visible Universe since the Big Bang itself. The Bullet Cluster provides direct evidence that clusters are dominated by cold dark matter through the large spatial s eparations between the gas and lensing peaks. We propose to use ALMA+ACA Band 3 observations to provide the first sensitive (~7.6 uJy/bm), high-resolution (<8\") Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect measurement of the shock front in the Bullet Cluster. We will jointly model the ALMA measurements of the shock with deep X-ray data from the Chandra and NuSTAR X-ray telescopes, and compare these measurements to existing arcminute-resolution measurements to place more direct constraints on the shock energetics and better infer the line of sight distribution of the gas.',\n"," 'Phosphorus-bearing molecules towards a Solar-system precursor. The study of the chemical composition of planet-forming regions is a fundamental step to understand how prebiotic chemistry could proceed in the early Earth. Phosphorus compounds, and in particular the P-O chemical bond, play a key role in the formation large biomolecules such as DNA. We have recently detected PO for the first time towards massive star-forming regions, but the detection towards a Solar-system precursor at protoplanetary disk scales (< 100 au) is still lacking. This project proposes to detect PO (and also PN) towards the Solar-like protostellar system IRAS16293-2422 at high spatial resolution (0.35 au). This will allow us to disentangle if the P-bearing emission previously detected with a single-dish telescope arises from the centrifugal barrier (~50 au), the surrounding envelope (50-200 au) or from more extended gas associated molecular outflows (>200 au). This will put important constraints about the formation of P-bearing molecules. The molecular abundances of PO and PN will be compared with those we have recently derived in the comet 67P to investigate if there is a Phosphorus chemical thread.',\n"," 'From Dark to Light: Star Clusters in Formation. We propose to study the disk and envelope properties of YSOs in the dense star forming environments of Serpens Main and Serpens South -two young clusters, one with an age of 100,000-200,000 years and the other around 2 million years. We will survey 51 known and suspected YSOs in Serpens Main and 44 in Serpens South with 0.6\" resolution in the continuum at 220 GHZ and the DCO+ J=3-2 line. We have chosen a combination of resolution and spatial frequency coverage which will allow us to measure the disk mass (inside 250 AU) and envelope mass (inside 4000 AU) in these sources. Even with 2 minute integrations per source, we can improve on previous studies of these regions by nearly a factor of 100 in mass sensitivity and a factor of 9 in resolution. The results will reveal how much circumstellar mass and its distribution varies with age and YSO luminosity. The requested observations are deep enough that we hope to detect circumstellar mass associated with significantly sub-solar luminosity objects, allowing identifications of new YSOs in the cluster.',\n"," 'Surveying the diversity of asteroid surfaces. The main asteroid belt population shows a remarkable diversity in composition and surface properties, which reflects the formation locations and subsequent collisional and dynamical evolution of these objects, as well as the space weathering of their surfaces. ALMA enables high spatial resolution measurements of asteroid thermal emission and polarization, providing a powerful new tool for asteroid surface characterization. The only three objects observed with this technique to date lie at the highly-processed and metal-rich end of the compositional spectrum. We propose to broaden the sample of objects observed with this technique by observing ten new targets over a range of spectral classes to understand how surface composition and thermophysical properties correlate with spectral type, and strengthen the link between asteroid spectral classes and their formation and evolutionary pathways.',\n"," 'Excitation conditions of the diffuse gas traced by [CI] in main sequence galaxies at z~1.2. Atomic carbon CI has been proposed as a tracer of cold gas in galaxies in alternative to dust and CO. To date, only lensed SMGs and QSOs are [CI]-detected at high z, completely missing the bulk of the normal main-sequence (MS) population. Thus, we started an ALMA survey to detect [CI](1-0) in MS galaxies at z=1.2, partially covered in CO(2-1) and CO(5-4). First results confirm that [CI](1-0) is an excellent gas tracer and that MS galaxies are offset from starbursts (SB) in the IR vs [CI](1-0) luminosity plane, while being 4x less CI rich. We now aim to study the excitation conditions of the gas traced by CI observing the [CI](2-1) transition. In 11.5 hours of Band 7, we will (1) derive the excitation temperature Texc~[CI](2-1)/[CI](1-0) for 7 sources with [CI](1-0) and dust continuum detection from our survey; (2) study systematic differences among gas conditions in MS galaxies and SMGs/QSOs/SBs; (3) evaluate the dust temperature as a proxy for Texc, a common assumption with limited empirical support; (4) finalize a comprehensive analysis in a sample of well studied MS galaxies by comparing [CI](1-0), [CI](2-1), CO(2-1), CO(5-4), and CO(7-6) (obtained while observing [CI](2-1)).',\n"," 'Probing into the Deep: Characterizing Substructure in Disks Around the Youngest Protostars. A hallmark of gravitationally unstable disks is their spiral structure and fragmentation due to self-gravity. Despite the progress and robustness of gravitational instability theory and simulations, observations of gravitationally unstable disks, traced by dust continuum emission in the disk midplanes, have thus far remained elusive. We have identified three protostellar systems with VLA-detected companions at ~20AU separations that are surrounded by >0.1 M_sun circumbinary structures. Given that the companion sources likely formed within these disks, we propose 3mm continuum observations at 0.078\" (18 AU) resolution (same as the VLA resolution) to characterize the structure of the circumbinary disks and resolve the companion sources with ALMA. The proposed ALMA observations will be able to map the VLA-detected dust emission with a factor of ~6.6x higher S/N due to brighter dust emission at 3mm, enabling us to characterize substructure in the circumbinary disks, which could not be done with the VLA data. Thus, the proposed observations have the potential to reveal new details in the process of binary star formation and structure of gravitationally unstable disks.',\n"," 'Physics of the interstellar medium of galaxies in the reionization era: the [OIII]-to-[CII] line ratio II.

Studies of rare z > 4 dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) are important for understanding the physical drivers of extreme star formation, mass assembly and growth, and their evolutionary connections with other populations. The largest Herschel surveys, HerMES and H-ATLAS, have selected a large number of DSFGs. Selecting those with ultrared colors in SPIRE bands (500um-risers: S500 > S350 > S250) is extremely efficient for identifying DSFGs at z > 4. We are carrying out a multi-wavelength observational campaign aimed at characterizing their gas, dust, and stellar properties. The most urgently missing information are their spectroscopic redshifts. We propose ALMA 3mm spectral scans of 38 Herschel ultrared DSFGs to obtain robust spectroscopic redshifts, via the detection of multiple molecular and/or atomic lines. This will be a complete redshift survey of DSFGs at z > 4 down to the 500um-riser selection thresholds. All the targets in this sample have existing multi-wavelength data including Spitzer/IRAC, and are just awaiting spectroscopic redshifts, in order to to fully characterize this population, and determine the space density, SFR density, and stellar mass density at z > 4.',\n"," 'Control of Star Formation in Massive Filamentary Clouds: Orion. The Herschel mission has revealed omnipresent filamentary structures in molecular clouds. Such structures possibly govern the entire star formation process in the interstellar medium. In this picture, high-mass stars and star-clusters form preferentially in massive filaments whose properties differ from those of low-mass ones, demonstrating a strong environmental dependence. What is crucially missing is the knowledge of how massive filaments fragment and collapse to form stars. With ALMA, we will fill this knowledge gap by describing the fragmentation of the most nearby massive filament, the Orion filament, in great detail. We will observe the filament in 110 GHz continuum and C18O line emission. These data, together with our Herschel and LABOCA data, will provide the highest-fidelity column density data ever obtained for a molecular cloud, from several-parsec scales to 1700 AU scales. We will determine the fragmentation mode of the filament with our novel techniques that recover both the volume density and kinematic structure. We will then connect this analysis with our protostellar census, establishing how filament fragmentation connects to the protostars within.',\n"," 'Resolving the duality of star-formation relations in LIRGs. We propose to map the emission of a set of dense molecular gas tracers (HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0) and CS(2-1)) in six local LIRGs using the unique spatial resolution (0.2\"~65 pc) and sensitivity of ALMA. This project builds on improving our knowledge of the formation and evolution of galaxies from the study of the star formation relations. The use of specific molecular gas tracers can probe the influence of the dynamical environment in the star formation process. Just recently, several works found that the star formation occurs in certain regions within galaxies, more specifically, some local LIRGs show a dual behaviour in the star formation relations. This duality shows two different dynamical environments depending on the distance relative to the centre of the galaxy. This project focuses on characterising the mechanisms involved in the dual and non-dual behaviour of local LIRGs found in the star formation relations and gives us information about the influence of the dynamical environment at forming stars. This work also helps to improve the star fomation models.',\n"," 'Unveiling the role of filamentary structures in star formation toward the mini-starburst region NGC6334. The NGC6334 molecular complex is one of the nearest mini-starburst star formation regions, i.e., a miniature model of starburst galaxies. Using recent ACA band 3 observations of NGC6334, 25 filaments in the position-position-velocity space are revealed. These filaments show longitudinal velocity gradients, gas infall signatures, narrow-line SiO emission, and oscillating velocity and intensity. Unfortunately, the poor angular resolution (18\"x10\") and sensitivity (1sigma mass ~10Msun) prevents from studying filaments and embedded cores in detail. Therefore, we propose this follow-up ALMA program with a higher angular resolution (3\") and sensitivity (1sigma mass ~0.13 Msun), in order to: 1) spatially and spectrally resolve filaments and embedded dense cores, 2) characterize the gas kinematics from ~1 pc filament scale down to ~0.02 pc core scale, and 3) examine the feasibility of using the SiO emission to trace the fossil record of the filament formation. This program will provide an unprecedented view of the global dynamical picture of the filament-based mini-starburst in NGC6334, which promises to unveil how the filament network promotes star formation in mini-starburst regions.',\n"," 'Circumnuclear Holes around Supermassive Black Holes. Galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are likely co-evolving, and the most accepted paradigm is an evolutionary process that involves self-regulating feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent high-resolution observations of nearby galaxies are revealing ~10-100 pc CO holes at their circumnuclear regions in 20 % of the galaxy, independent of their current nuclear activity. The origin of these circumnuclear holes are unknown, but their radii typically corresponds to the SMBH potential, suggesting that the SMBHs are the cause. If these holes are developed without powerful AGN, the SMBHs must be creating these holes through heating or dynamical effects. This suggests secular effects can impede accretion of gas, making it harder for AGN accretion to occur. To unravel the cause of these circumnuclear holes, we propose to observe the HCN(1-0), CO(1-0) and CO(6-5) lines in three galaxies with known CO(2-1) holes, to probe the presence of gas and analyse the physical state of the SMBH surroundings. The results will help to clarify the origin of circumnuclear holes, and thus will reveal direct evidence of their feedback even without a luminous AGN.',\n"," 'Probing the Gas Excitation in high redshift Main Sequence Galaxies. Recent CO observations in normal main-sequence galaxies at high redshift have shown that their star formation efficiency is lower than in case of merger driven SMGs, more consistent with the star formation efficiency in local spiral galaxies. The picture that emerges from this studies is that SMGs form stars more rapidly because their gas clouds are more compressed so they churn more quickly through the available gas reservoir than the typical normal high-z disk galaxies. These differences in the physical conditions of the ISM are expected to affect the CO and CI line ratios. Indeed earlier studies of low-J CO transitions suggest that main sequence galaxies have similar ISM properties than the MW. A coherent picture of the gas excitation in these systems, however, is missing so far. We here aim to investigate the gas excitation in three main-sequence galaxies selected from the PHIBSS survey. We propose to study the shape of the CO SED in conjunction with both lines of atomic carbon to investigate the physical conditions of their ISM. Our study aims to provide for the first time well characterized templates of the gas excitation in high redshift main-sequence galaxies.',\n"," 'Observing in real time the onset of outflow collimation in a massive protostar. Over 20 yr we have seen in “real time” that the expanding H2O maser shell found around the radio continuum emission of the massive protostar W75N VLA2, as well as the continuum source itself have evolved from an almost isotropic outflow into a jet (phenomenon not seen before in any protostar). We interpret this unique behavior in terms of an episodic, short-lived (tens of years), originally isotropic ionized wind whose morphology evolves as it moves within a toroidal density stratification. Through ALMA Band 6 continuum observations we will test this scenario by detecting the expected dust torus around VLA2. In addition, through molecular line observations we also expect to find collimated outflows associated with VLA2 and VLA1 (a radio jet separated from VLA 2 by 0.7”), parallel to each other and to the magnetic field orientation we found in the region. If such a parallel orientation of the outflows is observed, this would strongly indicate that the magnetic field plays a key role in the ejection and evolution of the outflows of these massive protostars. This opens a new, exciting window of opportunity to study how basic ingredients of massive star formation evolve in “real time\".',\n"," 'A mm snapshot survey of nearby young stars observed in scattered light. In the past years ALMA and scattered light observations have revealed a zoo of planet forming disk morphologies. Of particular value is the synergy between the two techniques, tracing different dust populations and vertical extends of the disk. While scattered light observations trace small dust particles, well coupled to the gas on the disk surface, mm-emission trace the bulk-mass of material close to the disk mid-plane. Recent studies of small scattered light surveys have found that there is a correlation between the dust-mass of the disk and the present sub-structures, with more massive disks typically showing gaps or cavities in scattered light. Such findings are still tentative due to small sample sizes of scattered light surveys, for which accompanying mm continuum data exists. In this program we propose to obtain low-spatial resolution ALMA Band 6 flux measurements of a unique sample of disks, which is currently targeted by scattered light surveys. All 29 targets stars in this sample show strong near or mid-infrared excess and have in some cases already been resolved in scattered light. The proposed flux measurements will critically allow us to constrain their dust masses.',\n"," 'More than LESS: The first fully-identified submillimetre survey. Ultraluminous infrared galaxies, specifically submillimetre-selected galaxies - SMGs, are a significant class of star-forming galaxies at z>1. There are a few thousand SMGs known, but no sample has the complete, secure identifications needed to derive their basic properties. We propose compact Band 7 continuum observations to precisely locate the submillimetre-emitting components in a complete sample of 126 SMGs selected from the recent LABOCA survey of the ECDFS. These observations will pin-point the submillimetre-luminous components within these sources, without recourse to statistical associations using radio/mid-/far-infrared counterparts. ALMA will thus address two key shortcomings of current submillimetre surveys: (1) Source blending - many SMGs are expected to be blended at the resolution of their discover maps. To determine the true form of the submillimetre counts - a key observable constraint of theoretical galaxy formation models - we need ALMA-resolution maps of a large sample of SMGs. (2) Incomplete identifications - the radio/mid-/far-infrared data miss the most distant (and coolest) SMGs due to their K-corrections, this biases the derived redshift distribution. ALMA will identify all the SMG counterparts in the same band they were selected in, irrespective of their redshift/spectral properties, testing the validity of the radio/mid-/far-infrared identifications (when present) and uncovering the high-redshift tail of SMGs. The improved resolution of the ALMA maps will also show the relation between obscured starburst and unobscured stellar mass and AGN activity within these systems. These 5.4-hrs of observations will provide revolutionary science - addressing fundamental questions about the nature of SMGs - in a way which was impossible before ALMA.',\n"," 'The Evolution of Disks Around Low-mass Stars. The lifetime of primordial, optically thick disks around young stars places empirical constraints on the timescale to form planetary systems. Submillimeter observations play a critical role in quantifying the evolution since the emission is optically thin over most of the disk and probes the cool material where most of the disk mass resides and where most planets form. We request time with ALMA to image the dust and gas toward a complete sample of disks around stars in the 5-11 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB Association that have spectral types between M4.75 and G0, corresponding to stellar masses between about 0.2 and 2 Msun. Upper Sco is the nearest OB association of this age, and thereby provides an opportunity to obtain sensitive measurements of the disk properties at the end stage in the lifetime of primordial disks. By comparing the dust emission from disks in Upper Sco with existing continuum observations of 1 Myr stars in Taurus, we aim to measure 1) the amount of dust that is dispersed from disks on 5-10 Myr timescales, 2) the efficiency of disk dispersal as a function of stellar mass, and 3) how the dust mass evolves between evolutionary states.',\n"," 'Direct measurement of planet-forming gas mass using line pressure broadening. The gas mass in the main planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks is one of the most important parameters for understanding planet formation processes. However, measuring the gas mass has been challenging due to the lack of an H2 gas tracer. The recent discovery of the pressure broadened CO line wings has allowed the first direct and accurate measurement of the gas mass in a protoplanetary disk. Based on this groundbreaking discovery, we propose deep observations of the 12CO 3-2 line in four protoplanetary disks to detect the pressure-broadened line wings, as well as the 13C18O line to measure the CO column density. By combining these observations, we will determine the H2 gas mass in the main planet-forming regions and robustly assess their planet formation potential for the first time. The proposed observations will revolutionize the measurement of planet-forming gas mass.',\n"," 'Characterizing the physical conditions of star-forming ISM at z=6. Recent near-infrared spectroscopy studies of massive quiescent galaxies at z=4 suggest that they were formed by z>5 with a strong and short burst of star formation. Submillimeter bright galaxies (SMGs) at z=6 are the most likely progenitors of massive quiescent galaxies at z=4. This proposal requests 6 hours of ALMA time to characterize the physical conditions of the star-forming interstellar medium (ISM) in an extreme starburst galaxy at the reionization epoch. We aim to observe the [CII] 158um, [OI] 145 um, and [NII] 122 um far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines. Combining the measurement of the line fluxes with that of [OIII] 88 um and [NII] 205 um in ALMA archival data, we will be able to derive the physical properties of both ionized and PDR gas in the SMG at z=6: 1) gas density in ionized regions, 2) gas density in PDRs, 3) PDR fraction of [CII] emission, 4) ionized/PDR volume filling factor, 5) gas-phase metallicity, 6) strength of radiation field from the line ratios, and 7) dust temperature from dust continuum SEDs.',\n"," '[NII] 205 um at z~3-5.7. We propose to observe the [NII]205 micron transition in 16 dusty star forming galaxies previously detected in low or mid-J CO and the [CII]158 micron line and distributed at redshifts z~3-5.7. The [NII]205 line is a sensitive tracer of ionized gas, and complements the [CII] line as a star formation diagnostic. We will use the [NII] line to measure the ionized gas mass, characterize the ionizing source (as O stars or B stars), and we will use the [NII]/[CII] ratio to determine how much of the measured [CII] arises from ionized rather than neutral gas - a crucial parameter for interpreting current and future [CII] surveys. Our observations will dramatically increase the number of [NII] detections at high redshift. This project complements the work of our (ongoing) A-ranked, cycle 3 project to characterize [NII] in z~1-2 galaxies. This addition to our [NII] campaign allows a unique look at star formation, tracing trends in [NII] throughout the epochs of peak star formation and galaxy assembly.',\n"," 'The Precessing Molecular Jet in the NGC1377 Nucleus: Outburst from an Accreting SMBH. We propose high resolution (0.\"04= 4 pc) Band 7 ALMA observations of the center of the unusual S0 galaxy NGC1377. With ALMA we discovered a highly collimated molecular outflow in NGC1377 with velocity reversals that we attribute to a precessing molecular jet. The presence of the jet signals an unexplored and transient phase in the feeding of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our goal is to resolve the jet near the enshrouded nucleus and search for a hot circumnuclear torus. By mapping in the CO-3-2 and vibrationally excited HCN emission we will trace different physical conditions allowing us to probe separate components of the nucleus. We aim to (1) determine if the jet is powered by hot or cold accretion and if it is currently destroying its torus, and (2) investigate if the apparent precession is caused by a misaligned accretion flow or by a binary SMBH. This evolutionary phase should be extremely short-lived, which can explain other features of NGC1377, including its extraordinarily weak radio emission (far below the FIR-radio correlation). NGC1377 is nearby and offers a prime opportunity to study the interplay between SMBH growth and feedback in unprecedented detail.',\n"," 'Monitoring radio emission of the youngest planetary system with ALMA. Millimeter or submm emission has never been detected from exoplanets or their hosts up to date. The recently discovered hot Jupiter V830 Tau b orbiting a weak-line TT star with a strong magnetic field is a promising system for a first detection in submm wavelength. The system has been detected twice in centimeter by VLA and VLBA among 5 observations, and thus the system is highly variable in radio emission. It is unclear why it varies, and whether it emits from the star, the planet or an interaction between them. We propose to observe the system 5 times in Band 3 with uneven intervals in about 20 days, and a single observation in Band 6 with ALMA, both aiming to reach a sensivitiy of 18uJy. The detection or the non-detection will firstly give us crucial constrainst on the origin of radio emission, and will help to understand the varibility of radio emissions. A first detection of mm-wavelength emission will open a new window for the study of exoplanets, and provide important information about magnetic fields, and therefore planets interior structure, habitability and atmospheric retention.',\n"," 'The host properties and environment of high-redshift radio galaxies with ACA. It is now accepted that radio-emitting jets might be one of the main ingredients shaping the evolution of massive galaxies in the Universe. There is wide observational evidence that the super-massive black holes responsible for such jets reside in the most massive galaxy population, which in turn reside in large scale structures. This trend seems to have settled long time ago, making radio-AGN a natural lighthouse of such structures in the early Universe. However, pinpointing these early radio-AGN and studying their hosts has been harder to accomplish, with only recent reasonable numbers of radio-AGN host studies coming to light at z>2. This proposal aims to provide a statistical understanding of radio-AGN found within 4deg2 in the ELAIS-S1 field known to have the lowest foreground contamination, hence ideal for mid-IR observations with JWST. We propose to observe 41 high-redshift radio-AGN (selected either via their ultra-steep radio spectrum or extreme IR-to-radio flux ratios) at 1.3mm with ACA down to rms=0.2mJy. The ACA field of view will in addition allow us to assess the star-formation activity in the local environment of these galaxies (within a radius of ~180kpc at z~2).',\n"," 'Completing the SPT+ALMA Redshift Survey. Recent ground and space-based multi wavelength (sub)millimeter surveys have discovered a large number of strongly lensed, ultra-bright sub-mm galaxies (SMGs). From these surveys, particularly the 2500 square degree South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, we have constructed a catalog of these 81 high-redshift SMGs. Blind scans using ALMAs 3mm line capabilities have proven useful for determining spectroscopic redshifts. Previous ALMA proposals have enabled us to determine the spectroscopic redshifts for 76 of these sources using ALMAs 3mm line scans. In this proposal, we present the last 13 sources for which we only detect a single line feature. In these cases, we can only narrow the line identification to two plausible CO transitions, which leads to ambiguity in our results. We therefore request an additional 7.42 hours of observing time in order detect a second CO line in band 4, which would confirm their redshift. Obtaining robust redshifts for the complete catalog of SPT sources will enable further study into star formation rate for this highly elusive population of galaxies, and further our understanding of galaxy evolution.',\n"," 'CO spectral scanning of z>6.5 QSO candidates selected from PanSTARRS. We propose ALMA spectroscopy of 23 QSO candidates at z>6.5 selected from the new PanSTARRS1 3pi survey. Our goal is to build a statistical sample of z> 6.5 QSOs, which is crucial for understanding of the reionization epoch and growth of the supermassive black holes in the early Universe. All targets are clear z-band dropouts (detectable only in the y band) with faint/no detection in WISE. This makes them very promising high-redshift QSO candidates. We propose a new and more efficient spectroscopic survey, by spectral scanning CO(6-5) emission in ALMA Band 3. The redshifted CO(6-5) line is between 84 and 92 GHz. Therefore, we only need two tunings to scan the CO line at 6.5',\n"," 'Small-Scale Clustering of CO emitters around Quasars at z~4. Luminous quasars (QSOs) at z~4 are the most strongly clustered population known at this epoch, and should thus reside in massive dark matter halos surrounded by large overdensities of galaxies. In order to quantify overdensities of optical galaxies around QSOs, we recently conducted a survey for Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the environs of 17 QSOs at z~4 and measured the QSO-LAE cross-correlation function. We detected an LAE overdensity of 1.4 in QSO fields and found that LAEs are significantly clustered around the QSO. However, our measurements fall short of the predicted overdensities by a factor of 2.1. This discrepancy could be explained by the presence of excess dust in galaxies near QSOs, which make them invisible in the optical. Here we propose to use ALMA to explore this possibility and quantify the overdensities of CO(4-3) emitters in the environments of our 17 QSOs, by measuring the QSO-CO emitter cross-correlation function at small (< 1 Mpc) scales. The proposed dataset represents the final piece to clearly characterize high-z QSO environments, ultimately allowing us to trace simultaneously the clustering of both optical and dusty galaxy populations around QSOs.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas in Local Merging ULIRGs. Hierarchical galaxy formation scenario predicts that galaxy-galaxy interaction and merger are the fundamental process that are related to the evolution of galaxies in the universe, changing the galaxy morphology and triggering intense starbursts and/or AGN activity. Recent high resolution simulations have shown that tidal interaction is responsible for forming massive clumps of dense gas surrounded by diffuse gas clouds and triggering star formation across the galaxy disks. An observational test of gas response requires mapping both the diffuse and dense gas tracers in merging U/LIRGs at high spatial resolution. Here we propose a systematic CO(1-0), CO(3-2), HCN(4-3), HCO+(4-3) survey of 6 of the brightest merging ULIRGs in the local universe at 0.3 arcsec (200 pc) resolution of ALMA. The primary aim of this study is to map the distribution and kinematics of warm/dense molecular gas and the dense gas mass fraction and interpret their relation to star formation and AGN activities in the context of the merger-induced response of the ISM in the progenitor disks.',\n"," 'Quantifying gas inside dust cavities in transitional disks: mass, distribution and composition. Transitional disks with large inner dust cavities are thought to be the best laboratories for studying disk evolution during the planet-forming stage. Little is known about the gas inside dust cavities, yet this gas significantly affects planet formation through gas-grain dynamics and planetary migration whereas its chemistry controls the composition of gas-giant atmospheres. We propose here pioneering ALMA Band 7 observations of 13CO, C18O and CN 3-2 lines and the millimeter continuum to provide deep searches for molecular gas inside the dust cavities. The three proposed sources are part of only a handful of transitional disks with known CO IR emission and large enough dust cavities to be studied in Cycle 1. They span a range of spectral types and other disk parameters, allowing similarities and differences among the small sample to be studied. The huge leap in sensitivity provided by ALMA, in combination with new thermo-chemical models to interpret the data, allows a large range of gas masses inside the hole to be tested, down to about an Earth mass. This, in turn, allows the origin of the cavity in this disk to be determined: substellar or (multi-)planetary mass companions versus grain growth or photoevaporation. The CN/CO ratio provides initial insight into the chemical composition of the gas and its variations within and outside the cavity.',\n"," 'Accretion and Feedback of a Very Massive Protostar. Forming massive stars become so luminous that their ionizing feedback may stop the accretion and limit their further growth. In order to investigate the accretion and feedback processes in the formation of very massive stars, we propose ALMA Band 7 highest resolution observations of continuum and hydrogen recombination lines toward the massive young stellar object G45.47+0.05. Previous Band 6 observations reveal an hourglass-shape bipolar photoevaporative outflow in this source, which may also drive a strong jet with nonthermal emissions embedded inside the ionized outflow, suggesting on-going accretion. Here we aim to probe the dust component surrounding the ionized outflow and inner ionized disk to investigate the impact of the photoionization feedback on the accretion disk and surrounding material. We also aim to use hydrogen recombination lines to study the kinematics of the ionized gas, especially disk rotation and the outflow motions to test the disk accretion scenario and evaluate the strength of feedback. These observations will put strong constraints on how feedback and accretion processes interact with each other around a forming star of at least 40 solar masses.',\n"," 'Determination of the TW Hya Disk Mass. The main constituent of protoplanetary disks, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not emit from the disk mass reservoir and the most common technique to measure the disk gas mass in extra-solar systems is via dust thermal emission. However, this method generally assumes that we know how the grain properties and the gas-to-dust mass ratio evolve from their interstellar medium values which is highly model dependent and poorly constrained by actual observations. Thus even in TW Hya, the closest template object, there is a large discrepancy in the total disk mass. We propose here to use ALMA, combined with unique Herschel data, to determine the total disk gas mass in the TW Hya disk. Recently, using Herschel, we detected the ground-state transition of HD, an excellent probe of H2 gas, and therefore mass. This transition is however sensitive to the disk gas temperature structure deeper inside the disk than probed by CO. We request observations of 13CO (with C18O) J = 6 - 5 and J = 3 - 2 at an angular resolution of 0.5\", thereby resolving the region where 25 - 60% of the HD emission is predicted to arise. The ALMA and Herschel data will be used in tandem to to empirically determine the gas excitation deep in the TW Hya disk and its gas mass.This is a fundamental estimate of the primary quantity that controls planet formation.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas content of a ULIRG at z>7. While we have made great progress characterizing galaxy growth over the first billion years of the Universe, there is still a fundamental gap in our understanding. Stellar mass content studies as well as star formation rate estimates both coincide in showing that early galaxies grew very rapidly, but what sustains this growth? Are high-z galaxies particularly efficient at forming stars or do they have particularly large molecular gas reservoirs fueling their growth? Answering this question requires studying the molecular gas content of galaxies, and at z>7, high-J CO lines are our best bet. Recent samples of bright [CII] detected galaxies have opened the door to such studies but they still remain very challenging due to how faint CO lines are expected to be. Here we propose a first study of the molecular content of a galaxy at z>7 through the CO(7-6) line. Our source is a ULIRG, bright in [CII], with enhanced metallicity, and dust content (compared to galaxies at similar redshift). This combination implies a higher CO content, and dust shielding that prevents CO photodissociation. This is one of the best sources for a first study of the molecular gas content in a galaxy at z>7.',\n"," 'Trace the molecular gas reservoir in ULIRGs with co-existing extreme ionized outflows and vigorous starbursts. Ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) are thought to represent the rapidly growing phase of massive galaxies before quenching of their star formation by powerful AGN-driven outflows. In order to examine the statistical AGN and outflow properties of ULIRGs, we have constructed an AKARI 90 um flux limited complete catalog of 1028 ULIRGs at z=0.1-1.0. Five ULIRGs in the sample show extremely fast outflows (v > 1500 km/s), which are the most powerful outflows observed among ULIRGs and AGNs at z<1. However, the star formation activities in the five ULIRGs are highly intense with SFR of 300-2000 Msun/yr, comparable to the SFR of high-z ULIRGs. The co-existence of the extremely strong outflows and the intense SF activities is conflicting with the classical AGN feedback scenario. One possibility is that although the AGN-driven wind is powerful, it has only affected the hot, ionized gas, but not affected the cold, molecular clouds in which star formation occurs. In order to reveal the physical explanation behind the co-existence of the strong outflows and SF activities in these ULIRGs, it is crucial to determine the status of molecular clouds with sub-millimeter observations.',\n"," 'Irradiated Shocks and Ionisation Sources in the Central Parsec of the Milky Way.

This component is beam diluted in our single-dish Herschel observations of the complete CO rotational ladder but can be inferred from the line profiles. Our observations using all 3 instruments on board Herschel have also revealed the presence of overabundant H2O and OH, as well as unexpected hot CO in the vicinity of SgrA*. We wish to understand the origin of this high velocity gas, and its heating and ionisation sources, using ALMA to search for the key missing information and to determine both the spatial structure and the ionization fraction using well established molecular tracers (HCO+, HOC+ and SO+).',\n"," 'Turbulent Structure around the Very Low-Mass Class 0 Protostar IRAS 15398-3359. A principal goal of this proposal is to reveal the velocity structure and the angular momentum distribution of the protostellar core of the very young low-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS 15398-3359 and characterize its turbulent eddies/elements. In this source, two past outflows have recently been identified in addition to the on-going outflow, whose directions are largely different from one another. Such a dramatic reorientation of the outflow is most likely caused by episodic accretion events of the turbulent gas elements with different angular momentum axes. To examine such complex structures of the protostellar core, we observe the H13CO+ and CO isotopologue lines in Band 3 and analyze them by using two kinds of autocorrelation functions (ACFs), from which we derive the coherent size of the spectrum feature and that of the velocity gradient. They are used to evaluate the size scale of the co-rotating fluid elements in the core. This observation is a novel attempt to study the turbulent structure of protostellar cores and will largely develop our understanding of its importance in the earliest stage of star formation.',\n"," 'Tending the Fire: A Survey of Molecular Gas Fueling in Powerful Nearby AGN.

Dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at high redshift are thought to be dominantly highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies that represent extreme, short-lived starbursts.

Through a novel selection technique based on Herschel/SPIRE colors, we have identified a new sample of DSFGs at z=4.16-6.34. Using the new long baselines of ALMA, we propose to study the [CII] gas dynamics, OH and dust in 4 representative z=4.2-5.2 starbursts in our sample down to 500pc resolution. Based on dynamical models, we will investigate the occurence rate of major mergers vs. disks, measure dynamical masses, and constrain the physical properties of individual gas clumps down to physical scales not previously accessible outside the local universe. We will also search for faint, \"CO-dark\", perhaps low-metallicity companion galaxies within 100-150kpc of our massive, dusty starbursts.

Feedback processes have a profound influence on the physics of galaxy clusters, and are thought to be the main mechanism by which runaway cooling flows and star formation are suppressed in the cores of galaxy clusters.

We propose to observe 3 cool-core clusters which are superficially similar, but contain key discrepancies in the level of gas sloshing that likely persists after past, small-scale merger events. This rich dataset will be used to probe 1) the pressure profiles in the core (thought to obey a universal form in cool-core clusters), 2) turbulence and the SZ power spectrum, 3) offsets in the SZ peak, which would challenge the X-ray and simulation-based interpretation of sloshing in clusters, and 4) bubbles from AGN feedback.

We propose to image the debris disk of the ~nearby (30.1pc) >2.5Gyr-old sub-giant KIV star kCrB in band 6 to determine the disk structure at 1.5\" resolution, >7 times better than previous observations. This system hosts an Exo-Jupiter planet at 2.8au and a second massive planet (>2MJup) on a wide-orbit (a>15.8au), as well as dust disk. The proposed images will determine the architecture of the planetary belt and the radial distribution of material, which is likely being strongly influenced by the outer massive planet. Models are in place to interpret the observed structure in terms of unseen planets in the outer regions, their formation and evolution. Whilst no strong correlations have been found to exist between systems with Exo-Jupiters and those with debris belts, this has yet to be tested in detail for a system with a bright known dust belt with close-in and wide-orbit massive planets. The proximity, sub-mm brightness and mass of kCrB make it uniquely placed for studying planetary systems in the presence of multiple massive planets. Additionally, we will search for CO J=2-1 line emission within the disk, which if found would be the oldest CO Gas ever detected in a debris belt.',\n"," 'A Multicolor View of the Black Hole Environment in M87. Recent Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87 have revealed a ring-like structure near the event horizon at 230 GHz. This structure was interpreted as a photon ring surrounding a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and the photon capture at the event horizon. However, the origin of the ring needs to be better understood. Photons that are not entirely bound by black hole gravity, such as the emission from plasma located further away from the photon capture radius, may also contribute to the observed ring. The recent GMVA+ALMA observation of M87 in Cycle 5 at 86 GHz indicates that a ring-like structure may exist in the core of M87 at this frequency as well. Here we propose new GMVA+ALMA observations of M87 in Cycle 9, when EHT+ALMA observations at both 230 and 345 GHz are expected to be performed for the first time. These observations will provide a multicolor (3.5, 1.3, and 0.9 mm) view of the black hole environment in M87, allowing us to investigate the origin of the ring, the physical properties of plasma in the innermost accretion flows and jets, and the magnetic field structure and Faraday rotation of the ring.',\n"," 'The newly discovered G337.92 hot core: a chemical twin of Sagittarius B2(N)?. The star-forming region Sgr B2(N) is commonly seen as a key search site for new complex organic molecules (COMs). Recent analysis focusing on other star-forming regions with high degree of complexity in their chemical composition, arises questions: how widespread are these COMs? Is the molecular composition of Sgr B2(N) unique? Is there a unified view on the origin of COMs ? The recent discovery of the G337.92 hot core, which shows stricking similarities with Sgr B2(N), will allow a great step forward to address these questions. In chemically rich sources, the firm identification of (new) molecules often requires a detailed analysis of the emission lines of weakly-emitting complex molecules. We propose to use ALMA in Cycle 8 to perform a deep, unbiased imaging line survey of G337.92 at 3mm. The requested high sensitivity combined with the large frequency coverage, should allow the detection of several COMs already identified toward Sgr B2(N) but not yet in G337.92. Comparing observed abundance ratios will allow us to confirm (or not) the resemblance of the two sources and to constrain the chemical/physical processes that lead to this resemblance.',\n"," 'Tracing the Flow into Dense Cores in High-Mass Star Forming Filaments. High-mass star forming clouds often exhibit filamentary structures in which dense cores of ~<10 Msun are embedded. In order to form high-mass protostars, these dense cores must accrete gas from the environment. However direct evidence of accretion onto dense cores in filaments is rare. We have selected 8 massive filamentary clouds encompassing a variety of evolutionary phases, and obtained ALMA 12m array, VLA, and SMA data. Dense cores of ~<10 Msun are found in the filaments. Tentative signatures of accretion along (sub-)filaments and along the line of sight are found with ALMA 12m array data (using optically thick HCO+/HCN and optically thin H13CO+/NH2D lines), but missing flux (lack of short-spacing data) remains a major problem for quantitatively interpreting the accretion signatures. Here we propose to obtain the short-spacing data that are critical for solving the missing flux issue. Two critical questions will be quantitatively addressed: whether there is a correlation between accretion rates and core masses, and whether the ~<10 Msun cores will accrete enough mass to produce high-mass protostars.',\n"," 'The temperature-multiplicity relation with ALMA. Multiple protostellar systems are the most common form of star formation. Simulations suggest that heated gas hinders fragmentation, with only cold gas fragmenting. Once a protostar forms, the gas is quickly heated and further fragmentation is suppressed. Thus gas temperature has a direct impact on multiplicity. A recent survey of 12 Perseus embedded protostellar systems including single and multiple protostars, probed the cloud core gas temperature (~7000 AU) and found no correlation between gas temperature and multiplicity. However, the temperature structure can vary considerably on envelope scales (1000 AU). We therefore propose to observe the same sample of 12 embedded protostellar systems using the stand-alone ACA mode in Bands 6 and 7, targeting DCO+, H2CO and c-C3H2. These molecules trace cold, warm and UV-irradiated gas, respectively, and will produce gas temperature maps. We aim to determine if multiplicity is directly related to gas temperature on envelope scales, and its connection to the gas temperature on cloud core scales. We can determine whether the gas is warm (40K) or cold (<20K) at envelope scales, answering the relation of multiple star formation and temperature',\n"," 'What Stops Galactic Star Formation? An ALMA Study of Dense Molecular Gas in Post-Starburst Galaxies. We have identified a unique sample of post-starburst, post-merger galaxies, in transition between late- and early-types. Remarkably, we have discovered molecular gas in over half the sample, forcing these galaxies off the classical Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. In other words, they have significantly higher molecular gas surface densities than predicted by their star-formation rate (SFR) densities. Our cycle 3 ALMA observations have now constrained the CO (2-1) emission to be within only 1.5 kpc from the center in the post-starburst galaxies observed thus far. This discovery suggests a lower star formation efficiency than for normal star-forming galaxies with the same gas densities, making post-starburst galaxies a new laboratory for linking the physics of star formation on small scales to galaxy-wide trends. Only ALMA can measure the actual fuel for star formation, the denser gas traced by HCN, HCO+ and HNC, to determine what is preventing stars from forming. Here, we propose study the dense gas content of two post-starbursts with measured compact gas reservoirs.',\n"," 'Active Nuclei tori and outflows traced by CI. In recent years ALMA has revealed the presence of molecular tori of typical 10pc-scale radius in nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). These molecular tori are kinematically decoupled from their galaxy disk, and are often accompanied by molecular outflows, triggered by the AGN. The tori are clumpy and may be tilted, warped and turbulent. Both tori and outflows could produce the obscuration required in type 2 AGN, but currently it is impossible to disentangle them near the AGN. To increase the spatial resolution, and follow the AGN fueling/feedback further in, other tracers must be probed. The CO molecules are progressively destroyed to the benefit of atomic carbon CI, in the X-ray dominated region close to the AGN. We propose to map in CI at higher resolution (0.05=4, 2, 14 pc) than before the gas and dust emission in three nearby AGN, which have high X-ray luminosity. Our goal is to better trace the morphology and kinematics of the torus, quantify the fueling and feedback processes. We will determine the origin of molecular outflows, better traced in CI, and confront the observations to models. The higher resolution will also permit a more precise and accurate black hole mass.',\n"," 'Unveiling the Nature of the Hot Inner Disks around Accretion Outburst YSOs. Young stellar objects (YSOs) which are undergoing accretion outbursts may be surrounded by high-density hot inner disks (HID) on a few AU scales, which are required to feed protostellar accretion at a high rate. Only very high angular resolution observations at frequencies lower than 200 GHz can probe the dust emission of HID without being significantly confused by disk structures exterior to the HID. Physical properties of the rather obscured HID can be diagnosed with SED analysis at millimeter bands, analogous to the widely applied fitting of the infrared SED to diagnose the more extended dust structures around YSOs. However, presently only ALMA long baseline observations at Band 3 and Band 4 towards nearer than 500 pc sources can provide the adequate S/N within a realistic observing time. We propose to perform a comprehensive survey towards 16 selected nearby accretion outburst YSOs. Our main goals are to characterize the mass, size, and temperature of the HIDs. The proposed observations will be of paramount importance for the understanding of the accretion outburts of YSOs, and can provide important constraints on the innermost protoplanetary disk structures in general.',\n"," 'First detection of Hydrogen recombination lines toward an ionized jet arising from a high-mass protostar. We propose to observe hydrogen recombination line (HRL) emission from the triple radio continuum source associated with IRAS 16532-3959, thought to correspond to a luminous (7.0 x 10^4 Lsun) young high-mass protostar. The triple source consists of a recently discovered central ionized jet and two outer lobes, which signpost shocks resulting from the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium. The capabilities provided by ALMA Early Science enable for the first time measurements of the kinematical and dynamical properties of jets and lobes and link their energetic properties with those of larger scale phenomena such as bipolar molecular outflows. IRAS 16532-3959 is the most massive protostar known to be associated with a collimated jet and is therefore an excellent first target to be included in the much-anticipated first round of ALMA studies of jets and outflows.',\n"," 'Molecular gas distributions in compact dusty star-forming galaxies at z=2. Recent ALMA observations of massive star-forming galaxies have revealed that the dust continuum emission is more compact than the optical continuum emission. This finding potentially suggests radially inward transport of gas (compaction), but the spatial distribution of molecular gas has been little investigated by CO observtions. We here propose to make deep 0.5\"-resolution observations of CO(3-2) emission line in six compact dusty star-forming galaxies at z=2 in JWST/NIRCam deep fields. The half-light radius of the 870 um continuum emission is less than 1 kpc. We will measure the CO sizes by the proposed observations, and threafter compare them with the 870 um and the rest-optical sizes to study the difference in the distributions of molecular gas, dust, and stars. If the CO sizes are smaller than the stellar mass sizes, it would support the compaction scenario holds, and massive galaxies will rapidly form a dense core via concentration of gas. Otherwise, the star formation efficiency would become higher, owing to dense gas in the galaxy center, thereby resulting in a compact starburst.',\n"," 'Unveiling molecular gas contents within normal star-forming galaxies at z~3.3. Star-forming galaxies at z=3-4 are expected to be in a phase of an accelerated growth towards z~2, which requires a gas inflow from the outside. Such a prominent gas inflow is also suggested from the observational results that star-forming galaxies at z>3 do not follow the same stellar mass-SFR-gas metallicity relation as galaxies at z=0-2. At z > 3, the cosmological gas inflow is likely to be dominant and hence cause the dilution of gas metallicity. In order to investigate how the inflow/outflow processes are involved in the star formation activities and interstellar medium conditions of young galaxies at z>3, it is essential to measure the molecular gas contents of these galaxies. We propose dust continuum observations at Band-6 of 12 star-forming galaxies at z~3.3, for which we have already measured gas metallicities from the Keck/MOSFIRE spectra. We estimate molecular gas masses from the dust continuum and derive gas mass fractions and star formation efficiencies by taking into account the gas metallicities. Moreover, by combining the gas metallicities, SFRs and gas mass fractions with chemical evolution models, we will constrain the inflow/outflow rates of galaxies at z~3.3.',\n"," 'Probing Accretion Flows from Filaments to Massive Star-Forming Cores. We propose to investigate filamentary accretion flows in the remarkable IRDC complexes, M17 SWex, where a delayed onset of massive star formation has been reported. Such delay may be explained by a longer accretion time for high-mass end of protostellar mass funciton. Indeed, the dense clumps in this IRDC are found to be at the convergence of multiple filaments of parsec length and display the morphology of hub-filament systems. These hubs are likely nurturing massive protostars and accrete mass through their connecting filaments. We plan to 1) determine the mass accretion rate through filaments to hubs by observing the inflow motions along filaments with N2H+ (1-0); 2) assess the fragmentation in the filaments by identifying dense cores with the N2H+ and continuum emissions; 3) estimate mass accretion onto filaments from the surroudnings by detecting infall collapse onto filaments with HNC (1-0). We will perform a mosaic of 57 fields in Band 3 to cover two hubs and their associated filaments.',\n"," 'The Atomic to Molecular Ratio and Shocks in the Circumnuclear Disk of Centaurus A. Centaurus A (NGC5128) is by far the nearest powerful radio galaxy and our best candidate for detailed studies of the ISM properties of the circumnuclear disk (CND), feeding mechanisms of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and feedback on the surrounding gas. In this proposal we aim to study the atomic and shocked gas of the CND by using the atomic [CI] fine structure line 3P1 - 3P0 (492GHz) and the shock tracers CH3OH (2K - 1K) (96 GHz) and HNCO (5 0,5 - 40,4) (109 GHz) at 10 pc resolution (~0.5), to be compared with our previous ALMA CO(3-2) and CO(6-5) maps towards the CND (Espada et al. 2017). Using APEX observations over the CND, Israel et al. (2014) found a considerably strong [CI] line compared to CO(5-4), being the ratio larger than in the majority of starburst/AGN nearby galaxies. With the observations here proposed we will: 1) investigate the properties of the atomic gas versus the molecular gas within the CND, 2) to confirm or refute the existence of an atomic outflow component that has been recently proposed (Israel et al. 2017), and 3) to study the location and properties of shocked gas as produced by non-circular motions.',\n"," 'Molecular gas streams around the intermediate-mass black hole candidates in the Galactic center. Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are key objects to understand the origin of supermassive BHs (SMBHs). However, definitive evidence for IMBHs has not been obtained yet. Recently, the discovery of interesting molecular gas streams has been reported near the Galactic nucleus. These sub-pc scale streams show clear orbital motions around two invisible gravitational sources, which may be massive IMBHs or highly dense clusters mainly consisting of dark stellar remnants such as neutron stars and stellar-mass BHs. Here, we propose high-resolution (0.2 arcsec) molecular line and continuum observations toward the gas streams in ALMA band 6 and 7. The principal objective is to probe mass distribution of the putative gravitational sources and examine the IMBH hypothesis by investigating the detailed kinematics and physical conditions of the streams. We also aim to resolve mysterious ultra-compact (d<0.04 pc) clumps with extremely broad velocity widths (dV~50 km/s) located around the two IMBH candidates. This project would potentially fill the \"missing link\" between stellar mass BHs and SMBHs, contributing to further understanding of galactic evolution.',\n"," 'Probing Planet-Disk Interactions in the Fomalhaut System. The Fomalhaut system hosts both an iconic, eccentric debris disk and a hotly debated directly imaged companion, Fomalhaut b, whose orbit may pass through the disk in the future. The proximity of this system (7.7 pc) makes it a unique target to characterize dynamical interactions between a debris disk and its underlying planetary system at high spatial resolution. We propose high resolution Cycle 5 ALMA observations targeted at the pericenter and apocenter sides of the Fomalhaut debris disk to explore the nature of planet-disk interactions in the system. These new observations will allow us to (1) resolve azimuthal width variations, which will determine whether the disk is being shaped through secular perturbations by a planet, (2) identify any additional small-scale substructure in the disk, and (3) constrain whether the proposed planet, Fomalhaut b, is truly a planet or instead a dust cloud.',\n"," 'Close-up of a Globule in the Helix Nebula. High resolution imaging has shown that the Helix, one of the nearest planetary nebulae, is composed of a spectacular array of thousands of comet-like globules. Their origin is controversial, but they are known to consist of small, dense condensations of molecular gas with planet-like masses. We propose to make the first resolved observations of the molecular gas deep inside a globule of the Helix. Our observations in 12CO and 13CO (2-1) will probe the internal structure and kinematics of the core in unprecedented detail. The results will provide crucial information for evaluating theoretical models of the origin and evolution of these enigmatic objects.

ALMA offers a truly unique insight into the Sun by providing a linear thermometer into the chromosphere. These layers of the chromosphere are largely unstudied or have been muddled by line-of-sight effects common to optically thin measurements. Here we intend to use the advantages of ALMA in order to study one of the most readily available signatures of magnetic reconnection, microflares, in the chromosphere: the region through which the energy and plasma must flow to get into the corona. By observing the statistics of microflaring in two wavelengths, we will be able to better constrain the heights and dynamics of energy transfer in the chromosphere during magnetic reconnection.',\n"," 'When terrestrial planets collide: imaging the aftermath of an impact in the Solar neighbourhood. Terrestrial planet formation continues past the gas-rich protoplanetary phase, in 10-100 Myr-old planetary systems. This is the era of giant impacts, where embryos grow through collisions to form terrestrial planets. The HD172555 system is, to date, the only one with conclusive evidence of an impact in the Solar neighbourhood, amenable to characterization. Warm dust with the unique spectral fingerprint of an impact and the recent ALMA detection of CO gas from atmospheric stripping at 8 au inequivocably represent the leftovers of a planetary collision. We propose a deep, high-resolution (0.1\") ALMA Band 7 program to resolve the aftermath of this giant impact, measuring the spatial distribution of the debris and its molecular composition. These observables will constrain the progenitor mass, the timing since the collision and the post-impact gas chemistry of an extrasolar terrestrial impact for the first time. Through this program, we will exploit the only opportunity we have to image the aftermath of a giant impact in our Solar neighbourhood, and in doing so constrain models of planetary-scale collisions in unprecedented detail.',\n"," 'Properties of the interstellar medium around the supermassive black hole at the centre of the radio galaxy M87. The archetypal giant elliptical galaxy at the centre of the Virgo cluster, M87 (3C 274), is a unique object in which to study the origin and properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in a radio galaxy located in a dense environment. CO J=1-0 emission from the molecular gas in the inner part of M87 has been detected with the IRAM-30m telescope, and the molecular gas likely resides in a circumnuclear disk-like structure. While a very well-known object across most of the electromagnetic spectrum, M87 still lacks a detailed study in the (sub)millimeter range, requiring an advance in both sensitivity and angular resolution. The unique ALMA Cycle 1 capabilities will allow us to make the first detailed investigation of the properties of the ISM around the supermassive black hole at the centre of M87. We wish to use bands 3 and 7 to map the CO J=1-0 and CO J=3-2 lines, respectively, to trace the bulk of the molecular gas and the warmer denser gas, and in addition image the continuum emission, at an angular resolution of 1 arcsecond (~80 pc). Such observations are not currently possible with any other facility and will dramatically improve our knowledge of this archetypal radio galaxy. With a small investment of ALMA time we will achieve the deepest and highest spatial resolution image yet of the molecular gas content and excitation of a giant elliptical galaxy.',\n"," 'Propagation of cosmic rays in molecular clouds interacting with a supernova remnant. Cosmic rays (CRs) are a major component of the Galaxy. Especially, since low-energy CRs lose their energy via ionization, they are believed to have a strong influence on the chemical evolution in molecular clouds and on star and planet formation. However, the influence of CRs has been discussed only hypothetically in theories because the propagation process of CRs in molecular clouds is highly unknown. A recent study noted that CR protons with E~0.01 MeV, ~10 MeV, ~GeV attribute to the ionization rate, Fe I Ka line, and Gamma-ray emission, and indicated that the relative spatial distributions among the the three observables are the key to reveal the propagation process. Actually, there are no samples where the three observables were measured in the same region. We focus on the southwestern edge of the supernova remnant W44, where both the Fe I Ka line and gamma-rays are detected. We propose DCO+ (J=2-1) and H13CO (J=1-0) observations at two positions in this region to measure the ionization rate and its spatial distribution. This observation will reveal the propagation of MeV CRs observationally for the first time.',\n"," 'SO and CCH Zeeman in IRAS 20126+4104: Measuring Magnetic Fields around a High-mass Protostar. Measuring magnetic field strengths around protostars is a crucial part of testing theories of magnetically-driven accretion. While polarization from magnetically-aligned dust grains or the Goldriech-Kylafis effect can trace the magnetic field morphology, the Zeeman effect offers a direct probe of line-of-sight magnetic field strengths. To date, ALMA has not successfully detected the Zeeman effect. To increase the chances of detecting the Zeeman effect, we propose to observe an object whose high accretion rate implies a strong magnetic field: the high-mass protostar IRAS 20126+4104. In addition to its high accretion rate, this protostar stands out as a target due to the presence of a Keplerian disk, a Zeeman-sensitive spectral line, and a previous magnetic field strength measurement with which to compare our magnetic field strengths. We plan to target eight Zeeman-sensitive SO and CCH transitions to measure magnetic field strengths in the disk, outflow cavity, and outflow of IRAS 20126+4104. These observations will test ALMAs capability to directly measure magnetic field strengths and improve our understanding of magnetic accretion in circumstellar disks.',\n"," 'Zooming into a Swift/BAT-selected buried AGN of NGC 7172 with a candidate dispersion-dominated thick gaseous disk. We propose to conduct 0.1\" or 16-pc resolution ALMA Band-6 observations of CO(2-1) at the nucleus of NGC 7172, hosting a \"New-type\" AGN selected by the Swift/BAT all sky survey. Subsequent X-ray spectroscopy suggests the fractions of scattered soft X-rays w.r.t.the direct emission is only < 0.2%, an order of magnitude smaller than classical type-2 Seyferts (1 - 3%). Furthermore, our recent ~100-pc resolution ALMA observations of CO(2-1) reveal a drastic increase of the velocity dispersion to rotation velocity ratio, sigma/Vrot, a key indicator of the disk thickness, at r<100 pc of NGC 7172. These facts make NGC 7172 a promising target hosting a SMBH embedded by a geometrically thick torus with a very small opening angle. Our primary goal is to test if the CO(2-1) gas disk in NGC 7172 exhibits a high sigma/Vrot ratio beyond unity, which supports the presence of geometrically thick cold molecular material in the central ~10 pc region of a new-type AGN. We will also search for any signature of molecular outflows at r<100pc, to compare with the putative OH outflow by Herschel and ~kpc scale outflow uncovered in the previous ALMA data.',\n"," 'Shedding Light on Distant Starburst Galaxies Hosting Dust-Obscured gamma-ray Bursts. Studies of distant starburst galaxies hosting GRBs offer unique insights into extreme star-forming regions during early epochs. In particular, 25-40% of all GRBs show a suppressed optical to x-ray ratio in the afterglow. A likely explanation is that they originate in dusty galaxies, which are commonly missed in optical surveys. We have carried out a successful program in ALMA Cycle 0 to observe the galaxy hosting the dark GRB 080607 at z = 3.036. We obtained a marginal detection of its 345 GHZ continuum, placing it at the faintest end of the dusty galaxy population. This indicates that the large extinction (Av ~ 3) in the afterglow is confined along a dusty sight line, contrary to the expectation of the host galaxy itself being dusty. Here we propose to conduct a systematic study of nine galaxies hosting dust-obscured GRBs at z > 1.5 based on observations of their 345 GHz continuum. All nine galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts to confirm that the suppressed optical fluxes are indeed due to extinction, rather than IGM absorption. The proposed imaging will allow us to characterize the global dust content of the host galaxies in a broader context of the dusty galaxy population.',\n"," 'Weighing Supermassive Black Holes with ALMA. Ubiquitely present at the centres of galaxies, black holes are central to understanding galaxy evolution. However, the correlations driving most theoretical efforts (e.g. black hole mass-central velocity dispersion relation) are based on a relatively small number of measurements and only a handful of methods. Our recent work with CARMA has however shown that it is possible to dynamically estimate the mass of supermassive black holes, by simply probing the near-Keplerian rotation of molecular disks around them at high angular resolution. This is a highly promising method, and in the ALMA era it will make possible hundreds of measurements across galaxies of all morphological types. In Cycle 2, it is already possible to exploit extended array configurations to measure the black hole mass in carefully selected objects. We therefore request here high angular resolution CO(3-2) line imaging of three promising targets spanning much of the Hubble sequence: NGC4429 (SA0), NGC4861 (SAab), and NGC3351 (SBb). With these data, we will probe their molecular gas kinematics on nuclear scales, weigh their black holes, and test the reliability of our measurement method.',\n"," 'A Precision Test of Gamma-ray Burst Afterglow Models. GRBs are powered by extreme compact objects (e.g. black holes or magnetars) that eject matter at ultra-relativistic velocities (Lorentz factor >>100). This makes them ideal laboratories to study radiation processes in extreme conditions. Up to now the Swift satellite has detected >1000 GRB afterglows but only 20-30 were bright enough for extensive follow-up from radio to X-ray wavelengths to provide crucial constraints on the radiation processes. Swift has been in orbit for more than 11 years. Although all systems are still fully operational, the window to test the afterglow models gradually gets smaller. Those tests are fundamental and address key difficulties in understanding physics of cosmic particle-accelerators. Because of this, we propose a joint ALMA+JCMT+NOEMA proposal to study one GRB afterglow with a peak flux of >1 mJy from early (hours) to late times (months) for the first time. We propose to secure 5 epochs at 92 and 332 GHz separated by 7-14 days in each band. We will complement these observations with X-ray to radio data to model the broadband afterglow. This allows us to precisely test models and characterise non-standard radiation components.',\n"," 'Search for Submillimeter H2O Maser Towards Active Galactic Nuclei. We propose to search for submillimeter H2O masers towards active galactic nuclei (AGN). Galaxies in our sample are listed from known 22 GHz \"disk\" masers showing the presence of a sub-parsec scale disk or characteristic spectra. These sample galaxies show the strongest flux density of the 22 GHz H2O maser among about 150 H2O extragalactic masers known to date. Our primary aim of this program is 1) to study distribution of temperature and density in sub-parsec scale regions of AGN by detecting different transitions of submillimeter (submm) H2O masers at 22 GHz, 183 GHz, 321 GHz, and 325 GHz. First of all, we need to detect the 321/325 GHz transition in this Cycle 0 program. Since the pumping mechanism of these transitions is similar, we might be able to discover the new submm H2O maser in the largely same region and in the same galaxies as the 22 GHz maser exists, or new masers could be potentially detected in unexplored region of AGN, 2) by monitoring the line of sight velocity of the maser, we aim to detect systemic accelerations, assuming the submm maser lying on a rotating disk. Also, we aim the first detection of the accelerations of the maser on the back side of the disk. We have more chance to detect it since submm continuum emission obscuring the maser on the back side could become optically thin. This will confirm the generally accepted rotation disk model, and 3) to provide the line intensity ratio between the transitions, which will be critical for developing the numerical simulation, based on radiative transfer model.',\n"," 'Probing the star formation process and dark matter halos of superthin galaxies. We here propose to map the molecular gas in a complete sample of nearby massive superthin galaxies. Superthin galaxies are spiral galaxies that exhibit extraordinarily large disk axial ratios (>10) and no discernible bulge component. The formation of such object in the hierarchical LamdaCDM context is not well understood, and these observations will shed light on two of the biggest ongoing controversies. Firstly, we will determine the efficiency of star formation in such systems. They are predicted to form stars very efficiently thanks to the low dynamical stability of their gas discs (caused by the razor thin nature of their stellar discs), but yet have somehow retained their gas and low surface brightness stellar discs for a Hubble time. Secondly, we will dynamically determine the shape of the dark matter halo profile in the inner parts of these objects, which are expected to be extremely dark matter dominated. In summary, a short investment of ALMA time will allow us to probe the impact of stellar structure on star formation, and reveal the dark matter halo properties of these enigmatic objects.',\n"," 'What is Carving the Gaps in Young, Embedded Disks?. Protoplanetary disks with ages of 1-5 Myr are often found with large holes in their centers. These \"transition\" disks are hypothesized to be carved out by planets hiding in the inner regions of the disk, and indeed some evidence has been found for planets hiding in such gaps. In our ALMA Cycles 3 & 4 observations of young (<0.5 Myr) embedded disks, we found several cases of embedded protostars that have a large cavities in their disk as well. However, our existing observations are insufficient to determine the underlying cause of these holes, whether it be large bodies such as planets or protostars, dust grain growth, or photoevaporation. Here we propose to observe a sample of 7 Class 0/I \"transition disks\" in continuum and gas lines to determine the clearing mechanism. Planets, multiplicity, dust grain growth, and photoevaporation each leave a distinct imprint on the dust and gas, and our proposed observations will have the power to distinguish between each scenario. If planets could be shown to be carving this hole, it would place very strong constraints on the timescales on which planet formation begins.',\n"," 'After the Fall: Mapping the Molecular Fuel in Post-Starburst Galaxies. To explain the nature of present day galaxies, contemporary models of galaxy evolution require feedback to expel a substantial fraction of the gas and dust fueling stellar and black hole growth, driving galaxies into quiescence. Post-starburst galaxies are systems found precisely in this phase - shortly after star formation has been abruptly halted - but little is known about the dust and gas content of these systems. We have recently discovered surprisingly large reservoirs of dust and molecular gas in a sample of post-starbursts. Incredibly, they are producing stars at a pace more than 10x below what is expected. A critical question is why this gas is not forming stars in line with the well-studied SF law. To understand the fate of molecular fuel after quenching, we propose deep CO 2-1 mapping of 8 post-starbursts with well-measured molecular gas and dust masses, sampling a wide range of precisely determined post-burst ages from 0.3-1.5Gyr. Continuum measurements at 1.3mm will also provide powerful contraints on cold dust content. ALMA alone has the sensitivity and resolution needed to probe the state of the dusty molecular fuel left behind in galaxies After the Fall.',\n"," 'Establishing the Best Tracers of Molecular Outflows Across Redshift and Galaxy Properties. One of the most important realizations of the last fifteen years is the vital role that feedback must play in the evolution of galaxies. Large-scale galactic winds driven by supernovae and/or AGN are often invoked as the means by which feedback occurs. In Cycle 4, we detected massive molecular outflows in several z~4-5.5 dusty galaxies seen in blueshifted absorption of the OH 119um line, the \"gold standard\" tracer of molecular winds. Due to its high rest frequency, however, this line is difficult to observe at z<4. Here, we propose to establish the effectiveness of two alternative molecular outflow tracers which can be observed with ALMA across essentially all redshifts. Previous observations of these lines have shown a variety of outcomes, from non-detections to full P Cygni profiles, but it is unclear whether the wind non-detections are due to geometric effects or because the lines are not useful tracers. By targeting systems with known winds, we can determine which line is the most faithful tracer in comparison to OH 119um, the best available diagnostic. Finally, due to their formation pathways, the molecules we target will allow us to constrain the wind driving mechanism.',\n"," 'ColdSINS: an ALMA cold gas census of the deepest near-IR IFU+AO sample of z~2 star-forming galaxies. We propose a census of the cold gas content from sensitive ALMA 870um continuum observations of 35 z~2 galaxies from SINS/zC-SINF, the deepest and highest resolution near-IR IFU sample in existence. This sample, probing the star-forming galaxy population over two orders of magnitude in mass, has exquisite 0.15\" resolution AO-assisted SINFONI data of the Halpha+[NII] line emission and deep HST near-IR imaging, giving maps of the kinematics, star formation, metallicities, outflows, stellar light and mass on ~1kpc scales. These substantial campaigns (650 VLT hours + 126 HST orbits) led to several breakthroughs that helped shape our current understanding of galaxy evolution. For a modest 15.0 hrs investment, ColdSINS will obtain the first direct constraints on the mass and extent of the cold gas in these galaxies at high sensitivity (RMS=0.05mJy) and ~0.9\" resolution. This knowledge is also prerequisite to future high-resolution ALMA follow-ups. This is a resubmission of a Cycle 6 proposal ranked in the top quartile but not scheduled due to oversubscription. We will provide the community with the reduced ALMA data, complementing the already released reduced SINFONI+AO sets.',\n"," 'Testing the cold ISM removal mechanism in passive galaxies. One of the key issues lacking in our understanding of cosmic dust is how galaxies are getting rid of it. It is tricky to track dust removal, because usually dust is constantly replenished by consecutive generations of stars. In order to overcome this we selected dusty passive galaxies, which still have detectable dust content, but exhibit a low current supernova dust production (and destruction) rate due to the long time since the last major star formation event. Therefore any decline of dust content as a function of their age can be attributed to dust removal. We found that their dust and gas content declines rapidly at ages > 2 Gyr, allowing us to constrain the timescale of the ISM removal in these galaxies. However, an important aspect of the nature of this mechanism needs to be tested: is the removal of the ISM due to outflows or do we detect the effect of heating of gas, which destroys dust and molecular gas? Distinguishing this would allow us to understand how passive galaxies are getting rid of the ISM, and we plan to achieve this via high-resolution CO(1-0) observations to look for signatures of outflows.',\n"," 'Direct Measurement of Inner and Outer Disk Misalignment. Results from the Kepler mission suggest that exoplanetary systems are divided into two distinct populations - one with coplanar planets, and one with planets that have significant mutual inclinations (the \"Kepler Dichotomy\"). One explanation for this phenomenon is that dynamical processes may force planets into orbits with high mutual inclinations. These planets may interact with the disk and generate a misaligned disk structure, or vice-versa. Theory has long suggested the presence of dynamically generated disk misalignments, and recent scattered light observations with SPHERE provide indirect evidence for such systems via inner disk shadows. Recent ALMA observations show similar evidence for a misalignment in the AA Tau disk, with symmetric shadows visible in the innermost dust ring. Bright inner disk emission provides a unique opportunity to directly measure the inner and outer disk misalignment angle by observing the disk at high angular resolution and resolving its geometry. These observations will provide the first direct measurement of a disk misalignment, confirming the hypothesized phenomenon and providing a benchmark system for theoretical dynamical models.',\n"," 'Resolved, Spatially Complete Maps of Dense Gas Tracers in LMC Clouds. We request 11.1h of main array time to obtain sensitive (64mK) 12m+7m+tp maps of the emission from Band 3 dense gas tracers at 1pc+0.8km/s resolution across the full CO-emitting extent of five molecular clouds in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our target clouds have existing ALMA maps of the CO isotopologues and span a range of star formation activity. We will use the data to study the spatial organization and velocity field of the dense gas within each cloud, the distributions of intensity, linewidth and line profile shape parameters for each tracer, and their relationship to the physical properties of CO-emitting structures. The proposed maps will build a bridge between highly resolved Galactic work and kpc-scale results from more distant systems, a key to understanding the physics that drives extragalactic scaling laws relating `dense gas and star formation.',\n"," 'Mapping out the Changing Dust Properties of High-redshift Galaxies. ALMA has by now firmly established the importance and ubiquity of dust at high redshift (z > 5). However, our understanding of the physical properties of the earliest dust in galaxies remains severely limited by the scarcity of multi-band follow-up, and the few existing multi-band studies focusing solely on observations near the peak of the dust SED. Crucially, this leaves the dust emissivity index (beta) fully unconstrained, preventing any insight into the composition and size distribution of high-z dust grains, as well as introducing major systematic uncertainties in our knowledge of dust temperatures (+/- 30 K), masses and luminosities (> 0.5 dex). We here propose for Band 4 + 9 observations of 5 normal star-forming galaxies at 5 < z < 7.5 with existing multi-band ALMA data in order to 1) robustly measure dust emissivity indices in the first Gyr of cosmic time, and 2) accurately constrain dust temperatures and masses of high-z galaxies free from systematic uncertainties. With these observations, we will elucidate if galaxy dust properties evolve across cosmic time, and shed new light on the rate and efficiency of dust build-up in the early Universe.',\n"," 'What drives the formation of super-Jeans cores?. Interstellar filaments represent a key stage towards the formation of stars. As they become gravitationally unstable, filaments fragment into cores, the direct progenitors of stars. The typical Jeans mass of such filaments is about a solar mass. This raises the question about the formation and support meachnism of super-Jeans cores, i.e. cores that are several time more massive than the Jeans mass. A local increase of the gas velocity dispersion (i.e. turbulence) is a commonly invoked physical mechanism to support such Super-Jeans cores against gravity and further fragmentation. We propose to use ALMA to observe apparently starless, super-Jeans cores of the SDC13 infrared dark cloud. We see local increases of the gas velocity dispersion for 20 out of the 32 detected cores. We aim to understand how these local peaks in velocity dispersion manifest, and what are the consequences on the formation of intermediate-/high-mass stars.',\n"," 'Mapping the Star Formation in SPT0311-58. We request a deep, sub-kpc resolution map of the OIII 88um line emission from a unique system of dusty galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). SPT0311-58 is a system of massive interacting galaxies at z=6.900 that was found via their millimeter-wavelength dust emission in the South Pole Telescope survey. In previous cycles we have shown these galaxies to reside in an extremely massive dark matter halo, reconstructed the spatial/velocity structure of the galaxy pair through a pixelated lens modeling technique, and measured their dust, gas, and stellar content. We now have <0.1\"-resolution images of this system in both continuum and the 158um CII line, which show the two main galaxies to be composed of clumpy high-velocity-dispersion regions of star formation. We propose to augment these maps with the high-ionization OIII line, which should emit only in regions of active star formation and around accreting black holes. With OIII, CII, and continuum information we will explore the distribution of star formation in z~7 galaxies, trace the assembly history of these objects, and better understand the utility of the OIII line for future observations of even higher redshift galaxies.',\n"," 'A Molecular ALMA Deep Field in the UDF. To date, our understanding of the molecular gas content in high-redshift galaxies is fundamentally limited by pre-selection of the galaxies at other wavelengths (optical/NIR/IR, sub-millimeter, radio). To overcome this, we propose an unbiased molecular deep field (CO spectral scan of band 3, covering all z>1) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We will reach a molecular mass limit that is an order of magnitude deeper than previously possible, below the expected knee of the CO luminosity function. We expect to detect >20 galaxies (both in line and continuum) and these detections will be compared to (1) our detailed SED modeling of all galaxies in the UDF (2) our analytic-empirical models that build on our current understanding of high-redshift molecular gas and (3) the latest adaptive moving mesh cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include molecular gas. Stacking (both 2D and 3D) will push the statistical detection of sources to unprecedented depths. In summary, we will put unbiased observational constraints on the redshift-dependent CO luminosity function and meaningfully constrain the cosmic evolution of the universal molecular gas density for the first time.',\n"," 'Large scale infall or local collapse forms massive clusters?. The origin of the distribution of stellar masses, in particular of massive stars, is one of the most fundamental open questions of modern astrophysics. Whether they form by a high-level of supersonic micro-turbulence, converging flows or large-scale global collapse is still not settled. We therefore aim here at an unprecedentedly complete view on the kinematics of star forming gas towards the recently discovered most pristine massive clump known to date, G23.21-0.38, based on the ATLASGAL 870 micron survey and its spectroscopic follow-ups. Using high density cold gas tracers (HNC, HCO+, HN13C) we want to look for signatures of global collapse initiated on large scale (>35), converging flows, and compare the kinematics with the location of dense cores on small scales (2). The targeted source is entirely dominated by cold gas on a 6 pc scale, and we have strong evidence for a deeply embedded high-mass protostar exhibiting class II methanol maser emission, broad outflow wings, and a particularly high mass infall rate towards its center. We aim to reveal whether local or global collapse sets in first for forming rich clusters.',\n"," 'Revealing planet migration via dust substructures in isolated outer disks. Planets are thought to migrate as they grow and evolve in their parent protoplanetary disk, due to the balance of gravitational and pressure torques. Migration is commonly invoked to explain the existence of hot Jupiters and the concentration of low-mass exoplanets at small orbital radii. In general, several processes can influence the rate of planet migration, and result in both inward or outward drifts. But there is little observational evidence of migration beyond the empirical motivation found in the Solar System. Using ALMA, we found signatures of planet migration via dust structures in the outer region of a gapped disk. HD169142 has a system of three fine rings with asymmetric mutual separations. A single low mass planet can account for the triple ring structure, while its inward migration naturally explains the rings mutual separations. Here, we aim to explore whether the observation in HD169142 is a rare anecdote, or if it reflects a universal phenomenon in gapped disks outer regions. We will test for low-mass planet signatures in HD97048, whose outer region shows hints of a tripple-ring that can be used to inform on the radial migration of the embedded perturber.',\n"," 'Spatially resolving the CO excitation in a lensed, normal star-forming galaxy at z=1.7. CO observations are widely used to assess the molecular gas content of galaxies. At high-redshift, only the higher CO transitions are accessible at submillimeter wavelengths. The CO excitation ladder needed to convert such measurements to a molecular gas mass is very poorly understood, with up to an order of magnitude uncertainty in the conversion factor for high-J lines. Recent observations and numerical simulations are finding a correlation between CO excitation and star formation surface density, with much higher excitations for massive star-forming clumps with high SF surface densities. We propose observations of the CO(3-2), CO(6-5) and CO(8-7) transition for an exceptionally bright lensed galaxy at z=1.7. Together with proposed CO(1-0) observations from the eVLA, the extreme magnification and extent of the arc will allow us to spatially resolve the excitation ladder over multiple clumps and interclump regions, even at moderate resolution of 1.5\". This will be the first spatially resolved observation of CO excitation in a normal star-forming galaxy at high redshift and a direct test of current theoretical models',\n"," 'Velocity and density power spectra along the Musca filament: Hints to the origin of the star formation properties. There is a growing evidence of the key role of molecular filaments in the star formation process. Important questions are to understand the physical processes 1) leading to the fragmentation of these filaments into bound cores and 2) governing the properties of these cores (e.g., mass distribution and angular momentum). Recent theoretical studies suggest that the fragmentation of a self-gravitating filament characterized by a velocity power spectrum with a slope of -5/3 (i.e., a Kolmogorov spectrum) may be at the origin of the observed mass distribution of cores and their angular momentum. Here we propose ACA band 3 and 6 observations to trace the molecular emission of C18O(1-0) and (2-1) along Musca, a low-mass filament at the verge of gravitational fragmentation, to derive for the first time its velocity power spectrum and test the theoretical models. Thanks to the two C18O transitions we will also have the required data to constrain the density and temperature of Musca and derive an accurate estimate of the line-of-sight depth to constrain the 3D structure of the Musca cloud: cylindrical filament or sheet-like.',\n"," 'Unveiling the population of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies with ALMA 1.2 mm imaging. Submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) are dusty star-forming galaxies at high-z that directly trace the most intense episodes of stellar mass build-up in massive galaxies. Despite the large progress in understanding their properties, all we currently know about SMGs is severely affected by the biases imposed by the traditional radio/IR counterpart identification methods. We propose to perform ALMA 1.2 mm continuum imaging of a complete, flux-limited sample of 129 SMGs in the COSMOS field. These observations will allow us to find unambiguous counterparts and thus perform a critical, unbiased analysis of the SMG properties. Taking advantage of the unprecedented multi-wavelength and photometric redshift coverage of the COSMOS field, this will provide a legacy sample to study the cosmic evolution, dust properties, masses and environments of SMGs. Most importantly, we will quantify the intrinsic redshift distribution, providing a conclusive measurement to the abundance of SMGs at z>4. Finally, this study will illuminate the homogeneity or diversity of the SMG population, possibly changing our view of their evolution and role in the formation of massive ellipticals.',\n"," 'Characterizing the volcanic contribution in Ios atmosphere. Jupiters moon Io possesses a tenuous SO2-dominated atmosphere that feeds the plasma torus in orbit around Jupiter, hence requiring a continuous replenishment mechanism. While the primary origin of the gas is volcanic, it is unclear whether the bulk atmosphere is directly supplied by the volcanic plumes, or if it is mainly sustained by sublimation of SO2 frosts. The volcanic gas composition itself, that depends on the magma composition and the volcanic conduit conditions, is not known. The purpose of this proposal is to bring new constraints on the contribution of volcanism to Ios atmosphere. A chemical search for expected yet undetected volcanic species such as SiO, KCl, S2O and CO is proposed, with an unprecedented sensitivity, aiming at constraing the ionian volcanic regimes. Maps of the main atmospheric species (SO2, SO and NaCl) will be obtained with the best resolution ever achieved at this wavelength (0.3\"), in order to correlate the gas distribution with potential sources (volcanic centers, frost patches), as well as to verify the presence of SO2 in cold, polar regions where sublimation is neglectable. In addition, a map of the wind-field will be obtained by measuring Doppler-shifts on the strongest SO2 lines. This will allow to verify if the wind circulation follows a day-to-night pattern, that would be expected in the case of a sublimation sustained atmosphere, or if the circulation is zonal, as was observed by our team on IRAM observations of much lesser quality.',\n"," 'Into the Mystic: testing the role of ionizing feedback in regulating star formation. Feedback plays a critical but poorly understood role in regulating star formation. Momentum injected by photoionization of fresh material off of cloud surfaces has recently been recognized to play an important role in the evolution and eventual destruction of molecular clouds. This may compress the gas, fostering star formation or drive turbulence, preventing collapse. Theoretical models predict measurable differences in the kinematics and star formation efficiencies in feedback-altered gas. We propose to map the Mystic Mountains, a heavily irradiated complex of dust pillars in the Carina Nebula to measure the kinematics of gas subject to intense stellar feedback. Using the ACA in stand-alone mode, we will measure the distribution of (1) turbulence as a function of distance from the ionization front and (2) protostars forming within the cloud complex. These observations also allow us to constrain pillar formation models and estimate the cloud destruction timescale. Together with observations of the cold gas kinematics in less extreme regions, these data allow us to constrain the role of ionizing feedback in regulating star formation.',\n"," 'Testing the SFE bimodality: measuring the CO-to-H2 conversion factor in ULIRGs using 13CO. Local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are gas and dust-rich major mergers hosting strong starbursts. They have star-formation efficiencies (SFE) much higher than main-sequence galaxies and indeed the existence of a SFE bimodality has been suggested based on these differences. The SFE of ULIRGs relies on the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (alpha_CO) assumed for ULIRGs, ~4 times lower than the standard Galactic alpha_CO. Warmer, denser, and more turbulent ISM in ULIRGs could justify a reduced CO optical depth and, hence, a reduced alpha_CO. However, the nuclear gas column densities in ULIRGs are very high and recent spatially resolved ALMA data suggest highly suppressed 12CO emission in, at least, some ULIRGs, which would be at odds with a reduced alpha_CO. We propose to observe the optically thinner 13CO isotopologue in a representative sample, in terms of interaction stage and nuclear 12CO emission suppression (from flat-top to Gaussian-like line profiles), of ULIRGs (10 new + 2 archive). We will determine the nuclear optical depths using radiative transfer models and estimate their alpha_CO, which is key to establish their SFE and the existence (or not) of a bimodal SFE.',\n"," 'Molecules in supernova 1987A - chemistry, nucleosynthesis and gas dynamics. Supernovae (SNe) are the main source of chemical enrichment in galaxies. SN 1987A was the nearest SN explosion detected in 400 years. Since its discovery, SN 1987A has given us remarkable insights into the physics and chemistry of SNe. Our ALMA Cycle-0 detected molecular line emission in the SN ejecta, thus opened up an exciting new avenue of observational research, molecular astronomy in SNe. In this cycle-2 programme we propose an unbiased line survey of SN 1987A from 210 to 350 GHz. We aim to detect new species of molecules that have been predicted to form in SN ejecta, and to measure the emission from the isotopologues of these molecules, as well as their velocity profiles, densities and temperatures. Measurements of molecular isotopologue ratios will allow us to measure isotope ratios of C, O, S, Si. This will provide direct constraints on stellar yields from SN nuclosynthesis. These measurements of abundances for species other than CO and SiO will constrain not only chemical models. We will also measure the line profiles from different molecular species, tracing turbulent structure that resulted from the hydrodynamical instabilities caused by the SN explosion.',\n"," 'The Chemistry of Planet Formation. Planets form and obtain their compositions in dust and gas-rich disks around young stars. The planet forming process is intimately linked to the disk chemical structure. First, chemistry shapes the outcome of planet formation, including planetary hospitality to life. Second, the chemistry is sensitive to the distribution of dust and pebbles in disks, and as planets open up disk gaps they may change the chemical environment within which they form. Third, molecular emission is often the only tool we have to explore disk ionization levels, kinematics and mass distribution, all key ingredients of planet formation models. We propose a Large Program to map out the radial and vertical disk chemical structures at 10 au scales, in five disks where dust sub-structure is detected and planet formation appears to be ongoing. The resulting data will give us access to the chemistry in the planet forming zone of disks, explore how ongoing planet formation shape the disk chemistry environment, and constrain the disk gas properties in the previously unexplored inner disk midplane.',\n"," 'Chemical Composition of Molecular Clouds in the Nearby Metal-Poor Galaxy NGC6822. In metal-poor environments, chemical compositions of molecular clouds are different from that in our Galaxy. Based on our recent observations of the three low-metallicity galaxies, the LMC, IC10, and NGC6822, with the single dish telescopes, we found characteristic features of chemical compositions in metal-poor environments. Those are enhancement of CCH and deficiency of CH3OH, both of which originate from the low abundance of dust grains. This result would constitute an important base for studying chemical compositions of low-metallicity galaxies including distant galaxies, and hence, detailed verifications are necessary. In the above observations, the distances to IC10 and NGC6822 are much different from that of the LMC. For fair comparison of the molecular-cloud scale chemical compositions among these galaxies, we need to observe IC10 and NGC6822 at a high angular resolution. In this program, we observe NGC6822 in various molecular lines in Band 3 to derive the 10 pc scale chemical composition, which can be compared directly with the LMC result. Considering the growing importance of astrochemistry in extragalactic studies, our program is of fundamental importance.',\n"," 'Massive molecular outflows and negative feedback in active galaxies. We have recently found unambiguous evidence for massive molecular outflows in the Herschel-PACS OH spectra of a large number of nearby active galaxies. These outflows may represent the long sought evidence for the strong QSO mode feedback onto the host galaxy required by galaxy evolution models. Here we propose to use ALMA to study the same molecular outflows in 4 of our best Herschel targets by detecting and resolving the associated broad wings in CO(1-0). These observations will provide the necessary information on the geometry and size of the outflows to calibrate and test the assumptions made in the modeling of the Herschel OH spectra, which are of low spatial resolution. Combined, these data will allow us to determine the outflow rate and kinetic energy of these massive molecular winds and to derive the dominant mechanism driving them. They will also be extremely useful for the interpretation of future ALMA OH observations in the high redshift Universe.',\n"," 'Resolving molecular outflows in nearby luminous AGN from the CARS survey. We propose deep ALMA CO(1-0) line mapping at a resolution of 0.6\" for a sub-sample of 6 luminous nearby AGN from the spatially-resolved multi-wavelength Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS). Recent wide-field optical IFU spectroscopy with MUSE revealed the presence of ionized outflows on kpc scales around those AGN, given the presence of broad line wings with 300-900km/s FWHM. The ionized gas outflow rates are about one solar mass per year, close to the total star formation rate of these systems. Single-dish mm observations indicate a large overall cold gas content, but the integrated CO(1-0) spectra are dominated by quiescent, galaxy-spanning gas. ALMA observations are needed to 1) resolve the corresponding molecular outflows, thereby properly constraining the total outflowing gas mass and 2) study the spatially resolved star formation efficiency to test whether star formation is suppressed or enhanced due to the AGN, relative to control samples of galaxies drawn from CALIFA survey. Understanding the properties of AGN-driven outflows in these intermediate luminosity AGN is essential to link the closest low-luminosity AGN studied in detail and the powerful QSOs at higher redshift.',\n"," 'Probing photoevaporation in protoplanetary disks: the primordial to debris disk transition. Understanding the evolution of circumstellar disks around young stellar objects is crucial for theories of star and planet formation. Most young stellar objects are either accreting classical T Tauri stars with \"full\" disks or non-accreting weak-line T Tauri stars (WTTSs) with bare stellar photospheres, which implies that the transition phase between the two states must be very short. Currently, the only mechanism able to consistently explain the rapidly vanishing disks is photoevaporation by EUV/FUV or X-ray radiation. The photoevaporation of circumstellar gas is expected to mark the transition from the primordial to the debris disk stage. The objects most likely to be caught in this crucial disk evolution phase are WTTSs with weak levels of IR excesses. Such objects represent 20% of the WTTSs population, but the dust and gas content in their disks remain unknown. Here we propose to obtain deep continuum and CO line observations of 22 WTTS in 3 nearby (d ~ 160 pc) star-forming regions (Taurus, Lupus-Scorpius, and Chameleonis) in order to: 1) Conclusively distinguish between primordial photoevaporating disks from young debris disks for the first time in a sample of WTTSs, 2) Constrain disk photoevaporation rates by measuring the mass of primordial disks with photoevaporation-induced inner holes, which is key to test the predictions of different photoevaporation models (e.g., EUV, FUV, and X-ray photoevaporation), and 3) Constrain models of the early evolution of debris disks and the onset of the debris disk phenomenon.',\n"," 'Mapping Zeeman sensitive moleculaes in the Orion Filament with the ACA. Magnetic fields have been recognized to be of increading dynamical importance in molecular clouds, particularly in star forming regions. However, the only way to measure the magnetic field strength is through the Zeeman effect, which is challenging given the large sensitivity required. Thus, a first step is to find the strongest compact spots of emission from Zeeman sensitive molecules. Here we propose to map the SO and CN Zeeman sensitive molecules, along with continuum, with the ACA in selected regions of the Orion Filament.',\n"," 'Resolving atomic gas in the accretion flow surrounding Sgr A*. The Galactic center uniquely provides the opportunity to resolve the accretion flow onto the supermassive black hole on scales less than 5 pc. Our previous GBT-100m and SMA observations of molecular lines have revealed that the well-known 2-4 pc Galactic circumnuclear disk (CND) may consist of a convergence of several >2 pc scale molecular gas streams. The ionized mini-spiral arms in the inner ~1 pc radius further indicate that a portion of these molecular gas streams may penetrate inside the CND. However, the previous 22\" resolution OI line observations suggested that the ionized mini-spiral arms may be merely the ionized rim of the ~10 times more massive atomic gas streams. With this proposal, we seek to take advantage of the new CI observation capability of ALMA Band 8, to resolve these atomic gas streams at subarcsecond resolution. The aim of this proposal is to unveil detailed morphology and kinematics of the atomic accretion flows for the first time, and by using both the spatial distribution and the observed velocity field of the atomic gas, we will diagnose how it survives the ionizing flux when approaching the central OB cluster and the black hole.',\n"," 'Mapping the hot atmospheres of evolved stars. Shocks, convection and stellar activity have a major impact on the circumstellar chemistry and mass loss of evolved AGB stars. Surface and extended atmosphere studies of these stars have so far been limited to the visual to near-infrared wavelength ranges, with limited imaging capabilities, or the marginal resolving power offered at radio wavelengths. Using ALMA long baselines, we have resolved exquisit details of the stellar atmosphere of W Hya and Mira. For W Hya we show numerous hotspots close to the actual stellar photosphere, and a hot gas layer with temperature >5000 K. This firmly proves the existence of a (likely shock-heated) chromosphere that shows stellar activity. Only ALMA can image this activity, as at other wavelengths opacity sources limit our view on the stellar surface. Here we propose to map the stellar disk structure of W Hya and R Leo across three ALMA bands. Such observations are crucial for modeling the structure of AGB atmospheres, as our current results challenge almost all available models that underlie our understanding of AGB mass loss.',\n"," 'Investigating a bottleneck in the phosporous cycle, and a search for active volcanism on Venus. Venus hosts an extremely dense, dry, CO2 and sulphur-rich atmosphere, believed to be influenced by volcanic outgassing, yet evidence for present-day (active) volcanism on Venus is scarce. We propose to use the ACA to perform two related studies of Venuss atmosphere, to address its origin, evolution, composition and habitability. Our first objective is to observe the chloride salts NaCl and KCl as direct probes of active volcanic outgassing. Our second objective is to detect the PO and PS molecules to quantify the phosphorous budget in the upper atmosphere, thereby elucidating possible chemical pathways to phosphine (PH3) - a theorized biomarker.',\n"," 'The Origin of [C II] and [N II] Emission in High-z Dusty Starbursts. Far-IR [C II] 158 micron line and the [N II] 122 & 205 micron lines are important ISM cooling transitions that are becoming popular probes for studying high redshift galaxies as a result of the advent of ALMA high frequency performance (Bands 8, 9, & 10). While they are commonly used as tracers of cold gas and SFR, they both arise in relative low density ionized gas in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies and are subject o complications due to variations in radiation field, metallicity, ionization, and gas accretion/ejection. The physical properties gas emitting these FIR lines are even less well understood. We propose to a high resolution, deep imaging study of 3 strongly lensed dusty star forming galaxies at z=2-3 with the requisite spatial information and probe the physical and kinematic properies of the gas emitting the bulk of the [C II] and [N II] lines.',\n"," 'Testing the high-z main-sequence paradigm with ALMA : from disk instability to clumps, bulge formation and quenching. Evidence has emerged that galaxy-internal processes such as disk instabilities in gas-rich star-forming galaxies play an important role in the early evolution of massive galaxies. We propose to constrain these processes with deep, spatially resolved ALMA CO and [CI] observations of BX610, a \"normal\" massive (~1e11 Msun) main-sequence z=2.21 disk galaxy with prominent star-forming clumps and a massive stellar bulge. We will study the cold gas distribution and kinematics for BX610, whose stellar and ionized gas structure/kinematics have been well determined from 0.2\" resolution VLT and HST data. The deep CO (4-3) and [CI](1-0) observations will explore the relation between the gas mass and star formation activity on 1-kpc scales across the disk to investigate the star formation process at z~2 on clump scales. Kinematic analysis of the resolved structures will help to constrain the origin of the clumps, and test the disk instability paradigm that may explain the observed disk galaxies at high-z and the formation of bulges that could transform galaxies into quiescence.',\n"," 'Dust Polarization in Young Protostellar Disks: Constraints on Dust Grain Growth. We propose a multi-wavelength dust polarization study of three young protostellar systems in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. These protostars have large, bright disks that show signatures of dust scattering from previous Cycle 3 polarization observations in Band 6. We will observe the disks at resolutions of ~ 0.25 arcsec (~30 au) in dust polarization in each of Band 7, Band 5, and Band 4. With these observations, we will resolve the polarization structure of each disk over multiple beams. The multiple wavelengths are key to trace different dust grain sizes in the disk and different optical depths. We will use models of dust scattering and grain alignment to characterize the polarization signatures and to constrain the dust grain sizes in these young disks. Grain growth in disks is an important question for disk evolution and planet formation, but it is not well understood. Dust scattering offers an unique opportunity to constrain grain sizes robustly. We will apply this method to a sample of young disks and compare these results to previous techniques.',\n"," 'The Eris-Dysnomia system: the key to understanding planet formation. The classical theory of slow pairwise accretion has been used for more than 40 years to explain the formation of planetesimals.Recent developments, however, have suggested that large bodies instead form directly from gravitational collapse after concentration in turbulent eddies or in streaming instabilities. Unfortunately,observational tests for distinguishing these possibilities have been ambiguous. Here we propose observations which could directly show that Eris, the most massive known dwarf planet, formed promptly through gravitational collapse. The key to this observation is measuring the density of Eris satellite Dysnomia. Measuring the size of Dysnomia is now a straightforward ALMA observation. Measuring the mass is possible through a carefully designed program to make precise measurements of the reflex motion of Eris as Dysnomia orbits it. ALMA is uniquely capable of the providing the measurements required. With these quick observations we have the potential to answer one of the most fundamental modern questions about the early stages of planet formation, with applicability to planetary systems throughout the universe.',\n"," 'A Complete Continuum Imaging Survey of Strongly-Lensed, High-Redshift Starbursts. From the South Pole Telescopes 2500 sq. degree survey of the southern sky, we have constructed a catalog of 81 strongly lensed high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). These sources were selected at 1.4 mm and have complete APEX/LABOCA, Herschel/SPIRE, PACS, and Spitzer/IRAC imaging, and ALMA 3mm spectroscopy. ALMA has already measured the spectroscopic redshifts for nearly all of these sources. ALMA high resolution 870 micron images have allowed the creation of reliable lens models for slightly over half of the sample. These lens models provide a wealth of information about the background source, including the magnifications and intrinsic source properties. This proposal represents the completion of this source catalog by requesting 870 micron imaging for the final 16 sources. In order to decrease the overhead fractions, we include an additional 23 sources as fillers, which will benefit from higher resolution imaging. This adds 40 min of on-source time without additional overheads, bringing the total request time to 3.58 hours. The completion of this catalog will provide a window into the nature of DSFGs and be an invaluable source for the broader ALMA community.',\n"," 'Understanding disk substructures: relating the inner and outer parts of protoplanetary disks. We propose to observe 33 protoplanetary disks around nearby (<200 pc) young stars that have been fully characterized with high-resolution spectroscopy, from the ultraviolet to the infrared, as part of the HST/ULLYSES and VLT/PENELLOPE large programs. Our primary goal is to detect disk structures in the ALMA continuum in order to unveil their origin by comparing their morphology with the properties of the inner disk (mass accretion rates, winds/outflows) estimated from their spectra, critically testing different disk evolution models. The addition of ALMA to this multi-wavelength, multi-technique observational effort will provide a holistic view of the inner and outer disk in order to obtain, for the first time, observational evidence that links dust structures to inner disk properties for a significantly large well-characterized sample of young stars in different star-forming regions. This comprehensive dataset can then be used as a benchmark sample in population studies. The data obtained from this proposal will be immediable available to the community.',\n"," 'The Molecular Gas Content in the NGC 5044 Group. The NGC 5044 group is the best candidate for studying star formation in an AGN-perturbed cooling flow due to its proximity and extensive multi-frequency coverage. Our ALMA cycle 0 observation of N5044 in CO(2-1) detected 24 molecular structures. Based on the molecular masses and CO linewidths, these structures are probably giant molecular associations and not individual GMCs. In cycle 4, we successfully proposed for higher spatial resolution observations with the primary goal of resolving these structures into individual GMCs and obtaining the first statistical sample of GMCs that condensed out of a cooling flow. While our previous ALMA observations have been very informative regarding the properties of compact molecular structures in cooling flows, the majority of the molecular gas (~70%), as measured by an IRAM 30m obervation, remains unaccounted for in the ALMA 12m array data. We therefore propose for a 7m array observation in CO(2-1) to probe the more extended and diffuse component of molecular gas. The distribution and kinematics of this dominant molecular component is essential for a full understanding of the formation of molecular gas in cooling flows.',\n"," 'Mapping the ISM in absorption-selected galaxies at high resolution. A key priority of absorption-line research has been to identify and study the galaxies presumed to host the gas dissected in absorption. Despite decades of sustained effort, only a very small fraction of damped Ly-alpha systems (DLAs; defined by HI column densities representative of galactic discs) have been connected to visible galaxies. And, until recently, none have had observations of their molecular gas recorded in emission. In previous Cycles, we have made the first detections of the CO emission from six DLAs at redshifts z=0.1 to 0.8. These data imply remarkably large molecular gas masses (MH2~4x10^9 to 8x10^10) and high molecular gas fraction (f=0.3 to 0.9). The spatial resolution of these data is however very low (20kpc). Here, we request time to map the CO (4-3) emission from 3 of our most gas-rich DLA galaxies at ~kpc resolution to properly dissect the galaxies gas dynamics and study whether the bulk of the gas is in ordered disks or in extended haloes. Furthermore, the comparison between the flux in different CO transitions will allow us test whether the ISM conditions are comparable to that of MW-type galaxies, or whether the CO lines are closer to being thermalised.',\n"," 'A Comprehensive [CII] Survey of Herschel-Selected Starbursts at z=3-6. Based on a survey of the most luminous massive starburst galaxies found in >1000deg2 observed with Herschel, we have obtained a comprehensive sample of nearly 100 sources with secure, CO/CI-based spectroscopic redshifts. Here we propose to detect [CII] 158um emission from the star-forming ISM at z=3-6 in all 33 galaxies in our sample that are observable with the ACA, i.e., twice as many as in the largest massive starburst samples currently available. In combination with the rich suite of diagnostics already available, this study will provide critical insight into the physical properties of the ISM that set the conditions for star formation for a statistically significant sample, including a study of feedback based on the line profiles. Based on 9 systems in our sample for which we have already obtained <=1kpc resolution [CII] imaging with the ALMA 12m array, the ACA data will also provide a critical test for the potential presence of low surface brightness emission on >5-10kpc scales due to an enriched cold circum-galactic medium missed by high-resolution studies, as has been suggested to be present in star-forming galaxies in the early universe by some recent theoretical work.',\n"," 'Validating the L850-MH2 calibration with Herschel-ATLAS galaxies up to z~0.4 (resubmission). Disentangling the physical processes contributing to the decline in the cosmic star formation rate requires the measurement of the interstellar gas content of galaxies out to high redshift, but CO line observations are difficult and time-consuming. The development of a calibration between the dust continuum luminosity at 350 GHz (lambda = 850um) and the molecular gas content provides a more efficient method to infer the gas mass of high redshift galaxies, yet current measurements of the Lv850/MH2 ratio rely on small galaxy samples. How this ratio varies with other galaxy properties remains unknown. We thus propose to use 3.9 hrs of ALMA Band-6 and Band-7 to observe the dust continuum at 350 GHz to an rms of 0.2 mJy/beam, simultaneously tracing the CO(J=3-2) line at 346 GHz, for 34 galaxies selected from the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS). With this large sample, we will (i) confirm the Lv850/MH2 ratio found in previous studies, (ii) identify any physical properties affecting the shape or scatter in the calibration, and (iii) provide to the community a robust calibration to apply to higher redshift observations.

Detecting galaxies from the local to the highest redshift Universe, including the epoch of cosmic reionization at z >6, and characterizing their star formation activities and physical properties are obviously a key issue to understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies as well as disentangling the relationship between the diverse populations of galaxies. While star formation and dynamics of low-z galaxies have been well studied using the CO lines as a tracer, those of high-z galaxies have not due to their faintness.Meanwhile, the ionized carbon 158 micron [CII]line can be a powerful alternative to detect high-z galaxies, because it is the strongest cooling line of interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies and observable at submm/mm when redshifted to z >6. The ALMA can detect high-z [CII]line only in a few hours and resolve galaxies in this line emission on a few kpc scales, enabling to probe obscured star formation and constrain sizes, dynamical masses and physical properties of ISM in early star-forming galaxies at the epoch of reionization for the first time.Here, we propose the ALMA [CII]line observation of star-forming galaxies at z >6. We particularly propose to target three galaxies at z=6.96, 7.109 and 7.215 discovered to date, because they are spectroscopically confirmed highest-class redshift objects in the epoch of reionization and we have a lot of information about these galaxies that can be compared with the ALMA observations. Using them as probes, we will (1) reveal the relation between high-z and local star-forming galaxies, (2) estimate obscured SFRs and state of reionization at z~7-7.2, (3) investigate the morphology, dynamics and physical properties of z~7-7.2 galaxies, and (4) to constrain the physical states of ISM in z~7-7.2 galaxies.',\n"," 'CO excitation and star-formation in gas-selected galaxies from z=0.5 to z=2.6. Damped Lyman alpha galaxies trace the dominant reservoirs of neutral hydrogen gas throughout cosmic history. Studies from UV, optical and near-IR emission have revealed rather low levels of star-formation activity at the respective redshifts. Surprisingly, targeting DLA systems with ALMA, we have found that a high fraction of the DLA-selected galaxies also have significant amounts of molecular gas similar to their stellar masses. Current understanding of the role of these absorption selected galaxies in the context of galaxy evolution is severely limited, and we need to determine the physical nature of the molecular gas, and its connection to the star-formation activity in these systems. In order to constrain the state of the molecular gas we here propose to target 6 DLA galaxies with high CO luminosities. With the proposed observatons, we will measure CO in a range of spectral-line transitions from CO(J=2-1) through to CO(J=7-6), with which we will determine the excitation state, density and temperature of the gas. Individual CO lines and their ratios are needed to measure hidden star-formation, and star-formation surface densities.',\n"," 'G0.253+0.016: A dense Galactic Center Cloud with low Star Formation Potential. We wish to study the temperature structure and the reservoir of dense gas in the Galactic Center molecular cloud G0.253+0.016. This is a cloud with unique physical properties: single-dish dust emission data indicates an enormous density (2x10^5 M_sun within 3 pc radius), but the cloud is essentially devoid of signposts for star formation (i.e., IR sources, Hii regions, masers). SMA and CARMA data (submitted to ApJ) reveal that very few cores of very dense gas exist in the cloud. The requested ALMA data form part of a long-term systematic study of the Central Molecular Zone. The main aim of the current proposal is to probe the clouds temperature structure. Line ratios indicate gas temperatures ~80K, but dust emission suggests values <30K. This difference is surprising, since the coupling of dust and gas temperatures should be efficient at the high observed densities. The high gas temperature may suppress fragmentation and therefore star formation. Given cooling times of a few 10^4 yr, the dust-gas temperature difference may hint at heating in a cloud-cloud collision. A secondary goal is to detect dense cores in dust emission. Despite relatively high sensitivity, the SMA was so far unable to detect such cores. The requested ALMA data will be more sensitive by a factor 20, and will thus help to constrain the density structure very well.',\n"," 'Disk Masses and Dust Grain Growth in Class I Protostars in Ophiuchus. Recent studies suggest that protoplanetary disks around 1-5 Myr old pre-main sequence stars contain insufficient mass to form giant planets. This may be because by this stage much of the material in the disk has already grown into larger bodies, hiding the material from sight. To test this hypothesis, we propose to observe a diverse sample of protostars in Ophiuchus younger than 1 Myr, whose disks are more likely to represent the initial mass budget of protoplanetary disks for forming planets. We will measure the mass of the disks around these protostars, constrain the maximum dust grain sizes in the disks, determine the geometry of the circumstellar material of these systems, and trace Keplerian rotation in the disks to measure the masses of the central protostars. By comparing the disk mass distribution and maximum dust grain sizes we derive for our sample with the existing 1-5 Myr old disk sample we will constrain the initial mass budget for forming planets in protoplanetary disks. We submitted a complementary proposal to repeat the experiment in Taurus but kept the proposals separate as they explore different star forming regions and are each self contained.',\n"," 'Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE). We have initiated the largest ever survey of red giant SiO masers in the Galactic bulge and inner Galaxy. At the 43 GHz and 86 GHz frequencies of the SiO maser we are not hindered by extinction, and accurate stellar velocities (<1 km/s) and positions are obtained with minimal observing time. The detection of up to ~35,000 red giant SiO maser sources will yield numbers comparable to optical surveys, but with the additional strength of a much more thorough coverage of the highly obscured inner Galaxy. The number of sources will be large enough to trace complex structures and minority populations. The velocity structure of these tracers is to be compared with the kinematic structures seen in gas, complex orbit structure in the bar, or stellar streams resulting from infallen systems. Modeling of the bar and bulge dynamics will be done using the new kinematic information in the inner Galaxy region. Our survey will also yield luminous SiO masers suitable for orbit and parallax determination using VLBI. We are successfully observing with our calibration scheme using the VLA at 43 GHz; we here propose to demonstrate its feasibility with ALMA in the southern sky at 86 GHz.',\n"," 'The role of the environment in shaping the CMF in the L1641 Molecular Clouds. We propose to use the C40-1 12-m array configuration in band 3 to observe 12 pre-stellar cores across the L1641 molecular clouds to derive their physical properties with regards to their local environment. Specifically we want to determine whether their formation and subsequent evolution on a filament or in the field affects the ongoing star formation process therein in any way. We will use the HCO and H13CO+ J=1-0 emission line to detect the infall motions within the cores as well as those from the local environment onto the cores and study any variations in the infall rate. We will further use the SiO (J=2-1) emission line to look for outflows towards these cores, indicative of very young proto-stellar sources and to fully characterise along with the infall motions the internal structure and dynamics the cores. We will further use the NH2D to trace the denset regions of the cores and derive their temperature and column density while the continuum emission will allow us to study the fragmentation level of the cores.',\n"," 'To launch or not: A study of magnetic fields in post-AGB objects with and without massive outflows. The study of magnetic fields in evolved stars is crucial for understanding the extreme departures from spherical symmetry that occur in the late stages of stellar evolution. Indeed the fields ability to launch and collimate the bipolar jets believed to be involved in the shaping of the envelopes of post-AGB (pAGB) objects is a matter of intense debate. But the observational study of magnetic fields so far is very limited. We therefore propose to use ALMA and its new full continuum polarization capability to study magnetic fields through observations of linear polarization of dust grain emission, in two well-studied pAGB objects. These are OH231.8+4.2 and the Red Rectangle, with the former showing a massive outflow and the latter a very weak one. The high-resolution ALMA data will allow us to detect and map the field at small scales and test the outflow-launching mechanism in each object.',\n"," 'Molecular budget of AGN discs and outflows. We propose to map with ACA 7m array the CO emission in a sample of local AGN host galaxies in order to obtain a reliable overview of the molecular gas distribution and kinematics on kpc-scales. The sample is drawn from a parent sample of 60 hard X-ray selected local AGN from the INTEGRAL IBIS AGN catalog. The 8 selected targets have ALMA 12m array data probing low J CO in the central few kpc, and MUSE/SINFONI@VLT data probing the ionised and warm molecular phase in their discs and NLR. With this proposal we aim at investigating specifically the cold molecular gas distribution over the kpc-scales that were filtered-out by the 12m array. We aim at a) deriving the total mass in the discs and outflows, and assess the cold gas kinematics out to 10-15 kpc scales, a region comparable to the MUSE field of view; and (b) deriving the spatial distribution of the gas fraction, joining ACA and ALMA 12m CO data and the stellar mass distribution derived from optical and NIR imaging. This we will allow us to obtain a comprehensive overview of the cold gas phase, its distribution and kinematics, to probe the AGN-galaxy interaction and scaling relations over different physical scales.',\n"," 'Unravelling the dust formation process in oxygen-rich AGB stars. As of today, the mechanism triggering the onset of the stellar wind and mass-loss rate in O-rich AGB stars is not yet understood: (1) We still do not know which are the first little dust seeds formed. (2) Launching a wind seems only possible when the grains are already quite large close to the star. (3) It has been hypothesized that the primary dust species in low and high mass-loss rate AGB stars are different. With ALMA, it is possible for the first time to get decisive information on the chemical processes, dynamics, and geometrical structure in the dust forming region of O-rich AGB stars. With ALMA band 7 in extended configuration, we can spatially resolve the dust forming region in 2 cornerstone O-rich AGB stars, being the best representatives for low and high mass-loss rate AGB stars: R Dor and IK Tau. By observing key molecular species contributing to the formation of dust grains (MgO, MgOH, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2, SiO, H2O, CaOH, NaCl, FeO, and MgS), we will be able to answer key questions on the efficiency of gas depletion by condensing onto dust grains, the dynamical structure in the dust forming region and the spatial correlation between the gas and dust species.',\n"," 'Forming giant planets: the initial conditions. We propose a comprehensive program to determine the structure of the outer region (> 20 AU) of protoplanetary disks around young A-type stars. The primary goal is to measure the gas and dust surface density structure. In turn, this will provide the radial variation of the gas-to-dust ratio as well as the total gas mass. This information is fundamental to understand the initial conditions of gas giant planet formation and make the link with directly imaged exoplanets around A-type stars. Despite its importance, we still do not know the total amount of the gas reservoir available to form planets in disks. Thanks to ALMA we can now use the faint, optically thin, emission of the rare CO isotopologues to address the gas reservoir and its radial distribution. We have selected a sample of nearby, isolated disks for which we have collected a large multi-wavelength data set that will complement the ALMA images. This program will have a legacy value for the whole community providing a unique benchmark for detailed disk modelling.',\n"," 'Mapping the youngest pulsar wind nebula in the Galaxy. Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are Natures best particle acceleration laboratories. Young pulsars and young PWNe are very dynamic and can show evolutionary effects on timescales of a few years. Most young PWNe have been discovered and studied in X-rays, where the fluxes and spectral parameters of distinct jet and torus structures constrain the properties of the highly-relativistic pulsar wind particles, the acceleration mechanisms, and the geometry of the pulsar. Mm observations of PWNe can provide additional constraints, e.g., on the energy spectrum of the injected pulsar wind particles. The PWN in the supernova remnant Kes 75 was recently confirmed to be the youngest PWN in the Galaxy (380-520 years, Reynolds et al 2018). This PWN provides an unique opportunity to study the early evolution of a PWN and its powering pulsar. The PWN shows distinct small-scale (<10 arcsec) features in X-rays, e.g., jets. Different PWN regions have different X-ray spectral properties. We propose ALMA observations at a similar spatial resolution as the existing X-ray data in order to study the small-scale PWN morphology in the mm, and to constrain and compare their spectral properties in X-rays and mm.',\n"," 'Measuring an Emprical Temperature Structure for the HD 163296 Disk. Gas surface density and temperature profiles are among the most fundamental properties of a protoplanetary disk. These profiles regulate almost all observable characteristics of the disk, and therefore their accurate characterization has long been a goal of both disk observations and theory. In particular, poorly constrained parametric temperature structures are currently proving to be insufficient for interpretation of ALMA data, limiting progress on constraining disk properties such as turbulence. Observations of optically thick lines can break the degeneracies of parametric temperature structures, directly yielding the radial temperature profile of their emission surface layer. Furthermore, in an inclined disk these observations can be used to probe in the vertical direction, with a directly observable opening angle for each emission surface. We propose to exploit these properties and constrain the 2-D (radial and vertical) temperature structure of the HD 163296 disk by observing multiple transitions of optically thick CO isotopologues. Our results will provide the first fully empirical temperature structure for a protoplanetary disk.',\n"," 'Zooming in on the parsec-scale structure of CO gas at low metallicity and its relation to star formation. The star formation rate is proportional to the surface density of molecular gas, for a wide range of metallicities. Models predict that the structure of CO-emitting gas should change with metallicity and radiation field: extended CO emission and CO \"clumps\" should shrink as metallicity decreases or radiation field strength increases. This effect has never been directly observed before, and models of CO formation have not been put to a test. Additionally, the effects of those changes on the star formation process, which occurs in dense, CO-emitting gas, are unknown. We propose to obtain deep maps of two transitions (1-0 and 2-1) of three CO isotopes (12CO, 13CO, and C18O) in 6 regions of two low-metallicity galaxies, the LMC and the SMC. These observations will allow us to test CO photo-chemical models by providing deep maps of the pc-scale structure, column density, thermal, and chemical state of the CO-emitting gas at two low metallicities and a range of radiation fields. By comparing the CO maps to pc-resolution tracers of star formation, specifically 24 micron emission and young stellar objects, we will bridge the gap between Galactic and extragalactic star formation studies',\n"," 'Diffuse cold atomic gas in Seyfert galaxies: to reveal multi-phase nature of AGN obscuration. Recent high resolution observations of both dense molecular and diffuse atomic gas in the Circinus galaxy showed consistent physical/dynamical properties to what expected in the multi-phase fountain torus model, which may explain the physical origin of AGN tori. As an international collaboration of AGN researchers (GATOS), we here propose high resolution (0.1\" ~ 10 pc) [CI](1-0) observations toward 2 nearby Seyfert galaxies to test the fountain model in a wider parameter space. Importantly, we already have the same resolution CO(3-2) data of these objects, allowing us to study the multi-phase nature of the tori straightforwardly. With this short time program, we will investigate the density structure of the tori, as well as the existence of atomic outflows (a key process to maintain the fountain torus structure): our dedicated simulations will be useful for these purposes. We can also study the intriguing dependence of the toruss geometrical structure on an Eddington ratio, which was suggested by recent hard X-ray surveys.',\n"," 'ACA Monitoring of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) targets during the April 2020 EHT Campaign. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration (EHTC) is requesting observations of several sources in Cycle 7, with the aim of resolving black hole shadows and jet launching regions in AGN. These are expected to be observed over a 2-week window in April 2020, using several ~5-15 hr observing runs, triggered based on weather and telescope readiness, i.e. individual sources will be observed over several days with unpredictable gaps in daily coverage. Here we propose daily ACA monitoring of four key EHTC-proposed sources: SgrA*, M87, 3C279, and OJ287 - during the EHT campaign. The primary goals of this proposal are to obtain: (a) better than 10% absolute flux calibration (per daily epoch) for all sources in the EHT observing runs (via bootstrapping); (b) constrain the origin of variability (e.g., proper motions vs relative brightening of individual components, or hot-spot orbits in Sgr A*) seen in EHT images on individual days; (c) a better comparison with the multi-wavelength (cm to X-ray) campaign. Overall, these observations will lead to a significantly better, and perhaps crucial, understanding of the physical mechanisms leading to variability on event horizon scales.',\n"," 'Cometary out-gassing or icy planetesimal collision in a young debris disk?. There is a pivotal point in the lifetime of circumstellar disks at the 5-10 Myr mark: the transition between gas-rich proto-planetary disks towards gas-poor debris disks. It is thought that planets must be formed before (giant planets) or shortly after (rocky planets) this critical phase, and yet the details of how this transition proceeds is poorly constrained. A key observable to better understand this short-lived phase is the detection and characterization of gas in young debris disks, as we can learn about the formation and evolution of icy planetesimals and cometary bodies. We detected the CO 6-5 emission line in the 10 Myr old debris disk around HR4796, using APEX. This unique high transition detection for a debris disk is even more interesting as the line appears blue-shifted without a red counter-part, suggesting an asymmetric distribution of the gas. We propose ALMA Band 9 observations (C40-3), as the unmatched spatial resolution will enable us to constrain the kinematics of the gas. With these new observations, we could reveal on-going cometary out-gassing in the inner regions of the disk, or collisions of icy planetesimals in the debris disk at about 1\".',\n"," 'Characterizing the Atmosphere and Surface of Triton with ALMA. Triton possesses one of two known micro-bar class atmospheres in our Solar System, with the other belonging to Pluto. Both atmospheres are dominated by N2 in vapor equilibrium with surface ices, with trace amounts of CH4 and CO. Our Cycle 2 ALMA observations of Plutos atmosphere were quite successful: we detected strong CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3), allowing characterization of the atmosphere in ways that the New Horizons mission could not (neither species was observable by NH). We now propose to obtain comparitive data for Triton, by conducting a sensitive search for CO(3-2) and HCN(4-3) in its atmosphere. From our observations we will i) determine the column abundance of CO to 20%, a factor of 15 better than determined in the near-IR, providing insight into the nature of atmosphere-surface interaction and the maintenance of the atmosphere over time ii) search for HCN, which if detected provides a crucial constraint for understanding Tritons atmospheric photochemistry and microphysics, thermal balance, and volatile escape rates. ALMA is the only facility that can perform the observations necessary to characterize the atmosphere of Triton.',\n"," 'Hidden in plain sight: dynamical mass estimates for a newly-discovered red monster at zspec~5.6 in the GOODS-S field. A surprising result of early JWST observations was the discovery of several extremely massive galaxies up to z~8 challenging the standard LCDM model. However, the lack of spectroscopic redshifts and inherent uncertainties of SED fitting sparked a debate about a possible overestimation of stellar masses. The only way to resolve this tension is dynamical masses. Here, we propose to do exactly this for an even more extreme galaxy at zspec=5.58 discovered in deep JWST images and spectra. It is extremely red and massive - almost Milky Way mass already at 1Gyr after the Big Bang - and has a very extended dust distribution (ALMA 1.1mm size ~6 kpc). This monster was hiding in plain sight in the GOODS-S field. Despite 30 years of observations, it was only now revealed thanks to ALMA and JWST. We propose partially resolved [CII]158um emission line observations: the most efficient approach to obtain its dynamical mass, total star formation rate, and gas distribution. This is the only way to test its overly massive nature within LCDM, study the formation of such extended dust (and/or gas) distributions, and understand the formation of extreme sources in the first 1Gyr of the Universe.',\n"," 'Molecular gas content of massive star-forming galaxies in a galaxy cluster at z=1.46. We propose Band-3 observations targeting CO(2-1) emissions from [OII]-selected massive star-forming galaxies in a z=1.46 galaxy cluster to investigate molecular gas content of the galaxies. The location where our targets inhabit implies that they are probably progenitors of the present-day massive galaxies in galaxy clusters. Interestingly, the galaxies are growing with star formation activity and still in intense evolutionary phase. Thus, the galaxies are one of the best targets to discuss how the cluster galaxies evolved and acquired the characteristic properties such as less star-formation activity and bulge-dominated morphology. We focus on gas reservoir, depletion timescale of molecular gas and efficiency of star formation. We compare the gas properties in the cluster galaxies with those in the field galaxies, and identify what is a key process governing the evolution of cluster galaxies. Note that even if CO emission lines are not detected from our targets, the proposed observations are deep enough for us to conclude that the cluster galaxies at z=1.46 contain less amount of molecular gas at a given stellar mass compared to field galaxies at similar redshifts.',\n"," 'Directly measuring the progression of infall from the envelope to the disk-forming region of BHR 71. Infall transforms dense cores into protostars. During the embedded phase of star formation, the evolution of infall determines the final mass of the central protostar as well as the initial condition of the disk and planet formation. Theoretical studies still debate about the types of infall, the \"inside-out\" or \"outside-in\" fashions, and the effects of rotation and magnetic fields; only few direct observation of infall exists to constrain the infall process. Previously, we have detected an unambiguous signature of infall, toward an embedded protostar, BHR 71, and modeled the infall kinematics. To trace the progression of infall, we propose here to measure the radial variation of infall toward BHR 71 via multiple transitions of HCO+, empirically probing the infall at different radii, and the resolved emission of complex organic molecules (COMs), tracing the kinematics close to the disk. We will trace the kinematics from the envelope (~1000 au) to the disk-forming region (~30 au), identifying the type of infall and probing the transition from infall to rotation. Furthermore, we will survey the high frequency emission of COMs to complement the previous discovery of COMs.',\n"," 'Resolving dust continuum in intrinsically-faint H-dropout ALMA galaxies behind lensing clusters. We propose to obtain ~0.2 arcsec resolution 1.2 mm dust-continuum images of five lensed (intrinsically faint) NIR-dark ALMA galaxies at z = 2 5. Recent ALMA deep observations uncover faint (sub)mm-selected galaxies and a fraction of them are known to be invisible even in the deepest HST/WFC3 (and even JWST/NIRCam) near-infrared images (i.e., H-band dropouts), but their nature remains elusive partly because their faintness hampers any further spectroscopic and high-resolution follow-up observations. The proposed sources are apparently bright thanks to significant magnification (mu = 5 9) and therefore provide ideal laboratory to investigate physical properties of intrinsically-faint dust-obscured galaxies. We will directly measure the sizes of dust emission to test the proposed scenarios on the origin(s) of near-infrared darkness, i.e., the compactness of dust and stellar distributions or disk inclination (i.e., galaxies seen in edge-on). Preliminary dust source size measurements of reconstructed source plane images using ~1 arcsec images already suggest a diversity of physical cause. Confirming it by ~0.2 arcsec resolution observations of more sources will be a logical step.',\n"," 'Revealing the Physical Properties of Molecular Gas Associated with the Magellanic SNR N132D. In supernova remnants (SNRs), the interaction between the shock waves and the ambient interstellar gas is an essential process which affects evolution, high-energy emission, and relativistic particle acceleration. Therefore, it is important to study the detailed physical properties of the interaction between SNRs and interstellar gas, in order to understand the underlying processes. N132D is the brightest SNR in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and is thought to be associated with the molecular clouds. Most recently, we found the interacting molecular gas by using the Mopra 12CO(J=1-0) dataset. However, we could not reveal the detailed structures and the physical conditions. We propose to observe N132D and its surroundings with 12CO(J=1-0) line emission by ALMA and to determine the physical properties of molecular clouds interacting with the shock waves. ALMAs sensitivity and spatial resolution will allow us to study in detail the CO gas interacting with the \"extragalactic SNR\" for the first time.',\n"," 'Probing the magnetic field towards a massive dense core in the potential well of a hub-filament system. There is a growing evidence of the role of hub-filament systems in the formation of high-mass stars. These systems are believed to provide the fast accretion rates and the internal turbulent support needed for the massive dense prestellar cores to accrete a large fraction of their mass before the feedback from the central protostars disperse the surrounding material. However, the formation and evolution of these systems at the early prestellar phase are still unexplored. Especially the strength of the magnetic field in dense cores (densities >10^7cm-3) is not constrained observationally. We propose ALMA (cycle 7) 3mm full polarization observations to measure the Zeeman splitting of the hyperfine transitions of the CN(1-0) to derive the magnetic field intensity of one of the most extreme massive dense prestellar core sitting in the centre of a hub threaded by multiple filaments. With these observations we seek to measure the Zeeman effect to derive the magnetic field strength and study the role of the magnetic field and its interplay with turbulence and gravity in the formation and evolution of such massive, cold, and dense prestellar cores, the progenitors of high-mass stars.',\n"," 'Imaging a unique massive binary BH candidate in OJ287 with the EHT+ALMA. We propose 1 mm EHT+ALMA observations of the BL Lac object OJ287, one of the best candidates for hosting a binary SMBH and to study jet formation in magnetically dominated AGN. The improvement in the north-south resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA and the comparison with quasi-simultaneous, resolution-matched 3 mm GMVA+ALMA and 1.3 cm space-VLBI RadioAstron images will allow us to perform Faraday rotation synthesis and opacity analysis approaching linear scales of 26 Rs. Comparison with a similar campaign performed in spring 2017 will allow us, for the first time, to study the time evolution of the innermost jet structure, magnetic field strength and 3D structure, accretion flow, and non-thermal particle population at scales not probed before in an AGN jet. This information will be used to test jet formation models and the uniqueness of the binary SMBH interpretation by comparing to general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion disks that might provide a competing model to OJ287. The proposed EHT+ALMA observations promise for the first time to directly reveal the nature of such elusive binary systems.',\n"," 'High resolution ALMA imaging of gas and dust in low-z gas rich galaxies (resubmission). One of the most striking differences between the nearby and high-z star-formation activity is the presence of giant molecular clumps in gas-rich disk-galaxies which can be as 100-1000x more massive than those seen locally. Is it therefore crucial to understand the dynamical processes that give birth to those high-z gas-rich and highly turbulent disks. From our previous experiments, we have identified three gas-rich galaxies, f_gas=MH2/(MH2+Mstar)>0.3 at z~0.1-0.2, which could be perfect laboratories to understand the star-forming physics seen in gas rich galaxies at z>1. As a follow-up campaign, we propose to target these three bright, gas-rich galaxies to resolve at 0.2\" resolution (sub-kpc-scale rest-frame) the detailed spatial distribution of the 850 micron dust continuum and 12CO(3-2) line, in order to examine the dynamics of these recently discovered galaxies at z~0.1-0.2. At the exquisite signal-to-noise provided by their nearby nature, we can put tight constraints on the internal properties of these galaxies, including Larsons relations, the Kennicutt-Schimdt law and the L850-MH2 calibration for the different molecular gas regions.

We propose to follow-up our Cycle 1 (delivered in Cycle 2) observations to fully trace the 3D velocity field of the material accreting onto a newly forming O-star. Our target, W33A, a proto-O-star, is nearby (2.4 kpc) and well studied, already having a rare combination of high resolution observations at near-IR (Gemini-AO- 0.13\") and mid-IR (VLTI-MIDI - 0.04\") plus our Cycle 1 data (~0.3\"). Our ALMA data show a spiral filament feeding material to the central region, where the velocity profile show signs of rotation, suggesting the O-star is forming via a disk. This `disk appears disrupted by infalling streams (we find at one on 1000au scales - Maud et al. 2017 MNRAS 472 120), fragmentation due to gravitational instability, or interaction with companions. However, we have not yet resolved the disk scales <500au of the system to determine which is the case. Our 3D radiative transfer models (dust & gas) including infall from the outer rotating envelope onto a compact system best matches the binary scenario (disk radii <250au). ALMA will reveal the answer, as it is the only instrument that can zoom in and image the sub-100au scales, allowing us to test massive star formation theories.',\n"," 'Imaging Gravitational Instability in the most massive FU Ori object. One of the surprising findings of ALMAs HL Tau observations is the lack of spiral arms and/or clumps, which are the ubiquitous features of gravitational instability (GI). Considering HL Tau is one of the most massive disks, it cast doubts on whether GI ever operates in protoplanetary disks. We propose to look for the signatures of GI in disks which are even more massive than HL Tau. FU Orionis/Exor objects are great candidates to search for GI as most theoretical models imply thay their disks should be unstable. Our ALMA Cycle-2 program has targeted several FU Orionis/EXor objects and we choose the most massive disk, V883 Ori (~0.6 Msun), to obtain high angular resolution data to search for the spiral arms and/or clumps caused by GI. Imaging GI would be a ground-breaking discovery. However, if we not find any signatures of GI in this extremely massive disk, it will put stringent constraints on all current disk outburst models. Whatever the case, our program will be a major contribution to the understanding of the FU Ori phenomenon. At 450 pc, V883 Ori is so bright (360 mJy in band-6) that it can be imaged at 0.034\" (15 AU) resolution in only 1.2 hs.',\n"," 'Further observations of R Aqr. This is a continuation of a successfull project, 2017.1.00363.S, devoted to study the line and continuum emission in the symbiotic stellar system (SS) R Aqr. R Aqr is a prototypical SS, a binary with an AGB star and a white dwarf that show a strong interaction. Our cycle 5 observations show for the first time the flow of material between both stars and the gravitational effects of the secondary on the wind from the AGB: the mass loss is strongly focused in the orbital plane and a double spiral appears. The data are strikingly in agreement with predictions from our preliminary hydrodynamical models. We also detected the birth of the bipolar jets (at scales of some AU!), which extend several arcmin at other wavelengths. However, the attained resolution, 30x40 mas, is hardly enough to detect the crucial phenomena, since the stars are separated by 30-40 mas. Particularly, the flow between both stars requires confirmation from maps with the highest resolution. In addition, a good analysis of the data, both in lines and continuum, requires observations at several wavelengths. We propose to observe also in bands 7 and 9, including data of the continuum and the CO J=2-1 and 6-5 lines.',\n"," 'The cold ISM in nearby analogs of cosmic reionization sources. We propose to measure the molecular gas content in a sample of z~0.3 Lyman continuum emitting galaxies we have recently discovered with the HST. These galaxies are compact, highly star-forming galaxies with strong optical emission lines, which resemble «green peas» and luminous compact galaxies. These rare at low-z galaxies are currently the best nearby analogs of the sources of cosmic reionization. The proposed CO(3-2) observations will inform us for the first time about the molecular gas properties of these unique and extremely interesting sources. We will determine the total molecular gas mass and column density, gas fraction, molecular gas depletion time scales, and aim at constraining kinematics of the cold gas. This will allow us to address key questions on their ISM properties, the gas consumption times, and the feedback processes allowing the escape of ionizing radiation. The properties of the Lyman continuum emitting galaxies will also be compared to those of normal and dwarf galaxies at z~0-3. Our observations will provide important insights for the ISM in these galaxies, and pave the way for understanding how similar galaxies can reionize the Universe at early epochs.',\n"," 'A search for the missing cold dark matter subhalos. We propose to observe three strongly lensed dusty, star forming galaxies (DSFGs) in band 7 to detect low-mass dark matter subhalos by measuring the minute distortions they cause in the lensed images of the background sources. The abundance of low-mass subhalos is a key discriminating prediction of the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, and strong lensing is a unique tool that can test this prediction. We have already made the first detection of a subhalo in ALMA observations of a strong lensing system (SDP.81) and have shown that this dataset is very sensitive to the presence of subhalos down to ~ 2X10^7 M_sun. This uniquely positions ALMA to measure the mass function of dark matter subhalos with unprecedented precision and thereby resolve one of the most important puzzles in modern cosmology.',\n"," 'Molecular abundances in the low-metallicity environment of the Far-Outer Galaxy. The metallicity Z of gas in galaxies increases steadily with time, as stars evolve and progressively release heavy elements into the interstellar medium. Low metallicities characterise the outer regions of our own Galaxy, which can in turn modify the abundances of molecules in the clouds formed here. Very few studies have, however, been dedicated to the investigation of the molecular content of clouds in the outer Galaxy, especially for molecules other than CO. The significant difference in metallicity between the inner and outer Galaxy makes a comparative study of abundances in these two regions of the galactic disk the most promising way of assessing the influence of Z on the chemistry, and will allow to test the predictions of the models for these conditions. Because low metallicities are also typical of dwarf irregulars and higher-redshift galaxies, this will be a first step towards a characterisation of the chemistry in molecular clouds in external galaxies and in the early Universe.',\n"," 'A galaxy on fire: witnessing the initial phase of starburst in the core of a distant cluster?. Being unparalleled in terms of imaging quality and depth compared to competing projects, the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey is the only existing large-scale extragalactic survey capable of delivering large galaxy cluster samples out to z=1.4. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign of the HSC cluster sample at z>1, we have fortuitously discovered a blue ring encircling a red galaxy, located at the center of a low mass cluster. Using archival and our own optical spectroscopic data, we have established that both the ring, its central galaxy, and two neighboring galaxies are all at the same redshift, z=1.06. Furthermore, the galaxy trio is strongly detected in archival Spitzer and Herschel data, indicating a star formation rate of 200 Msun/yr. It appears that the cluster center is experiencing an intense episode of star formation. We propose to conduct CO(2-1) transition observation of the cluster, to (1) measure the gas kinematics of the ring system, and (2) measure the total molecular gas content in the cluster center. The data will allow us to uncover the origin of the star forming ring, and the star formation activity in the core of this cluster.',\n"," 'The role of cosmic rays regulating star formation in AGN. The giant radio-galaxy 3C326N is perhaps one of the best examples of negative AGN feedback. With 2e9 Msun of molecular gas, its SFR is only <0.07 Msun/yr, 20 times lower than what is expected from the Kennicutt law. Why is star formation suppressed? Outflows and turbulence are possible culprits, but the role of cosmic rays (CR) has been neglected, because we lack constraints on the CR flux. However, they could play a major role by heating the molecular gas, controlling its ionization state, and driving outflows, which could regulate star formation. To test those hypothesis, we propose to map with ALMA the CO(1-0) and [CI]609um lines in 3C326N. Our models show that the CO/[CI] line ratio is a sensitive diagnostic of the CR ionization rate. We will search for a CR-driven outflow by looking at spatial variations of the CO/[CI] ratio. If CRs turn out to be an important source of ionization and heating of the H2 gas, they could provide a universal, and so far ignored, mechanism for AGN feedback. The AGN physics explored here will greatly enhance our understanding of why 3C326N, and massive early-type galaxies in general, have large masses of molecular gas but yet weak star formation.',\n"," 'Detecting the Full Range of z~4 Galaxies Associated with Damped Ly-alpha Systems. As a continuation of our extremely successful cycle 3, 4 and 5 programs to detect the z~4 galaxies associated with high metallicity damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in [CII] emission, we propose to observe ALL known DLAs between z~4.1 and z~4.5 with an accurate metallcity determination. This will constitute the first such sample at any redshift whereby we will cover a full sample of metallicity unbiased DLAs in order to search for the associated galaxy. This will allow us to: 1) determine the star formation rate (SFR), dust content, and size of the full range of DLAs at a given redshift slice. 2) establish the extent of the HI absorption around z~4 star-forming galaxies. The current sample of galaxies associated with high-metallicity DLAs suggest that they are massive dusty, star-forming galaxies with large extended halos of HI gas. The proposed observations will determine if these statements are valid for the general DLA population as well.',\n"," 'The origin of Argonium (ArH+). ABSTRACT: Among the many hydrides detected in the interstellar medium, the molecular ion ArH+ is uniquely expected to reach observable abundances only in nearly pure atomic hydrogen regions with less than 0.1% H2. Previous observations of ArH+ emission associated with the supernova remnant Cas A and ArH+ absorption along Galactic sightlines toward distant star-forming regions have allowed the identification of ArH+ and the evaluation of its column densities. However, due to the complexity of the velocity structure and the presence of large amounts of H2-bearing gas, information on the intrinsic ArH+ line profile and the in situ abundance of ArH+ cannot be extracted from the data. We propose to observe the ground state ArH+ transition at 617.5 GHz toward the radio loud quasar and bright ALMA calibrator 3C454.3 where there are exceptionally complete observations including optical NaI, KI, CaII absorption along with HI, OH HCO+, CO and many other molecules, tracing the cold and warm gas phases. The proposed observation will allow us to identify in a unique way the conditions under which ArH+ exists in the ISM and which phases of the atomic gas are traced by ArH+.',\n"," 'Resolving the Radio Core of Eta Carinae. Eta Carinae is an LBV star forming part of a high mass binary system. The objective of this project is to map the region that emits at submillimeter wavelengths, in the continuum and in the H30 alpha recombination line, using band 6. The region was observed with ALMA in Cycle 0 but was not resolved, even at the highest frequency (630 GHz, resolution 0.45x0.32 arc sec). The integrated continuum spectrum (between 100 and 630 GHz) is characteristic of a compact HII region that becomes optically thin around 250 GHz and H and He recombination lines showed signatures of departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium. From these observations and assuming a spherical expanding shell with constant electron density and temperature, we were able to determine univocally the radius, shell width, density, temperature, and expansion velocity. The radius of the shell is about 0.2 arc sec, and its width a tenth of this value, which makes it possible to resolve with ALMA in its extended Cycle 4 configuration. Depending of the image of the ionized emitting matter, its origin can be attributed to an LBV ejection episode or to the concentration of shocked matter produced in the wind-wind collision.',\n"," 'A first determination of HC14N/HC15N on Neptune: filling a nitrogen isotopic ratio gap in the middle of our solar system. We propose to observe Neptunes HC15N(J=4-3) emission line along with HCN(J=4-3) and H13CN(J=4-3 simultaneously for the first determination of 14N/15N isotopic ratio in Neptunes atmosphere to constrain the formation and evolution scenario and/or the origin of the stratospheric volatiles. In our solar system, measured 14N/15N values can be grouped as Sun/Jupiter (~440) and comet (~150) group. Since Neptune is located in the middle of Jupiter and the outer solar system, a new measurement of its nitrogen isotopic ratio value will not only fill the gap in our knowledge on the radial variations of isotopic ratio slope but also to constrain the formation process scenario and/or the origin of the stratospheric volatiles.',\n"," 'From the main sequence to the red cloud: linking the molecular cloud lifecycle to galaxy evolution. The molecular cloud lifecycle, the efficiency of star formation and the coupling of feedback to the ISM depend both on local and global conditions, and strongly affect the global evolution of galaxies, from the main sequence to the red cloud. Mapping the molecular gas on the cloud scale across a broad range of environments is a key step to measure these quantities and understand how the local physical processes contribute to regulating star-formation and feedback in galaxies on large scales. We propose to apply the high sensitivity and high angular resolution of ALMA to map the molecular gas disc down to cloud scales in a sample of early-type galaxies, which are in (or have completed) the transition from the main sequence to the red cloud, and study the interplay between small-scale physics and galactic structure. Combined with our previous results on ~20 star-forming main sequence galaxies, we will thus cover the complete evolutionary track of galaxies. This will provide strong constraints on whether galaxy quenching is driven by a cloud-scale inefficiency of star formation or by galaxy-scale processes.',\n"," 'Investigating the evolution of the dwarf disk in XZ Tau B in real time. Using ALMA LBC SV data we imaged, on the edge of the field-of-view, a dwarf transitional disk around the young star XZ Tau B (Osorio et al. 2016). The disk has an outer radius of only 3.4 au and a central cavity of radius 1.3 au. Because of its small size, orbital periods are short and rapid changes are expected in the disk azimuthal structure that could be observable on timescales of just a few months. We requested Cycle 4 observing time to obtain a first-epoch high-quality image of the disk centered on the source. These Cycle 4 observations are scheduled in June 2017. Here we are requesting a second-epoch image in Cycle 5, to be observed in October-November 2017. The two images will be obtained with a difference of 4-5 months, allowing to observe changes in the azimuthal structure of the disk during this time interval. Extrapolation of these results, together with additional monitoring, will provide a robust basis for characterizing the slower evolution of larger disks.',\n"," 'Unveiling the nature of the reddest submillimeter sources in lensing cluster fields. We propose to unveil the nature of very red submm sources discovered in four out of 10 Herschel Lensing Survey (HLS) clusters followed up at 870microns with LABOCA. Undetected in the Herschel bands, these sources may be the first submm selected galaxies with moderate intrinsic luminosities (LFIR<10^12 Lsol) at very high redshifts (z>5) or low luminosity cold dusty galaxies with Td<25K. Measuring their luminosities and redshifts will put important constraints on the density of normal dusty star forming galaxies beyond z=4 and on the fraction of dusty star formation occuring in cold galaxies at lower redshift. Mapping at 1.1mm with a sensitivity of 0.1mJy will allow us to detect these sources with S/N>10 as well as any other lensed galaxy with an intrinsic LFIR>10^11 Lsol up to z=10, and enable us to unambiguously identify their counterparts, estimate their redshift, and constrain their FIR luminosity and dust temperature.

We propose to obtain, using ALMA in both extended and compact configurations, high angular resolution and high imaging quality maps of the CO J=6-5 line emission (rest-frame 691.473 GHz) and the 450 micron continuum of two nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; having LIR>10^11 Lsun): NGC34 (Sy2, D=84 Mpc, 1=407 pc) and NGC1614 (starburst, D=68 Mpc, 1=331 pc). These observations will exploit the best angular resolution (0.23\") that ALMA can achieve in its shortest wavelength band (Band-9) available for the Early Science Call, and will resolve for the first time distributions of warm molecular gas (T>50K) and sub-millimeter dust radiation in LIRGs with spatial resolutions better than 100 pc. NGC34 and NGC1614 have recently been observed by Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) for the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) from J=4-3 to J=13-12. Among 125 LIRGs in the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) that are being observed by Herschel, they are (1) the closest, (2) the brightest in CO(6-5) line flux, (3) with the best Band-9 transmission during the transit, and (4) showing strong nuclear activity. The high spatial and velocity resolutions of our proposed ALMA observations (5.02 hr in total) are crucial in distinguishing different nuclear gas configurations, e.g., outflow or inclined circum-nuclear disks. The ALMA data will allow us to address such important questions as: (i) Is the outflow strong enough to power the warm CO emission now and quench the star formation in future in both LIRGs (one starburst and one AGN)? (ii) Can the hard X-ray irradiation dominate the excitation of the warm CO around an AGN? And how large are the X-ray dominated regions (XDRs)?',\n"," 'High Velocity Masers in the Galactic Center: A New Probe of General Relativity. We propose to conduct a search for high-velocity circumstellar SiO masers close to the Galactic central black hole (Sgr A*). Position and velocity tracking of maser-emitting stars within 0.1 pc of Sgr A* will provide multiple direct probes of the metric (stellar motion plus light propagation) and will enable numerous tests of general relativity not possible with binary pulsars. If SiO maser-emitting stars are identified close to Sgr A*, then the exceptional spatial and spectral resolution of the complete ALMA can test the equivalence principle, the \"no-hair\" theorem of black holes, and frame-dragging. While previous surveys for low-velocity masers have been done, the proposed survey will be 10 times more sensitive and will have 100 times the bandwidth to detect high velocity stars deep in the gravitational potential of the central black hole. Our maser survey requires a single pointing and tuning and only 38 minutes of on-source integration (1.21 hours total). The proposed observations will resolve stellar positions down to 0.01 pc from the central black hole and identify high-velocity stars at distances as small as 0.001 pc.',\n"," 'The home stretch: Completing the redshift catalogue of a large flux-limited high-redshift Herschel sample. We propose to measure with the ACA redshifts of 23 galaxies from the brightest (S500um > 80 mJy) sub-millimeter (submm) galaxies from the Herschel surveys, that will complete our catalogue of robust redshifts for 270 high-redshift Herschel sources, as measured by on-going projects using NOEMA and ALMA and previous ACA programs. These remaining sources are observed most efficiently with the ACA. A complete coverage of this 500um flux-limited sample of 270 bright submm galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts is crucial to draw statistical conclusions, enabling us to determine the role of hyper-luminous (Lfir > 10^13 Lsun) galaxies in cosmic stellar mass assembly, increase the number of known lensed sources at the peak of cosmic evolution (z ~ 2.5), and identify other types of rare objects. Together with existing and ongoing ancillary data in the optical and near-infrared (SALT, NTT, VLT, Keck, Spitzer and HST), this comprehensive sample will provide the baseline for future detailed studies of the brightest galaxies at the peak of cosmic evolution, and will be unique until the next generation of (submm) space telescopes.',\n"," 'Spectral line survey in the rest-frame 350 GHz band toward a lensed sub-mm galaxy at z=2.3. Over the past decade, some unbiased spectral line surveys toward nearby galaxies have been conducted. The target galaxies cover a wide range in star formation activity, nucleus activity, and metallicity. Indeed, these surveys have revealed how chemical composition is sensitive to a specific geature of a galaxy. For instance, our recent line surveys toward the two dwarf galaxies, the LMC and IC10, have revealed characteristic chemical compositionin low-metallicity environments: less abundant nitrogen-bearing species, enhancement of CCH, and deficiency of CH3OH. Such chemical diagnostics of the local galaxies are now developing. However, high-redshift galaxies are still left unexplored from an astrochemical perspective. To overcome situation, we propose a spectral line survey in the rest-frame 350 GHz band toward a lensed sub-millimeter galaxy SMM J2135-0102 (the Cosmic Eyelash) at z=2.326. In our frequency settings, the lines of CCH, CH3OH, HCN, and HCO+ are included. These species are sensitive to UV radiation, cosic ray, and metallicity.

Under the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario, galaxy-galaxy interaction is believed to play an important role in galaxy evolution, changing the galaxy morphology and triggering star-burst and/or AGN. Recent high spatial resolution (tens of pc scale) numerical simulations have found that tidal interaction is responsible for both merger induced gas inflow (nuclear star-burst) and high dispersion gas of dense gas clump surrounded by diffuse gas cloud (widespread star-burst) in the early stage of the interaction. An observational test of the gas response requires mapping both the diffuse and dense gas tracers at high spatial resolution, especially at early stage interaction. Here we propose ALMA Band 3 observation of the CO, HCN, and HCO+ toward the brightest galaxy in our previous OVRO survey catalog of early stage mergers, NGC5331, at 0.4 arcsec (~ 280 pc) resolution. The primary aim of this study is to observationally confirm the gas inflow toward nuclear regions and the clumpy molecular gas structure with high dense gas fraction in the outer disks.

The central question of star formation is how mass is converted from dense cores into stars, or, how the core mass function (CMF) evolves to reproduce the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Lack of robust observational constraints on high-mass star-forming CMF has led to diverse theoretical views. With our recent ALMA project as a proof of concept, we propose mosaic imaging of a massive (1500 Msun/pc) linear filament harbouring a sequence of three evolutionary stages in a roll (prestellar->protostellar->UCHII region). The proposed ALMA 1.3mm image will resolve the entire cloud down to 1000 AU with a mass sensitivity of 0.04Msun, allowing a full sampling of individual cores down to 0.2 Msun completeness. We will (1) construct the CMF of the cloud as a whole and the three stages individually, to study CMF evolution; (2) quantify the clustering Q-parameter and study its evolution; (3) quantify the virial state of the cores using N2D+ and other lines, to distinguish theoretical models; (4) search for flow motions with a linear resolution better than the studies of nearby filaments.

High-mass star forming regions are relatively few in the solar neighborhood. Much more active and extensive high-mass star formation is found outside the Milky Way. Studies of such regions are important since they provide a link to distant active starbursst. Our target here is the giant molecular cloud (GMC) in N159, an HII region located in the nearest external galaxy Large Magellanic Cloud having lower metalicity than the Milky Way. N159 is the most intense and concentrated molecular cloud as shown by the brightest 12CO J=3-2 source in the LMC, and thus ideal to study the current most-massive cluster formation in the Local Group. Nearby HII region, 30Dor, is not forming massive clusters anymore and is not a suitable witness to cluster formation. Theories predict that cluster-forming regions consist of pre-stellar cores of sub-pc/pc scale and filaments connecting these cores. Such a picture finds increasing support from recent Herschel observation etc. In ALMA cycle1 operation we propose to observe the most active on-going star formation sites in J=2-1 and 1-0 transitions of 12CO and 13CO, J=2-1 transition of CS and dust continuum in band 3 and 6. These observations should provide a powerful tool to probe molecular cores and their connecting filaments for a large density range, 10^2cm^-3 to 10^4cm^-3, relevant to quantify their physical parameters at sub-pc scales.

Feedback from black hole (BH) growth in the quasar phase plays a crucial role in massive galaxy evolution. We propose to obtain ALMA band 6 continuum and CO (6-5) observations of a sample of 10 quasars at z~2 with existing high-resolution HST imaging. This unique sample will allow the first simultaneous study of BH growth in high-redshift quasars together with stellar population, molecular gas and star formation in their host galaxies: ALMA observations is the only way to directly probe the total star formation rate, gas mass and gas kinematics, while HST imaging and ground-based spectroscopy measure the host galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, as well as mass and accretion rate of the central BH. We will study whether quasar host galaxies follow the same star formation vs. stellar mass main sequence as star forming galaxies, whether their star formation process is enhanced by mergers or suppressed by BH activity. We will also determine the galaxy gas content and gas fraction in the quasar phase. Our observations will provide direct constraints on the mode of star formation and feedback during the peak epoch of BH growth, shedding light on the origin of BH/galaxy mass correlation.',\n"," 'Molecular Gas in Debris Disks: Resolving the Disk around 49 Ceti. The dispersal of primordial gas and dust from debris disks sets the timescale for planet formation and is closely intertwined with our understanding of the physical processes that shape planetary systems. While it is generally assumed that molecular gas dissipates before the debris disk stage, the nearby A star 49 Ceti is one of only three systems known to host a tenuous, second-generation debris disk while still retaining a substantial molecular gas reservoir. As the oldest, closest, and best-studied of the three, it is the best target for detailed follow up to elucidate the excitation, chemistry, and kinematics of the gas and dust, as well as to determine whether the gas is primordial or released from evaporating comets. SMA observations in the CO(2-1) line hinted at a surprisingly complex and extended gas disk, but were not sensitive enough to detect continuum emission from the dust. Here we propose to spatially resolve the dust disk for the first time and improve upon the molecular gas observations by an order of magnitude in both sensitivity and spectral resolution. Our objectives are the following: (1) By spatially resolving the dust disk, we will determine whether the gas traces the dust, providing unique insight into the relative dispersal rates and processes of the gas and dust components. (2) By observing CO(3-2) emission at high spectral and spatial resolution we will measure the temperature and density structure of the gas disk and the gas-to-dust ratio. We will also examine the disk kinematics in exquisite detail, following up on the deviations from Keplerian rotation hinted at by the SMA observations. (3) HCN observations in combination with thermo-chemical disk models will allow us to investigate the anomalous C/O ratio hinted at by Herschel observations, and to determine whether the molecular gas is primordial or second-generation (cometary). ALMAs unprecedented sensitivity and resolution will allow us to address basic questions in a field that is starved for information about the enigmatic liminal stage between protoplanetary and debris disks.',\n"," 'Putting kinematic planetary detection techniques to the test in HD 97048. The velocity \"kink\" kinematic signature has gained standing as a promising method for discovering embedded planets. The gravitational influence of a planetary perturber is predicted to drive spiral wakes that disturb the surrounding gas velocity, generating distinct \"kinks\" along the spiral arms in observed velocity channel maps of gas emission. The understanding that velocity kinks are due to spiral arms enables us to make a robust prediction: Every instance of velocity kinks should be concurrent with spiral density waves in other tracers. We propose to search the Band 3 continuum for the spiral wake responsible for the observed velocity kink in the HD 97048 disk. The perturber, HD 97048 b, has already been listed in NASAs exoplanet archive as a confirmed ~2 Jupiter-mass planet. Our observing setup has been carefully designed such that we will be able to draw definitive conclusions as to whether a continuum spiral is present, in the case of a non-detection. Our program will provide an independent verification for the existence of the predicted planet, and more importantly, test the validity of velocity \"kinks\" as signposts of planets in disks.',\n"," 'The ALMA-SPT Redshift Survey. Recent ground and space-based multiwavength (sub)millimeter surveys covering hundreds of square degrees have discovered a large number of strongly lensed, ultra-bright submm galaxies (SMGs). The largest of these, by nearly an order of magnitude at present, is the South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, which covers 1300 square degrees. The unparalleled SPT sky area makes it the survey most adept at locating the brightest of the brightest of this new population. Its 1.4mm detection wavelength ensures a uniform source selection function across z=1-8. Both aspects make SPT the ideal survey to uncover substantial numbers of the elusive z>4 SMG population. We are carrying out a major multi-wavelength (optical to mm) observating campaign aimed at characterizing the SPT sources in terms dust/gas content, star-formation rates and stellar masses. The most urgently missing information are the redshifts. With the advent of ALMA, even in the early science configuration, unbiased redshift searches for these bright high-z sources are possible in a revolutionary small amount time (3-4 redshifts per hour even in moderate observing conditions). We propose to observe the 26 brightest SMGs selected from the SPT survey. Our proposed observations are designed to obtain unambiguous and unbiased redshifts out to z=6, and as such will sample the high redshift tail of SMGs for the first time.',\n"," 'Mapping the Magnetic Field in the Circumstellar Disk in IRAS 16293-2422 B. Theoretical studies of magnetized cores show that the process of magnetic braking makes it very difficult to form a circumstellar disk in the earliest stages of the collapse. It is therefore important to detect, measure and map the magnetic field structure in the disk around a young stellar object. The SMA observations reported recently by us (Rao et al. 2013) of IRAS 16293-2422 B at 345 GHz are the first such measurements of the field structure in a disk. The field structure appears to be following a pattern which is approximately toroidal in geometry. However the SMA observations are affected by inadequate angular resolution (0.6 arcseconds) and sensitivity (relative position angle error of >7 degrees). We propose to image the magnetic field in the circumstellar disk around IRAS 16293-2422 B using ALMA in Band 6 with an angular resolution of 0.2 arcseconds',\n"," 'Probing the earliest stage of protostellar evolution using the CH3OH lines. We propose to observe the first core candidates B1-bN and B1-bS, and a class 0 protostar B1-c using the ground-state CH3OH 5_k--4_k lines at 241.8 GHz. The goal of this project is to search for the compact CH3OH emission from the first core itself. The chemical model of the first core predicts that CH3OH lines can be the suitable tracer for the first core, because its gas-phase abundance jumps up by three orders of magnitude in the first core. In order to detect the compact emission from the first core, we would like to achieve the angular resolution of 0.2\", which is comparable to the size of the first core. The ALMA band-6 receiver allow us to observe the CH3OH lines in the torsionally excited state at 241 GHz at the same time. The CH3OH lines at two different states would be helpful in studying the physical and chemical conditions of the first core candidates. In addition, we plan to observe the H2CO 3_1,2--2_1,1, HDO 3_1,2--2_2,1 and C17O 2--1 lines in the image sideband. These lines would be helpful in understanding the physical and chemical conditions of the first cores,',\n"," 'Dissecting the magnetic-field morphology at 1000AU of an O-type YSO - Combining the VLBI and ALMA scales. The importance of B-fields for the formation of massive young stellar objects (YSOs) is still uncertain. Observationally, we have gained considerable knowledge on the large scale B-field properties (0.1pc), but we still lack information about the inner few 1000AU. We have recently obtained the first detailed picture of the gas dynamics and B-field configuration within 1000AU of a massive YSO with VLBI maser observations. Our results show a significant correlation between the velocity and B-field vectors for maser spots of a few AU in size (1mas). Towards this YSO, we also conducted SMA observations at a resolution >0.7\" (or 3000AU). We propose ALMA observations, with a resolution of a few 100AU, to bridge the gap between the VLBI and SMA scales. We want to measure the B-field configuration in the inner few 1000AU, through dust polarization, and relate it to the gas dynamics at both the small and large scales from a massive YSO. An ordered B-field morphology aligned across 3 orders of magnitude in spatial scales, down to a massive dusty disk rotating about a massive star, will provide the best possible evidence for a dynamically important role of B-fields in massive star formation.',\n"," 'Investigation of Gas-to-Dust Mass Ratio in the Asymmetric Disk around HD 142527 in Band 3. We propose Band 3 observations of the asymmetrically gapped disk around the Herbig Fe star HD142527 in 13CO/C18O J=1-0 and dust continuum at 100 GHz. Our group made Band 7 observations of the disk in Cycle 0. The continuum emission shows strong asymmetry and is extremely bright (Tb=24 K at 156 AU from the star). There are two possible situations that account for these results: (1) the disk is in gravitationally unstable state to form a gaseous planet, or (2) dust grains are highly accumulated to form a rocky planetary core. The key parameter to judge which is the case is gas-to-dust mass ratio (g/d). Our analyses of g/d with disk modeling suggests that g/d in the regions of lowest surface densities may change significantly in radial direction. However, g/d in most regions of the disk cannot be determined solely from Band 7 observations, because J=3-2 lines of 13CO and C18O are optically thick. The disk should be much more transparent to the J=1-0 lines of CO and dust continuum emission in Band 3, allowing us to better estimate g/d and size distribution of dust particles in the entire regions of the disk.',\n"," 'A search for the elusive sub-mm polarisation in protostellar disks. We propose to use ALMA in its narrow-field polarimetry mode to detect sub-mm polarized emission for the first time in a protoplanetary disk. ALMAs high resolution will avoid smearing out of the polarized signal, giving a 5x improvement in beam size and a factor of 100 improvement on the polarised flux over previous studies. The well-studied nearby disk HD163296 is ideal for this work, and we will image the polarisation out to a radius of 145AU to 0.3% rms, giving 60 vectors over the map and 12-15 vectors at the ALMA polarisation sensitivity limit of 0.1% (out to 100AU radius). The orientation and structure of polarisation vectors will allow us to pinpoint the grain alignment mechanism and the degree of alignment and grain non-sphericity. Even a non-detection will provide stringent limit on the shape of mm-sized grains, turbulent mechanisms hampering grain alignment and upper limits to alignment mechanisms.',\n"," 'Exploring quick line and continuum variations in IRC+10216. Millimeter line variation is a new direction of evolved star research. The stable array configuration of ALMA ACA makes it the best millimeter interferomter capable of long term high angular resolution monitoring of AGB stars. Based on ALMA archive data analysis of the archetypal carbon star IRC +10216, we have found possible non-sinusoidal variation patterns, secular trends, and short time oscillations of 1.1mm continuum and line fluxes. The short time variation could be the signature of shock activities in the AGB wind launching region. We propose to perform in Cycle 8 a combination of low (once per month) and high (once per week) cadence ACA-alone monitoring of the star in the same 1.1mm wavelength ranges as in the archival ACA data. We aim at determining the periodicity of these temporal behaviors and characterizing the short term variations. The data will provide unique constraints on complex excitation conditions in the AGB extended atmosphere and inform time dependent AGB wind models.',\n"," 'Measuring the radial profile of the maximum grain size in the 4-planet CI Tau system. CI Tau is the only example of a young hot Jupiter in a disc bearing system and our Cycle 4 high resolution data has demonstrated the presence of three annular gaps in the Band 6 images suggesting the presence of three further giant planets at orbital radii of 13, 39 and 100 au. It thus represents the most fully fledged protoplanetary system ever detected with its planets spanning a record factor 1000 in orbital radius. Interpretation of this spectacular image however requires a knowledge of the radial profile of maximum grain size in the disc to (i) estimate the dust opacity (thus the dust surface density) and (ii) to assess the level of coupling between dust and gas across the disc. The requested Band 3 observations at a resolution of 7 au will allow us to readily distinguish two scenarios: one in which the grains are small and well coupled to the gas (and thus where the dust to gas ratio does not vary radially) and the commonly adopted scenario where the grains have grown to mm sizes. Distinguishing these scenarios is essential in order to characterise this system, to quantify the discs budget of dust and gas and to refine estimates of the planetary masses involved.',\n"," 'Architecture and disk structure in a high-mass protobinary system. High-mass stars exhibit a significantly higher multiplicity frequency than low-mass stars, likely reflecting differences in their formation mechanism. Theoretical work suggests that the high-mass binaries might form via the fragmentation of self-gravitational disks or alternative scenarios such as disk-assisted capture. Intriguingly, in recent VLTI/AMBER near-infrared interferometric observations we detected a close high-mass protobinary with a 57mas (approx. 170AU) separation. Around the individual stars we resolve near-infrared excess emission that is likely associated with hot dust in circumstellar disks. We characterised the system with SMA sub-mm interferometry and identified a suite of outflow- and disk/envelope-tracing lines that we would like to resolve now with ALMA 40mas-resolution imaging. Our aim is to resolve the circumbinary disk/envelope, to study the signatures of binary-disk interaction, and to search for the accretion streamers that feed the circumstellar disks. We will image the outflow-launching region and determine the dynamical mass of the central objects, providing a first glimpse into the evolution of high-mass multiple systems during the accretion phase.',\n"," 'The Large-Scale Environment of the First Quasars. Virtually all models of early black hole growth postulate that they must evolve from massive seeds and accrete at (super-)Eddington rate most of their life. Consequently, quasars that host billion solar mass black holes should form in the largest overdensities in the early Universe. Despite substantial campaigns in the optical and near-infrared, the predicted overdensities of galaxies around high-redshift quasars have never been detected conclusively, leading the current paradigm into crisis. ALMA observations of z>6 quasars have revealed numerous close (few kpc) companions detected via their redshifted [CII] line. However, these detections only probe the small-scale clustering of quasars and galaxies, leaving the question of whether or not quasars inhabit the first large-scale unanswered. This programme will detect galaxies up to 1.5 Mpc from seven 6',\n"," 'Tracing the accretion history of protostars using outflows, an ACA+TP survey. We propose an ACA+TP (5.5\" resolution) outflow survey of 29 protostars in the Orion clouds observed in high-J CO with Herschel/PACS. The high-J CO line luminosity is a measure of the instantaneous mass outflow rate. In contrast, low-J CO emission is a measure of the time averaged mass outflow rate. For our sample, we have shown that the high-J CO emission exhibits a strong correlation with the protostellar L_bol, demonstrating a linkage between instantaneous mass outflow and mass accretion rates. Analyses of other samples of protostars in low-J CO lines show the time averaged mass outflow rate correlates with L_bol, but surprisingly there is also a steady decline in time averaged mass outflow rate with protostellar age. These observations will directly address the difference between instantaneous and time averaged mass outflow rates using uniform observations of a well-characterized sample of protostars. We will: 1. measure the momentum flux and mechanical luminosity of the outflows; 2. establish their dependence on Lbol and protostellar evolutionary class; and 3. place high- and low-J CO informed constraints on the time evolutionary history of mass accretion in protostars.',\n"," 'Unveiling the nature of a strong H2O absorption in a dusty galaxy at z=4.1. Recently, a strong ortho-H2O absorption in a z=6.4 galaxy was interpreted as an impact of CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) by Riechers et al. 2022, and was used to constrain the CMB temperature at z=6.4. Notably, Riecher et al. 2022 concluded that the absorption against the CMB is not detectable at z<5. Nevertheless, we have found a similarly strong H2O absorption in a z=4.1 galaxy with an absorption peak penetrating to negative, which the negative flux is lower than the prediction of Riecher et al. models by 4 orders of magnitude. It is unclear where the huge discrepancy comes from. Outflow+CMB impact is a possible solution to the strong H2O absorption at z=4.1, but this is highly unsure due to the noisy line profile. We propose deep ALMA observation to solidly confirm this absorption with high quality line profile, unveiling the physical structure of the ISM and the possible CMB impact.',\n"," 'Unifying Stars and Gas in Quasar Hosts at z~3 and the Co-Evolution Picture. The physical mechanism of the black hole (BH)-host galaxy co-evolution is one of the most important questions in astrophysics. We propose to extend and complete observations of a unique sample of quasars at z~3, the peak epoch of the active galactic nucleus accretion history. Their host galaxies differ by ~1 dex in their stellar masses M* compared to the BH mass and show significantly different narrow-line region properties traced by their OIII luminosity. These quasars are drawn from 70 quasars whose hosts are studied with Subaru AO-assisted imaging. We detected stellar hosts for 4 and estimated upper limits for the other 3 targets proposed here. By extending our sample to much lower BH masses, these systems can serve as a testbed for the co-evolution mechanism. We will test whether a larger amount of gas is present in the more evolved hosts and hence the expected extreme CO luminosities that will allow spatially and dynamically resolved CO line observations similar to our Cycle 3/4 programs. Together with our M* estimates/limits, we will use the gas and dynamical mass estimates to trace their past and possible future evolution onto the established local BH-host scaling relations.',\n"," 'Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby Galaxies: The Local Galaxy Inventory. We propose to utilize the ACA (7m+TP) to map the full star forming disks of three nearby, large-on-the-sky galaxies (NGC 300, NGC 253, Circinus) in CO(2-1) in order to assess their molecular ISM at scales of individual molecular clouds (50-100 pc). These data will provide key insight into the interplay between galactic environment and cloud-scale molecular gas. These galaxies harbor a range of physical environments, from AGN to nuclear starburst to flocculent spiral, and thus provide a crucial link between the Local Group (where high resolution permits study of sub-cloud scale physics) and the broader galaxy population (which includes a wider range of environments). With these data we will measure GMC properties and scaling relations, cloud lifetimes, and star formation efficiency as a function of the diverse environments found in these galaxies. The resolution, sensitivity, and spatial coverage match those of our ongoing Large Program to map the disks of more distant targets with the 12m array, and so these additional galaxies will both fold into and inform the larger sample while providing context for ongoing and future zoom-in studies.',\n"," 'Forming hub-filament systems: An unbiased study of the gas kinematics of increasingly complex filamentary structures. Converging network of filaments, also known as hub-filament systems (HFSs), are known to host the formation of some of the most massive stars in the Milky Way. However, the physics that link the formation and evolution of HFSs with the formation of massive stars remains unclear. It has recently been proposed that HFSs could come together as the result of clump collapse, while other scenarios, invoke turbulence-driven filament-filament collisions, or cloud-cloud collisions as a formation mechanism. Here, we propose to unveil the time evolution of filamentary structures towards the formation of HFSs. For that purpose, we propose to follow-up with ALMA a complete sample of clumps of varying stages of evolution, with varying filament complexities and masses. In combination with dedicated numerical simulations of cloud evolution, we will use ALMA to map the dense gas kinematics of all clumps to produce time-dependent gas dynamics estimators. With both numerical and observational data in hand, we will in a position to determine what evolutionary path(s) HFSs follow.',\n"," 'Using absorption to constrain the 3D structure of the Galactic center ISM. Our current knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of gas in the center of our Galaxy is significantly incomplete. Uncertainties in the distribution of Galactic center gas are a fundamental limitation to understanding the mass flows responsible for transporting gas from hundreds of parsecs to the scale of the black hole. We propose to make observations of CO absorption toward two dozen HII regions that will directly constrain the distribution of the dense and diffuse CMZ gas in the line of sight direction. These data will break the near/far distance degeneracy for orbital models of the dense CMZ gas and resolve long-standing disagreements about the gas within 20 pc of the central black hole. Quadrupling the number of absorption lines of sight for studying the diffuse molecular gas will also significantly improve our understanding of the extent and geometry of the poorly studied low-density molecular gas, which may be the dominant mass component in this region. The positional information from this study will significantly improve our understanding of gas dynamics in the Galactic center, informing evolutionary models and facilitating comparison with other galaxy nuclei.',\n"," 'The ISM at z~7: Deploying a successfully piloted technique to find the brightest [CII] emitters at z>6.5. Astronomers have long anticipated using [CII] to pursue a physical study of galaxies in the epoch of reionization. Yet current probes with ALMA have had a low yield in identifying bright [CII] emission at z>6. Perhaps this could be due to the almost exclusive targeting of galaxies with spec-zs from Lyman alpha? Seeking a different approach, we recently executed a pilot program pursuing efficient line scans on two luminous galaxies at z~7. Amazingly, with just 1 hour of observations, 2 >=6 sigma [CII] lines were found, exceeding the luminosity of all prior detections in z>6.1 galaxies. The surprising success of our pilot suggests that luminous [CII] galaxies do exist at z>6, but perhaps not in those galaxies showing Lyman-alpha emission. Here we propose to extend our pilot program to target 6 more extremely luminous galaxies at z~7 with precise photometric redshift constraints (leveraging 2 sharp spectral features). Our program would measure redshifts for sources, constrain the masses of the brightest galaxies at z~7, and allow for an extensive suite of follow-up activities.',\n"," 'The sequential star formation towards the IR bright rim of an HII bubble. Despite that optical and infrared (IR) surveys have found active formation of young stellar objects around extended IR bubbles, the details of how the impulse-driven molecular clouds form and how they subsequently fragment and form dense star-forming clumps/cores are not yet clear. IR bright bubble rim N2 is an ideal region for a pilot study on the star formation correlation with the feedback from a morphologically associated OB cluster. Our recent single-dish observations indicate chemical evolutionary sequence towards the dense molecular clumps along this expanding shell of the HII bubble. Aiming at improving our understanding of the star-forming scenario towards these clumps, we are proposing for (1) characterising the multi-scale physical structure and searching for the proof of dynamically evolutionary sequence, by resolving the clumps with the dense gas tracers and the continuum emission at 2 and 3 mm; (2) giving the constraints on the evolutionary status of each clump, by tracing the warm/cold gas and the outflow(s). Comparing with the \"spontaneous\" star-forming regions, we will test whether triggering or the gravity compress leads to the star formation towards N2.',\n"," 'Resolved star formation and molecular gas distribution in the most distant cluster at z=2.506. We propose 0.2\"-resolution CO[3-2] and 870 um continuum observations of a remarkably dense structure with extended X-ray emission at z = 2.506 recently discovered in COSMOS (Wang+2016, submitted), which is arguably the most distant X-ray detected cluster known to date. This structure is also unique in its high concentration of massive galaxies and enhanced star formation activities, containing 11 massive galaxies (3 AGNs) within a 10\" radius with a combined star formation rate of 3400 Msun/yr. These properties suggest that we are witnessing the rapid formation phase of a dense cluster core, the missing link to understand the build-up of cluster ellipticals. With a single pointing, the proposed observation will spatially resolve the molecular gas and dust distribution for 6 cluster members that were already detected in CO[1-0] with JVLA. This will enable the most comprehensive study of star formation and ISM properties in a dense environment at the key formation epoch of a massive cluster. The extent of gas and dust distribution, the gas kinematics and resolved star formation efficiency will provide crucial constraints on the formation mechanisms of cluster ellipticals.',\n"," 'Mapping molecular gas exposed to strong X-rays, cosmic-rays and shocks of the supernova remnant. Supernova (SN) feedback plays a key role in regulating galaxy evolution and star forming rate. Despite ample theoretical studies of SN feedback, it still lacks observational constraints on how SN energy is transferred to the ISM through different feedback channels such as X-rays, cosmic rays (CRs), and shocks. As the most luminous Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) in the X-ray band and energetic CR accelerator, W49B is an ideal laboratory to study SN feedback in detail. Recently, HCO+ emission and HCO+/CO have been proposed as a potentially useful probe of multi-channel feedback of SNRs onto molecular clouds (MCs). We propose ALMA HCO+ 1-0 and 3-2, and CO 3-2 observations toward W49B, aiming 1) to unveil how MC properties are controlled by X-rays, CRs, and shocks, and 2) to quantify the SNR energy transferred to the MCs. This observation will also provide crucial insight into the molecular heating and chemistry near extragalactic high-energy sources.',\n"," 'A unique and massive z=4.3 protocluster from the South Pole Telescope 2500 deg^2 survey. We propose to obtain deep line spectroscopy and continuum imaging towards the densest protocluster system discovered so far, SPT2349-56 at z=4.3. This system has been recently confirmed, using ALMA in cycle-4, having 13 ULIRGs/SMGs detected in dust-continuum and 9 detected in CO emission within 20\" (integrated SFR of ~10^4 Msun/yr). Since it was found in a blind 1.4-mm survey of 2500 deg^2, it is unlikely there are many other systems like these in the entire sky. The proposed observations are thus essential to obtain an unbiased, coherent census of galaxy population in this truly unique protocluster field. Our main goals are to (i) characterize the environment, by identifying all line emitters down to 0.2mJy over the full LABOCA-detected structure. Given the high density of ULIRGs already detected, we expect to detect a plethora of fainter CO emitting galaxies at z=4.3. Along with our rich complimentary data, this proposal will enable a full characterization of the protocluster galaxy properties (gas, dynamical and stellar masses; multi-line diagnostics of the ISM).',\n"," 'Water emission from the T Tauri star DG Tau: disk or outflow ?. The quest for the water reservoir in protoplanetary disks is crucial to understand the origin of oceans on terrestrial planets. We detected with Herschel/HIFI the fundamental lines of ortho- and para-H2O at 557 GHz and 1113 GHz towards a young T Tauri star, DG Tau. Both lines show a double-peaked profile consistent with emission from the warm disk surface out to ~90 AU. Surprisingly, the emission is ~20 times brighter than in the other T Tauri disk detected so far in these lines (TW Hya). However, the interpretation is limited by the low angular resolution of Herschel (beam ~19\"-38\") which does not allow to rule out possible contamination from a molecular outflow. We propose to obtain observations of DG Tau with ALMA in the H218O line at 203.4 GHz at ~0.3\"-1.8\". This will allow us to detect water emission down to a sensitivity of 0.5 mJy and to recover the line profile, hence to understand if the emission originates from the disk (compact emission showing double-peaked profile with ~14 km/s peak separation) or from the outflow (possibly extended emission showing high-velocity blue-/red-shifted wings) and to quantify the amount of water in the disk/outflow.',\n"," 'Recovering the flux lost toward VY CMa. VY CMa is the best studied Red Supergiant stars. Its study is shedding light to the mass loss processes which drive the mass ejection in this phase of the massive star evolution, and its ejecta allow us to understand the dust formation in O-rich environments with elemental abundances dominated by the hot-bottom burning and the third dredge up. However, to obtain an accurate view of both the shaping and chemical processes taking place in this star we must recover the flux lost in previous ALMA observations. The aim of this proposal is to complement these ALMA data with short-spacing visibilities to recover the emission from the most extended components and to be able to obtain the most complete understanding of the aforementioned processes.',\n"," 'Disentangling the fibers of L1495/B213. Filamentary structures dominate the large-scale images of clouds made with Spitzer and Herschel, and suggest that star formation is associated to the process of filamentary fragmentation. Spitzer and Herschel images, however, only trace the distribution of dust, and therefore lack information on the gas velocity field. When this information is added, using molecular line observations, many filaments are found to be in fact complex networks of smaller structures often called fibers. These fibers seem to be the true parent structures of the dense cores and protostars, and therefore the ultimate place of star formation. In this proposal we request ALMA time to observe the most nearby group of fibers, located in the L1495/B213 region of Taurus. Our C18O(1--0) observations will aim to disentangle a surprisingly complex network of fibers that seem to be at a very early evolutionary state. With these observations we aim to characterize the internal properties of the fibers, and to shed some light on their not-yet-understood process of formation.',\n"," 'Masses of Low Mass T Tauri Stars.

Isotopic ratios provide a window into the nucleosynthetic processes which have molded the chemical composition of evolved stars. Recent measurements of 12C/13C ratios in several planetary nebulae (PNe) are indicative of J-type stars, whose low 12C/13C ratios are difficult to reconcile with existing nucleosynthetic models. One suggested alternative is a helium flash which results in a flash production and ejection of 13C and 15N. The recent discovery of an extremely 15N-enriched PN showing signatures of a J-type progenitor by Schmidt et al. lends credence to this idea, and suggests that these objects could be important sources of 15N in the Galaxy. In order to explore this idea, we propose to image several PNe with potential J-type progenitors in transitions of HCN, H13CN, and HC15N at Band 6. By comparing the distributions of 12C and 13C across the nebulae and exploring the kinematic structure of the outflows, we may elucidate the nucleosynthetic processes resulting in such ratios. Further, the detection or non-detection of HC15N may allow us to analyze the viability of the helium flash as a model which explains the observed properties of J-type stars.',\n"," 'B3 observation of a super-deep field in HDF-S. The HDF-S field has many orbits of HST data as well as optical/NIR followup, but almost no coverage from ALMA. Observing a blank field inside HDF-S that goes deeper than any existing sub-mm observations in the more subscribed fields could motivate the community to apply in the future for observations in this range of hour angles (HDF-S is located at 22:32:56.22, -60:33:02.69), and will add value to existing optical and NIR observations. This RA is the least subscribed range in long-baseline configurations. Having a sub-mm flux measurement or even flux upper limit could help studies of galaxy number counts, spectral energy distribution fitting, or simply providing high redshift galaxy targets to followup which are located in a field not yet extensively observed at these frequencies, and having a lower observational pressure at the telescope.',\n"," 'ALMA Observations of Dusty AGNs in Dwarf Galaxies. While AGNs have now been found in hundreds of dwarf galaxies, very little is known about the molecular gas and dust that can fuel and obscure the black holes in these objects.

We aim to directly detect the CO (2-1) line and dust continuum in the immediate vicinity of the AGNs and disentangle this emission from that of the host galaxies on larger scales. With the proposed observations, we will 1) determine the mass, morphology, and kinematics of the cold molecular gas in our target dwarf galaxies hosting AGNs, and 2) measure emission from the dusty tori at mm wavelengths and construct the AGN SEDs in combination with existing observations at infrared to X-ray wavelengths from WISE, HST, and Chandra. Ultimately, this project will provide valuable information on black hole feeding and feedback, as well as the panchromatic energy output of AGNs in the relatively unexplored low-mass regime.',\n"," 'Spatially resolved deep submm follow-up of z > 6 low-luminosity quasars with approved JWSTs stellar light observations. In this program, we will measure [CII] and FIR continuum emission of a sample of 8 low-luminosity quasars at z > 6. All of our sample will be observed by JWST to robustly measure the stellar light of their host galaxies. Combined with the stellar mass data, we will discuss the location of these quasars relative to the star-forming main sequence. Our high resoliution (0.3\") observations will also provide a spatially resolved picture of specific star formation rate. These will tell if the quasar feedback (quenching) is in action particularly around the nucleus. As these quasars are likely to be hosted by lower mass galaxies, we can perform a fair comparison of the host galaxy properties with non-AGN normal galaxies (such as provided by ALPINE and REBELS programs studying at comparable cosmic times): we will identify the distinctive properties of quasar hosts, which is crucial to understand the triggering mechanism of quasar activity. Owing to the high resolution, we will also perform dynamical modelings of the host galaxies to obtain their dynamical masses. With these, we will test the usual assumption in z > 6 quasar studies, dynamical mass ~ stellar mass.',\n"," 'High-Resolution Mapping of Titans Atmospheric Composition, Dynamics and Temperature Near Southern Winter Solstice in Synergy with Cassini.

Early theoretical works predict a population of early-stage mergers in overdense environments within the Submillimeter Galaxy (SMG) population. Nevertheless, the observational evidence for these interactions has been scarce, and the influence of the environment on their star formation process is still not fully understood. Combining large-area surveys carried out with Herschel with new ALMA and AzTEC imaging we have built a sample of 5 galaxy-pair SMGs candidates, which are likely early-stage mergers. Here, we request band 3 and band 4 observations to perform a blind spectral scan in order to: (1) confirm the nature of these systems and find new associated sources; (2) test the predictions of various theoretical works on the nature of the SMG population; and (3) characterize the star formation process during the earliest stages of galaxy interactions. This project will provide the first confirmed sample of early-stage mergers and reveal high-redshift protocluster structures rich in extreme star-forming galaxies, ultimately shedding light on the influence of the environment on the star formation process.',\n"," 'Map molecular cloud chemistry and turbulence across a spiral arm of M83. Both molecular cloud (MC) chemistry and interstellar turbulence are tightly related to the dynamics of spiral arms. Our gas-grain chemical modeling of MC evolution through a spiral arm has already predicted significant chemical differences between upstream/downstream clouds. However, the chemical differences of MCs and distribution of turbulence between spiral arms and upstream/downstream interarm regions are difficult to investigate in the Milky Way due to our location in the Galactic plane. We use ALMA to map CO, SO, H2CO and CH3OH lines around the the eastern arm of the face-on southern spiral galaxy M83 to investigate the environment dependent cloud chemistry and turbulence properties and to test our chemical models. The results shall be also instructive to the study back in Milky Way.',\n"," 'Molecular shocks in the nucelar region of NGC 4038 (Antennae galaxies). Numerical simulations of galaxy mergers have predicted the ubiquitous presence of gas inflows into the nuclear region. The inflowing gas could collide with gas component associated with the nuclear region, causing molecular shocks, and the gas density increases rapidly. From our previous observations with ALMA, we find a signature of gas inflow and molecular shocks in the nuclear region of NGC 4038. We suggest that the molecular shocks may be caused by collisions between the inflowing gas and the central massive molecular complex. The main purpose of this proposal is to quantify the density of molecular gas in the shock region. We thus propose to image the nuclear region of NGC 4038 in the three dense/shocked gas at 50 pc scale. We will compare the density of molecular gas in the shock regions with the other regions to confirm, observationally, the scenario that the density of molecular gas increases in the shock region created by merger-induced gas inflows. Furthermore, we found that the distributions of CH3OH and HNCO are slightly different in the nuclear region of NGC 4038. We also aim to investigate the origin of the different distributions of these two shock tracers.',\n"," 'Searching for feedback with 3D multi-phase interstellar medium study in z~2 quasar host galaxies. Luminous quasars are a thousand times more prevalent at z=2 than present day. This rapid period of super-massive black hole accretion coincides with the peak period of galaxy growth. Yet the effects of quasar activity on their host galaxies are still poorly constrained by observations. We are conducting a distant quasar host galaxy survey using integral field spectroscopy (IFS) and adaptive optics (AO) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. The advent of near-infrared IFS with AO allows studying morphology and dynamics of the ionized gas in quasar host galaxies. For cycle 5 we are proposing to observe the cold molecular gas reservoir of five z = 1.5 - 2.3 quasar host galaxies through CO J=3-2 or J=4-3 emission redshifted into band 4. Our sample contains quasars that have rich multi-wavelength data sets and have shown evidence of powerful extended ionized outflows. These outflows coincide with regions of low star formation. Critical high-resolution ALMA observations will allow us to investigate if molecular gas is absent in these outflow regions. Together with the lack of detected star formation, this will suggest for quenching of star formation due to negative quasar feedback.',\n"," 'Characterizing the accretion structures around the HMYSOs in W51. The formation process of the most massive O-type stars is one of the main open issues in star formation. There has not yet been a clear detection of a Keplerian accretion disk reported around an O-type forming star. We recently observed accretion structures on ~1000 AU (0.15\", resolution 0.04\") scales at 1.1 mm, but these structures are far more disordered than the disks seen around low-mass stars. The presence of outflows indicates that the structures are linked to disks on small scales (<500 AU). However, with existing 1 mm data, ths innermost region is obscured by optically thick dust. We propose to image the accretion structures in three well-known high-mass (>20 solar masses) forming stars massive star-forming complex W51 and address the following questions: (1) What are the kinematics on scales <500 AU, where the dust is optically thick at 1 mm but thin at 3 mm? (2) How much of the continuum emission seen on 300 AU scales is free-free emission from ionized gas? What fraction, if any, of the disk is ionized? Are the outflows from these high-mass protostars ionized? (3) Are there large grains in the accretion flow or around the disk?',\n"," 'Ice Desorption Illuminating Hidden Planetary Companions. In the early phases of planet formation, young gas-giants still embedded in their parent disks are luminous, ~(1-10) x 10^-4 Lsun, both during the accretion phase and immediately after (within a few Myr). Using 3D chemical models, we found that these planets provide more than enough heat to locally sublimate ices, thereby creating a unique gas phase signature surrounding the planet itself, spanning ~5 AU for a Jupiter-mass protoplanet. Furthermore, the relevant chemical processes (freeze-out and thermal desorption) are rapid compared to disk rotation, and thus the signature follows the planet in its orbit. We propose to apply this chemical imaging technique to search for young, Jupiter-mass planets in the TW Hya protoplanetary disk, where fine-scale ringed structure was recently discovered with ALMA (Andrews et al. 2016), perhaps indicative of the early stages of planet growth. By looking for the youngest planets (i.e., ones that are either just beginning to form gaps or have not yet cleared their orbits), we can put unique constraints on the driving mechanisms of planet formation in disks around solar-type stars.',\n"," 'Water as a tracer of the ISM conditions in high-z active galaxies: A pilot study on hot dust obscured galaxies.. Water is the third most abundant molecule in galaxies, after CO, and in recent years it has proved to be a valuable tracer of the ISM conditions in low redshift galaxies. Up to now the high redshift detections have been few and limited to lensed sub-mm galaxies, but in our recent ALMA observations of two hot dust obscured galaxies (HotDOGs) we serendipitously detected water transitions. Here we propose a follow up on these sources, targeting three different water transitions, the combination of which will help identify the different components of the ISM. HotDOGs are ideal for such a study, as they are going through intence star-formation and BH growth, with high levels of obscuration. They have been proposed to represent the transitional phase between the starburst and quasar phases of popular galaxy evolution models. This pilot study will allow us to demonstrate the power of using water as a molecular gas tracer at high-z, and will allow for the design of representative future studies.',\n"," 'Resolving kinematics of a giant gas disk at a z=3 protocluster core using [CII]. Submillimeter-bright galaxies (SMGs) are dusty, gas-rich, high-z galaxies that show intense starburst activity. SMGs are possible progenitor of early type galaxies in the center of the cluster in the local Universe, and thus SMGs in a proto-cluster in the early Universe can play a key role in understanding the formation and evolution of the most massive galaxies across cosmic time. Here we propose a deep [CII] imaging of a bright SMG located at the z=3.1 SSA22 proto-cluster core. The CO(3-2) emission reveals a giant gas disk on more than 30 kpc scale, and the suggested rotation velocity is about 600 km/s. These characteristics, together with the proto-cluster environment, make the SMG an important target. Using the bright [CII] line as a reliable tracer, we will uncover gas kinematics of the gigantic gas disk at z=3, and how the proto-cluster environment influences the growth of galaxies and SMBHs in the early epoch.',\n"," 'Adjusting the Reception of The Antennae: A Clear Look at GMCs in a Major Merger. We propose to map the nearest major merger, the Antennae, in CO (1-0) and (2-1) at giant molecular clouds scales (~40 pc). This iconic system was targeted during ALMA commissioning, but does not yet have a high fidelity, high resolution map of the entire system in a CO line. With active star formation spread out across a range of environments, the Antennae is an excellent proxy for star-forming galaxies and galaxy mergers at moderate redshifts (z=1-2). Using the proposed observations, we will build a catalogue of GMCs with measured properties (radius, linewidth, luminosity), determine the factors driving the formation of super-giant molecular clouds, study the CO(2-1)/(1-0) line ratio and its variations from cloud to galaxy scales, and measure the CO-to-H2 conversion factor for both CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) lines. These observations provide the first high fidelity maps of the molecular gas in the Antenna from the cloud scale up to the full extent of the interacting galaxy disks.',\n"," 'High resolution characterization of early bulge structure and feedback in a z = 7.07 low-luminosity quasar. Recent ALMA observations of [CII] emission toward the z=7.07 low-luminosity quasar, J1243+0100, have shown following outstanding features: (1) massive host galaxy likely associated with a massive, compact bulge, and (2) fast AGN-driven [CII] outflow. However, due to the limited resolution of the previous work (0.7\"), it was difficult to provide firm evidence of the bulge, as well as to investigate detailed properties of the [CII] outflow. In this program (0.23\" resolution), we will spatially resolve these intriguing structures at [CII]. We will deliver the following. (1) Detailed gas dynamics: we will measure the rotation curve at r < 2 kpc of this quasar. By firmly capturing a steep rise in this curve, we can characterize the massive bulge even at z ~7. (2) Mapping the [CII] outflow: we will estimate various outflow properties as a function of the distance from the nucleus, providing a more faithful view on the nature of this AGN feedback. (3) Detailed gas distribution: We can compare the gas distribution of J1243+0100 with those of luminous quasars to study what is critically different between luminous and low-luminosity quasars on scales of kpc.',\n"," 'Detection of a circumbinary disk around the high-mass protostar G 014.23-00.50 showing periodic flux variability. We propose continuum and CH3CN/SiO thermal line observations in band 3 to detect a circumbinary disk around the high-mass protostar (HMP) G 014.23-00.50, which has shown flaring flux variations with the period of 23.9 days (the shortest so far). The evolutionary sequence of HMPs is still under debate because the mass accretion rate onto the stellar surface, where is directly unreachable tiny area even with ALMA, is the most significant factor to define evolutionary tracks. To understand the accretion rate in such a tiny area, periodic flux variability observed mainly in CH3OH masers around HMPs is the most powerful probe in terms of its time-scales from a few tens to a few hundreds days, corresponding to the spatial scales of 0.1-1 au (e.g., under the condition of Keplerian rotation). The periodic flares in the target source G 014.23 might be explained by a variation of the dust temperature at the maser emitting region on a circumbinary disk. As the first step in series to challenge flux monitor observations with ALMA in the next cycle, here we would like to detect a compact and spatially resolved object with evidence of a binary, which could be interpreted as a circumbinary disk.',\n"," 'Structural Evolution of Molecular Clouds Triggered by Supergiant Shells in LMC. We propose 12CO J=1-0 mapping observations of twenty molecular clouds along the \"molecular ridge\" in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Our aim is to illustrate the evolution of molecular clouds in the viewpoint of development of internal compact structures (which are directly relevant to star/cluster formation) and investigate the mechanisms that underlie the evolution -- in the LMC, the most likely trigger is interactions with supergiant shells (SGSs). The northern part of the ridge is a site of ongoing interaction between the gas and expanding (east to west) SGS, while its southern part is not associated with any known SGS. Therefore the ridge is an ideal target to test the SGS-induced evolution of the clouds. We expect that the proposed high-resolution (0.5 pc) high-fidelity images, obtained by combining the 12-m, 7-m, and TP Arrays, reveal the north-to-south (and potentially east-to-west) transition of internal structures of the clouds.',\n"," 'The early evolution of super star clusters in the nuclear starburst of NGC 4945. We propose to use the unparalleled capabilities of ALMA to perform Band 7 imaging and spectroscopy of NGC4945, the nearest archetypal example of a starburst and AGN (Sy 2) nucleus. ALMA Band 3 imaging and recombination line observations have revealed the presence of super star clusters (SSCs) in the central starburst, which are highly obscured at NIR wavelengths. However, the Band 3 observations lack the sensitivity to identify the full cluster population and lack molecular spectroscopy probing the very-dense, cluster environment. Band 7 spectroscopy at 1.8 pc resolution of CS 7-6 and H13CN 4-3 from highly-excited dense gas will allow us to determine the kinematics, virial mass, and radial momentum associated with each cluster. We will also obtain Band 7 continuum imaging to trace the dust, a mass-dominant component of SSCs, and its spectral index, an indicator of the dust opacity and therefore feedback from dust-processed radiation pressure. The proposed observations enable the next steps in our understanding of the formation and evolution of young, massive clusters.',\n"," 'Studies of disk+outflow systems in high-mass star formation with KaVA and ALMA. We propose a survey of high-mass young stellar objects (HM-YSOs) associated with the 22 GHz H2O masers to investigate physical properties of their disk+outflow systems. We have been conducting monitoring observations of the 22 GHz H2O masers toward 17 HM-YSOs to investigate 3D velocity structures of outflows in the KaVA (KVN and VERA Array) Large Program. In the proposed ALMA Band 6 observations, we will identify powering sources of outflows traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers and obtain their physical properties using dust continuum. In addition, we will observe molecular lines to reveal spatial and velocity structures. Thermal lines of CH3OH and HCOOCH3, and 213 GHz class II CH3OH maser trace disks, while thermal SiO and 229 GHz class I CH3OH masers probe outflows. They will be used to fill the gap between central HM-YSOs and maser distributions emitted in the outflows. We can derive physical parameters such as dynamical time scale, mass loss rate, mass accretion rate, etc, by combining the KaVA proper motion measurements. These comprehensive studies will be compared with theoretical models to understand mass accretion through disks, mass ejection, and feedback to the ambient gas.',\n"," 'The cold debris disk in the unique multi-planetary system around HR 8799. HR 8799 is the only multi-planet system with direct imaging available, and its debris disk is a prime ALMA target to understand how planetary systems form and evolve. We propose to observe continuum emission of the cold debris disk of HR 8799 at 230 GHz (Band 6) in order to (1) determine the disk structure probing for signatures of resonant structures, asymmetries and spiral structure; (2) constrain the unknown disk inclination; and (3) determine accurately the inner disk edge. We will determine the disk structure with unpredecented accuracy and will compare the observed structure with the predictions of models. The data will be combined with matched resolution data at 345 GHz (Band 7) from a Cycle 0 progam if it gets completed. The two datasets will allow to contrast the disk at two different wavelengths, allowing tighter constraints on the nature of any observed structure. Finally, our program will provide a first epoch at 230 GHz for the exploration of orbital motion of any observed structures.',\n"," 'Filamentary streamers, accretion flows, multiplicity and disks in the proto-O star W33A. We propose to follow-up our Cycle 1 (delivered in Cycle 2) observations to fully trace the 3D velocity field of the material accreting onto a newly forming O-star. Our target, W33A, a proto-O-star, is nearby (2.4 kpc) and well studied, already having a rare combination of high resolution observations at near-IR (Gemini-AO- 0.13\") and mid-IR (VLTI-MIDI - 0.04\") plus our Cycle 1 data (~0.3\"). Our ALMA data show a spiral filament feeding material to the central region, where the velocity profile show signs of rotation, suggesting the O-star is forming via a disk. This `disk appears disrupted by infalling streams (we find at one on 1000au scales - Maud et al. 2017 MNRAS 472 120), fragmentation due to gravitational instability, or interaction with companions. However, we have not yet resolved the disk scales <500au of the system to determine which is the case. Our 3D radiative transfer models (dust & gas) including infall from the outer rotating envelope onto a compact system best matches the binary scenario (disk radii <250au). ALMA will reveal the answer, as it is the only instrument that can zoom in and image the sub-100au scales, allowing us to test massive star formation theories.',\n"," 'Redshifts of bright Herschel gravitational lenses. We propose to continue our successful ACA CO redshift measurements of 30 of the brightest (S500m > 0.1 Jy) strongly gravitationally lensed submm galaxies from the Herschel ATLAS, plus 3 bright ACT mm-wave sources. These simple observations, ideal for the ACA, will double the sample size of H-ATLAS background source redshifts, complementing our long-term 8m-class foreground lens redshift campaigns. Our pioneering lens selection (Negrello et al. 2010 Science) has an astonishing ~100% efficiency and the gravitational amplification makes CO line detection up to ~100× faster than in unlensed surveys. We will provide spectroscopic confirmation of gravitational lensing, by finding submm redshifts that are clearly higher than the redshifts of the lensing masses. This on its own is already enough to make statistical constraints on the dark matter halo profiles. Combined with our ongoing multi-wavelength campaigns, we will start placing direct constraints on the evolving dark matter distribution of the lenses. The joint lens\\xadsource redshift distribution is a key discriminator of cosmological parameters and the evolution of dark matter haloes.',\n"," 'A heavy-element radio recombination line towards a post-AGB object?. We have detected a line at 232.024 GHz towards the post-AGB object HD101584 in previous ALMA observations. The only reasonable identification is a 30alpha recombination line of Mg, Si, S, or Fe (or a combination of them). In this proposal we aim to confirm this identification by searching for the 26alpha line at 353.807 GHz in the same object. We support these observations by a radiative transfer model of recombination lines that shows that under certain conditions (reasonable in this context) heavy-element recombination lines can be much stronger than e.g. the corresponding lines of H. If successful, this will be the first detection ever of a radio recombination line towards such a cool object, and it suggests that recombination lines can be used as important tools for studying highly evolved stars (such as post-AGB objects and yellow hypergiants), e.g., magnetic field estimates, spectroscopy of chromospheres, and studies of the atomic envelopes of these objects using ALMA.',\n"," 'Mapping the [NII] 122 micron line in high-z galaxies.. We propose to greatly improve our study of the high-z galaxies SMMJ02399-0136 and H1413-117 (the Cloverleaf QSO) at z=2.81 and z=2.56 respectively, by adding high spatial resolution observations of the redshifted [NII] 122 µm line that only ALMA can provide. We have previously detected this line in these two sources using our instrument ZEUS on the CSO. Both sources reside at the epoch of peak star formation in the Universe and have been extensively studied at other wavelengths. Taking advantage of the resolving power and sensitivity of ALMA ES, we will identify the sources of the [NII] (star formation or AGN), characterize the starburst within each source, and probe the star formation rate/molecular mass relationship.',\n"," 'Resolving the Star-Forming Gas of a Main-Sequence Galaxy at Cosmic Noon. In terms of resolution, observations of molecular gas still lag significantly behind those of the stellar emission at z~2. Thus, crucial questions remain open, e.g.: What were the main sites of star formation at Cosmic Noon? What was the temperature, density and kinetic energy content of the star-forming gas? We propose to start answering these by resolving the CO(2-1) and CO(5-4) emission of a typical z=1.6 main-sequence galaxy, down to a physical resolution of 1kpc. With the proposed CO(2-1) observations, we will identify whether the molecular gas is distributed in a large central reservoir, kpc-size clumps or structures more typical of local galaxies. We will measure the gas velocity dispersion down to 20 km/s allowing us to distinguish between thin and thick disks for the first time at z>1. Additionally, by resolving the CO(5-4) emission we will model radial variations in the temperature and density of the molecular gas, thereby identifying the sites of ongoing star formation. Selected from the HUDF, our target is one of the best-studied main-sequence galaxies at Cosmic Noon and presents the ideal opportunity to connect deep high-resolution multi-wavelength observations.',\n"," 'Hot Water in HL Tau. Low mass protostar HL Tau is the topic of intensive study, in particular since ALMA Long Baseline Campaign observations revealed signs of planet formation in a protoplanetary system < 1 Myr. Here, we seek to followup on a recently-reported detection of hot water towards HL Tau. Water is believed to play a key role in star and planet formation, so understanding the nature of this emission is important. Previously interpreted as due to thermal emission, we believe the observations show indications of maser emission, and request ALMA high angular resolution observations at 321 GHz to confirm this, plus observations at 183, 325 and 658 GHz to enable constrained radiative transfer modeling. The observations will locate the masers in the system - are they associated with shocks in a jet or also in the disk - and can enable mapping of source structures on angular scales much smaller than the beam size. Radiative transfer modeling will provide physical conditions in the jet/disk. It can also measure the ortho:para ratio of water that may have been sputtered off cold dust grains. Detection of water masers towards HL Tau provides a new avenue for the study of low mass protoplanetary systems.',\n"," '[C II]158 micron Emision from Absorption-Selected Galaxies at z ~ 4. A primary science driver of the ALMA observatory is to \"Detect the spectral line emission from CO or CII in a normal galaxy like the Milky Way at $z$=3...\". With this goal in mind, our group has systematically surveyed galaxies in absorption to pursue this objective. Specifically, we have identified damped Lya systems (DLAs), HI-selected galaxies linked to Milky Way progenitors, with strong CII* 1335 absorption at redshifts optimal for 158 micron observations with ALMA. Our Cycle 2 program is an ongoing project targeting z~2 DLAs. With Cycle 3, we transition to z>4 where ALMA observations are far more sensitive. The proposed observations target 3 DLAs drawn from a sample of 35 systems confirmed to have very strong CII* absorption. Together with high metallicity and large kinematic profiles make these systems the ideal candidates for detection with ALMA in the strongest atomic line seen in Milky Way-type galaxies.',\n"," 'Mapping the Interstellar Medium of HI-Rich Galaxies at z~4. We propose to map the [CII] emission of two z~4 star-forming galaxies previously detected in cycle 3. These galaxies were originally targeted due to the presence of a damped Lyman alpha system (DLA) in the spectrum of a nearby quasar. This makes these galaxies unique for several reasons. First, their selection based on absorption means they represent a more typical galaxy at these redshifts. Second, their observed properties can be used to learn more about the difficult-to-observe DLA-galaxy connection. Finally, the kinematics of the DLA can be compared to the kinematics of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the galaxy, allowing insight into the interplay between the ISM and HI gas at high redshift. The proposed observations will have resolutions of ~1kpc and ~2kpc allowing us to spatially resolve the emission in both galaxies, and determine: 1) the dynamical mass, and 2) the velocity structure of the ISM of the galaxy. With this data we will -for the first time- provide a direct mass estimate of a galaxy associated with a high redshift DLA, and determine if the HI gas around these high redshift galaxies is inflowing, outflowing or tracing the passive circumgalactic medium.',\n"," 'Feebdack or mergers? Detailed characterisation of an exceptional molecular gas ejection at z=1.4. We propose deep ALMA Band 3 follow-up of ID2299, a massive starburst galaxy at z=1.4 that is expelling a large quantity of molecular gas at ~25000 solar masses per year, as revealed by a broad component detected at 2-6 sigma in CO and [CI] ALMA observations. This object may represent the long-sought observational confirmation of outflow-driven quenching at high-z. However, the triggering mechanism of the ejection is still debated, as a result of the short integration and low resolution of pre-existent data available from ALMA. We thus request a combination of deep medium- (0.8\") and high- (0.2\") resolution observations in CO(2-1), where the ejection is detected with the highest significance, to rule out a two-galaxy merger, measure the ejection parameters (gas mass, spatial centroid, size, kinematics), and rule out whether the broad component traces a merger-driven tidal tail or a feedback-driven wind. The observations requested for this unique target caught in a critical stage of its evolution will shed light on the mechanisms halting star formation in galaxies of the distant Universe.',\n"," 'Protoplanetary Disk Masses and Grain Properties in the Orion Nebula Cluster. Rich clusters are the typical sites of star and planet formation in the Galaxy. Thus, a complete understanding of planet formation requires measuring protoplanetary disk masses in a rich cluster environment. The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the most readily-observable rich cluster. Our team has recently completed an analysis of approximately 100 protoplanetary disks with ALMA at 850 microns (Band 7) from a 1.5 x 1.5 arcminute mosaic of the inner region of the ONC. However, accurate determination of disk masses requires knowledge of the dust grain sizes, which are unconstrained with detections at only one wavelength. We will rectify this by measuring the brightness of these disks at longer wavelengths and computing their spectral indices. Thus, we propose follow-up observations at 3.1 mm (ALMA Band 3) of the same 1.5 x 1.5 arcminute region. Additionally, these longer wavelength flux measurements will more accurately reflect the total dust mass of compact disks that may be partially optically thick at 850 microns. Our observations can also reveal radial variations in grain sizes within these disks, furthering our understanding of dust growth and evolution.',\n"," 'Hot or Cold? Characterizing the temperature structure of young disks in Perseus. In contrast to protoplanetary disks, the physical and chemical conditions of young disks still embedded in their envelopes remain largely uncharacterized. An important unknown is the temperature structure since this strongly affects the disks chemical composition, and therefore the composition of planet-forming material. The more evolved protoplanetary disks have been shown to contain large cold regions where CO is frozen out onto the dust grains, but embedded disks are predicted to be too warm for CO freeze-out. Our recent analysis of the Class 0 disk L1527 suggests that this disk is indeed warm enough to prevent CO freeze-out (van t Hoff et al. 2018). We propose to investigate the temperature structure of six disk candidates in Perseus using observations of DCO+, N2D+ and DCN. Determining whether these young disks are warm or cold will show whether the onset of planet formation happens in a cold environment with CO frozen out, as observed for protoplanetary disks, or in a warm CO gas-rich environment.',\n"," 'Imaging Vibrationally-Excited Molecules in Galaxy Nuclei. We propose very high-resolution (4-11 pc) imaging of lines from vibrationally excited molecules (vib-lines) toward three prototypes of the Compact Obscured Nuclei (CON) of galaxies. A CON hides behind an enormous column of obscuring dust either a heavily Compton-thick AGN of high Eddington ratio or an extreme young, compact starburst, or both. Being radiatively excited by IR photons from hot dust, the vib-lines selectively trace the hot centers of CONs that are hardly visible in usual mm/submm lines because of (self)absorption. We aim to uncover in our targets 1) the distribution of luminosity-tracing vib-lines, 2) gas kinematics in the centers of the CONs, 3) the shapes and sizes of the continuum cores at <10 pc scale. We will then 4) constrain the nature of the CON luminosity sources using the L/M parameter measured with our observations. We use a vib-line that is strongest known, and observe galaxies that are the strongest emitters of the vib-line.',\n"," 'MOLECULAR CLOUDS AND STAR FORMATION IN BAR OF NGC1300. This proposal challenges the long-standing problem in barred galaxies that is why star formation efficiency is much smaller in bar regions than spiral arm regions. Recent high resolution numerical simulations suggest that star formation is suppressed by high velocity cloud-cloud collisions in the bar regions. Cloud collision makes cloud cores, but the high velocity collision causes too short duration for the cores to grow large enough for massive star formation via gas accretion. We detected CO(1-0) emission towards bar and arm regions of the prototype strongly barred galaxy NGC 1300 for the first time with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope. The observed emission line profiles in the bar and arm are very similar to those of the high resolution simulations, supporting this new scenario. Now we need ALMA observations to test the new scenario by identifying individual molecular cloud and deriving relative velocity distribution of the clouds. We stress that the understanding of physical cause for star formation by cloud collision is also very important to unveil galaxy evolution and formation at high redshifts.',\n"," 'Molecular clumps in a star-forming galaxy at z~1.4. We propose CO(2-1) observations of a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z~1.4, which has several molecular gas clumps in CO(5-4) emission line. Size, molecular gas mass, and velocity width of each clump are estimated to be ~4 kpc or less, ~ 50 km/s, and ~5 x 10^9 Msun, respectively, though the clump sizes are not well constrained. The clumps are considered to be important blocks to build a disk galaxy, particularly bulge. Nevertheless, presence and nature of the molecular gas clumps is not yet well known at high redshifts. Thus unveiling properties of the molecular clumps is inevitable to understand disk galaxy evolution. Since we have CO(5-4) data taken with ALMA, by combining the data, we can derive gas density and size of each clump and test whether the clumps formed via gravitational disk instability. Since CO observations of molecular clumps in a wide range of star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is still hard with ALMA, our case study will give us useful insights on formation and evolution of molecular clumps and relation to the clumps seen in other wavelengths.',\n"," 'Time Filler: Feedback Scaling Relations for Gas Infall and Outflows in Massive Starburst Galaxies at Redshifts 1.5-6. ALMA has recently demonstrated that the ground-state OH+ transitions are an ideal tracer of stellar feedback in massive starburst galaxies back to the first billion years of cosmic time based on detections in ~20 systems at redshifts 2-6. Most detections were obtained with the ACA, revealing a mix of red- and blueshifted absorption, emission, P-Cygni, and inverse P-Cygni line profiles, which are characteristic of gas infall and outflows - revealing the gas supply for the starbursts, and the feedback terminating them. These modest samples revealed relationships between the dust temperature and OH+ optical depth, and the OH+ emission strength and far-IR luminosity/star formation rate, but with substantial scatter. Here, we aim to significantly improve the statistical significance of these relations, and to identify the best cases suitable for high-resolution follow-up with the 12m array by targeting 70 of the brightest lensed starbursts across the sky from the SPT, ACT and Planck surveys, with a particular focus on less subscribed LST ranges. Given the simple selection on apparent brightness, sample completion is not essential, making this an ideal time filler project.',\n"," 'Gaia 17bpi: the circumstellar environment of a new FU Ori-type object. FU Orionis-type objects (FUors) are low-mass PMS with outbursts detected at optical and infrared wavelengths. The outbursts are caused by a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate from the circumstellar disk to the star, significantly influencing the final stellar mass. FUors can be Class I or Class II type of objects and, because the eruptions cause significant changes in their environments, it is thought that they play an important role in the transition between Classes. Only a few tens of these objects are known and our target, Gaia 17bpi, is the most recently discovered FUor. This object has not been observed at millimeter wavelengths yet, so we propose the first millimeter wavelength observations of Gaia 17bpi. We request 1.3 mm continuum observations to detect the dust in the disk and the envelope. We also request 12CO, 13CO and C18O observations which will provide information regarding the density of the envelope and can provide a detection of outflows, a common feature FUors. We will also cover a number of more complex molecules to study the chemistry in the circumstellar material.',\n"," 'Tracing the evolution of massive protostars. Recent surveys of the Galactic plane have identified large populations of candidate young massive protostars. However we have a very poor understanding of the actual evolutionary status of these sources. The SED based classification schemes used for nearby low mass objects are, alone, inadequate at the large distances of these high mass objects which are embedded in inhomogeneous environments. Here we propose the first comprehensive, systematic, high angular resolution survey of the chemical (and physical) properties of a well selected sample of 39 young high mass embedded sources. This survey will use a single frequency setting to study a range of organic molecular species which trace the evolution of the circumstellar material as a protostar initially heats its environment. The column density and excitation temperature of these species, together with the dust continuum emission, will be used to study how the properties of the circumstellar molecular gas change with source luminosity, spectral energy distribution and other properties with the goal of identifying evolutionary trends.',\n"," 'Probing the inner-most region of the relativistic jet in extreme TeV blazars. We propose to observe continuum spectrum of five extreme TeV blazars, which are unique probe to study enigmatic extragalactic background light (EBL), for the first time in mm/sub-mm regimes at two frequencies. The goal of this study is to investigate whether their relativistic jets are optically thin at mm wavelengths. Our preparatory study with ALMA shows optically thin mm-spectrum in most normal blazars, contrary to the most accepted \"one-zone SED model\" predicting their relativistic jets are optically thick in mm regime. In addition, our study with VLBI does not favor it also for extreme TeV blazars. If mm emission is optically thin in also extreme TeV blazars, it requires alternative models such as the structured jet model where both of high-energy emission and mm emission can come from the jet base. It will not only give a new picture of jets in blazars, but also affect studies on EBL based on SED models. These sources are faint for other radio interferometers. Furthermore, sequential observation in two bands is necessary for this proposal, since blazars are usually variable within days-weeks at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. Only ALMA cycle-2 can perform proposed observations.',\n"," 'The Shape of Water: Dissecting the ISM in high-redshift dusty starbursts with luminous water emission lines. H2O lines provide a unique diagnostic of the star-forming regions of high-redshift dusty galaxies. Strong gravitational lensing boosts ALMA sensitivity and angular resolution, enabling comprehensive studies of the high-redshift sources down to sub-kpc scales. Our previous studies of global H2O lines has shown that H2O emission is ubiquitously bright in submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). Our modeling shows that the H2O lines originate from highly obscured infrared-luminous regions tightly correlated with star formation. To fully unleash the diagnostic power of H2O lines, we here select the best equatorial lensed SMGs at z~2-4, and propose to image J=2,3,4 H2O lines with 0.2\"-0.3\" resolutions. Through lens models, we will be able to resolve the H2O and dust continuum emission at sub-kpc scales intrinsically. The sample will triple the total number of sources with high-resolution images of the H2O emission in dusty starbursts at any redshift. The multiple H2O lines, together with the bonus CO/[CI] lines, will allow us to further constrain the structure and properties of the heavily obscured star-forming regions and help us understand the star formation conditions in high-redshift SMGs.',\n"," 'Monitoring fast variations of event-horizon scale gas in Sgr A* with frequency switching. Sgr A* in the Galactic Center is by now the best constrained supermassive black hole candidate. Its radio spectrum peaks at submm-waves and its size as measured with VLBI experiments shrinks with increasing frequency, exhibiting a clear size-frequency relation. The Millimeter-wave emission comes from less than four Schwarzschild radii and will allow imaging of the event horizon with mmVLBI in the future. The orbital time scale in Sgr A* is 24 minutes for a Schwarzschild black hole and the source frequently flares at radio, infrared, and X-ray wavelengths on timescales of hours. VLA monitoring has shown that there is a time lag of 20 minutes between flares at lambda 7mm and lambda 13mm, consistent with an outflow model. It is predicted that a lag-frequency relation should exist extending up to the mm-regime, but so far reliable multi-frequency mm-wave monitoring is not available. Here we want to use ALMA in a frequency switching mode to establish the variability properties of Sgr A* at different frequencies on orbital time scales of the black hole. Submm emission is ideal for this, since it is optically thick emission, probing actual bulk plasma motions and densities. X-ray and IR flares are in contrast completely optically thin and hence much more sensitive to particle heating. Hence Alma monitoring may become a powerful tool for understanding Sgr A* and black holes in general. The observation should, for example, establish the lag-frequency relation, which together with the existing size-frequency relation would provide a quantitative tool to constrain flow speed and acceleration of gas within a few Schwarzschild radii of the event horizon. Finally, the integrated data set will provide the best-ever multi-frequency map of the gas streamers (Sgr A West) in the Galactic Center.',\n"," 'Characterising the dust radial segregation in the TW Hydrae protoplanetary disk. We propose to observe the well-known T Tauri star TW Hydrae in Band 3 continuum to provide the first direct measurement of dust radial migration in a disk for a single source. Comparison of SMA (870microns) and ATCA (7mm) observations of the protoplanetary disk around TW Hydra strongly suggests that the larger dust grains (> cm) are concentrated in the inner parts of the disk. ALMA offers a unique opportunity to characterise the details of the mechanisms at play: grain growth and radial migration. We propose to map the continuum emission in Band 3 (2.6mm), intermediate between 870microns and 7mm, and to do so at the same spatial scales as the SMA and ATCA data. With less than 1 hour of total observation time, we will map accurately the spatial distribution of millimeter grains, providing the first quantitative constraints on dust growth and kinematics in protoplanetary disks. These results are expected to provide very significant quantitative constraints on the dust evolution models in disks.',\n"," 'Confirming Deeply Embedded Protostellar Population in the Central Molecular Zone. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, known as the central molecular zone (CMZ), is a star-forming environment with extreme physical properties. Despite its large reservoir of dense gas, the CMZ appears to have a much lower current star formation rate than what the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation predicts. Theories have suggested an episodic star formation cycle which is at its near-minimum now. Our VLA and SMA observations towards a sample of four CMZ clouds have detected a population of protostellar candidates, traced by gravitationally bound dense cores and H2O masers. They may suggest an increase of current star formation than in the last few million years, consistent with the episodic star formation mode in the CMZ. However the existing data cannot confirm definitely the protostellar nature of these candidates. We propose to use ALMA, with its unprecedented capability of high sensitivity and high dynamic range, to observe these protostellar candidates. The project, aiming at detecting compact CH3CN emission from natal hot molecular cores, will confirm or reject the presence of embedded protostars. The new observations will provide us a vision of the episodic star formation in the CMZ.',\n"," 'Characterize the protostellar disk population in an IRDC. Protostellar disks play important roles in star formation, and their observed properties set the initial conditions for disk evolution and planet formation. To date surveys of disks in the protostellar phase are mainly limted to relatively evolved nearby regions such as Orion and Perseus, so it is largerly unexplored how the ensemble properties of protostellar disk, e.g., mass and size distributions, would vary in different environments. Here we propose to utilize the long baseline capability of ALMA to conduct a Band~7 survey towards the disk population in a distant massive infrared dark cloud (G14.19), which is in a very early stage of cluster formation. Thus the proposed observation will not only enable us to examine if disk formation undergoes similar regulation in this special physical condition, but also serve as a template and motivate large sample surveys in future.',\n"," 'Revealing the Chicken-and-Egg Problem of the Onset of the Equatorial Density Enhancement in the AGB Mass Loss. We propose to address the long-standing Chicken-and-Egg problem of the onset of the equatorial density enhancement in dusty stellar mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. Here the issue is whether the central torus is the consequence of intrinsic bipolar outflows carving out a cavity that defines the bipolar axis or the origin of bipolar outflows steered into the intrinsic biconical openings. We will confront the issue by resolving the velocity structure and the relative 12CO/13CO distribution around the central torus embedded in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of two representative proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe). We will look into how the CO outflow velocity field differs in the two PPNe having different optical morphologies, especially with respect to the latitudinal dependence of the CO ourflows. We also aim at resolving the longitudinal motion to see if the central torus exhibit the Keplerian rotation. The 12C/13C abundance ratio distribution can indicate if the wind material is in motion or in a pause, hinting at the presence of flows. Based on these pieces of dynamical evidence we will determine the role of the central torus during the AGB mass loss.',\n"," 'Calibrating Chemical Tracers of Primordial Gas in Circumstellar Disks. The lifetime of primordial gas in circumstellar disks is a fundamental quantity required for understanding planet formation processes. The uncertainties involved in relating conventional gas tracers, including dust and CO, to the total disk mass increase significantly as the disk evolves. We propose a novel approach using nitrogen-bearing species, specifically N2H+, to track primordial H2 gas. The low levels of available nitrogen incorporated into solid solar-system bodies relative to carbon suggest that nitrogen will remain present in the gas over longer timescales. Elevated N2H+/CO ratios of two Upper Sco disks observed in ALMA Cycle 3 (2015.1.01199.S) support this hypothesis. Here we propose further investigation of the N2/CO ratio at different stages of disk evolution through observations of N2H+ and HCO+ in three mature disks and one transitional disk in Upper Sco (5-11 Myr old) and one debris disk (30 Myr old) with previous CO detections by ALMA. This will provide crucial data regarding the primordial gas content of these evolved systems. Affirmative results would lead to a future survey of a large number of disks to constrain the dissipation timescale of primordial gas.',\n"," 'Cold gas in a cosmic `Spiderweb of proto-galaxies: witnessing the in-situ birth of a giant cluster elliptical?. The largest galaxies in the Universe are giant ellipticals in the cores of galaxy clusters. Simulations predict that their early evolutionary stages (in proto-clusters at z>1) are dominated by rapid gas cooling that triggers \"in-situ\" star-formation. Using ATCA and VLA, we have obtained the first tantalizing observational evidence for this scenario, by detecting and resolving an extended (~80 kpc) reservoir of cold molecular CO(1-0) gas in the massive `Spiderweb radio galaxy at z=2.2. The Spiderweb Galaxy is embedded in a rich proto-cluster and surrounded by a UV-emitting halo that harbors widespread star formation. For the first time, we identified the fuel reservoir that can sustain such widespread star formation. We here propose ALMA observations of [CI](1-0), CO(4-3) and the 600 micron dust to study the physical and chemical properties of the cold IGM across the halo. This will allow us to better understand the nature, origin and evolutionary role of the cold proto-cluster IGM. It may ultimately test theoretical predictions of how gas cooling deep inside the potential wells of high-z proto-clusters shapes the early formation of the most massive galaxies in the Universe.',\n"," 'HMSFSiO. We propose ALMA high-angular resolution and high sensitivity observations of SiO v=1, J=2-1 maser lines toward new SiO maser sources of 2 high-mass star-forming regions, G19.61-0.24A and G75.78+0.34 which are detected by the Korean VLBI Network single dish telescope. Through the ALMA observations, we investigate the exact positions and spatial distributions of SiO v=1, J=2-1 maser emission. We also expect to investigate the inner part of jets/outflows which regions are playing an important role for launching and collimating the jets/outflows probably related with rotating accretion disks close to the central protostars. In addition, the observational results of several transitions of CH3OH masers, SiO thermal emission, and continuum etc. are compared with those of SiO masers.',\n"," 'Water deuteration and abundance on a Solar System scale in the Class I source SVS13-A. Water is a crucial molecule in Solar-like star forming regions: it is among the most abundant species in the hot corino regions (where the water-rich ices sublimate as the temperature exceeds ~100 K) and its abundance govern the chemical composition of this regions. Based on the HDO/ H2O ratio, it is argued that terrestrial water was acquired from asteroids and comets whose ices were (at least partially) formed in the protostellar phase of the Solar Nebula. However, few measurements at a Solar System scale exist so far and only for Class 0 sources, so that we have no clue how water abundance and its deuteration evolve in Solar-like protostars. We aim to measure the water abundance and its deuteration in a Class I source, in the region where asteroids and comets form (a radius of ~20au). To reach this goal, we propose to obtain <0.\"2 angular resolution observations towards the only Class I source where previous single-dish observations have detected the presence of warm (150 K) deuterated water on a model-estimated size of ~50 au (Codella et al. 2016a): SVS13-A. This will allow us to strongly constrain whether the water deuteration evolves from Class 0 to Class I sources.',\n"," 'Circumplanetary Disk Masses, Sizes, and Evolution: From Case Studies to Population Statistics. Studying the accretion disks around planetary-mass companions (PMCs; M~10-30 Jupiter masses, orbits typically >100 AU) provides unique insights into the timescale of giant planet assembly and the initial conditions of exomoon formation. To date, the disks around PDS 70 c and SR 12 c are the only two circumplanetary disks detected by ALMA, indicating that deep imaging is necessary to probe disks in the planetary regime. We propose to observe 3 actively accreting PMCs in Band 7, with 3-5x greater sensitivity than previous ALMA non-detections. Multi-wavelength evidence indicates that our targets harbor disks rich in dust and gas, representing the best samples for deep ALMA imaging. We aim to increase the current census of circimplanetary disks from 2 (PDS 70 c and SR 12 c) to 5, compare disk sizes and masses with theoretical expectations, and test whether they follow the traditional scaling relationship from the stellar into the planetary regime. These deep observations may also detect CO(3-2) if PMC disks are relatively extended in gas emission. Even in the unlikely case of non-detections, we will still place stringent limits on the disk properties.',\n"," 'The interstellar medium of Hot Dust Obscured Galaxies at z = 3.1-3.6. This proposal aims to study the molecular and atomic gas properties of hot, dust-obscured galaixes (Hot DOGs). These extreme luminous galaxies, which were discovered with the WISE satellite, are rare class source characterised by a dominant hot dust component from a central obscured AGN. Analysis of the far-infrared spectral energy distribution shows the presence of a luminous cold dust component, possibly associated with starburst activity. It has been proposed that the Hot DOGs represent a short-duration transition phase from starburst- to AGN-dominated stages in the evolution of massive galaxies. We have successfully obtained CO(4-3) detections of three Hot DOGs at redshift z>3. Our results reveal massive molecular gas reservoirs of 10^10-10^11 Msun, which is similar to SMGs. More importantly, we find that all three sources show multi-component systems at <3 kpc scale. This is indicative of on-going or recent merger activity. The proposed observations of CO(7-6), CO(9-8), [CI] and [CII] will provide unique insights to the conditions in the host- and companion galaxies.',\n"," 'A kpc-scale view to the dust and gas content of typical star forming ALPINE galaxies at z~4.6. This proposal is designed to get a detailed view (up to kpc-scales) to the gas and dust content of three carefully selected normal (>0.6L*) galaxies at z~4.6. The galaxies are extracted from the ALPINE survey and they have been already detected at high signal to noise in [CII] and ~160um continuum. The galaxies are massive although follow the so-called \"main sequence\" for star forming galaxies at z~4.6. These sensitive and high resolution observations will facilitate an initial exploration of the interplay between the star-formation activity and the dynamical state on those galaxies which are part of the bulk of the galaxy population. Our main goals are: (1) to reveal the radial profiles of the gas-to-dust ratio and put them in context with galactic evolution models, (2) the exploration for the validity of the Schmidt-Kennicutt law in these \"normal\" z~4.6 galaxies, (3) use high-resolution data to prove their dynamical disk-like or merger nature, (4) explore the role that dark matter halos have in building the baryonic matter in the early Universe, and (5) identify massive clumps of star-formation and their level of stability on rotating disks.',\n"," 'How quiescent are quiescent galaxies?. How many quiescent galaxies that are selected using optical and infrared color-color cuts are dusty galaxies? To answer this question deep far-infrared/submillimeter observations are needed to unambiguously determine the dusty star formation in and around ``quiescent galaxies. Here we propose a pilot study to obtain deep ALMA band 7 observations of a carefully selected, well-defined sample of quiescent galaxies at z=2.5-3.0 in the COSMOS field. We aim to unambiguously determine the obscured star-formation rate of our target sample to a detection limit that ensures quiescence, even if they are not detected. With our proposed observations we will: determine the exact fraction of color-selected quiescent galaxies that are in fact dusty star-forming galaxies; redefine the color cuts used to seperate star-forming and quiescent systems; and derive the stellar mass function of truly quiescent galaxies at z=2.5-3.0, where significant discrepancy remains between model predictions and observations.',\n"," 'Hydronium toward PKS1830-211. We propose observations with one tuning in Band 10 to detect the absorption of hydronium (H3O+) and oxidaniumyl (H2O+) in the z=0.89 molecular absorber toward the bright lensed quasar PKS1830-211. These observations will allow us to probe the chemistry of the oxygen hydride ion family, and measure in a robust, self-consistent analysis the molecular hydrogen fraction, the cosmic-ray ionization rate of atomic hydrogen, and the electron fraction in the disk of a z=0.89 galaxy, i.e., at an epoch close to the cosmic peak of star formation rate density. We will also measure the rotation temperature of H3O+ and test the universality of formation pumping excitation. The molecular absorber toward PKS1830-211 is the only intermediate-to-high redshift object for which such a detailed chemical analysis can be done, providing a benchmark for distant star-forming galaxies.',\n"," 'Impact of a global dust storm on Martian atmosphere (retry). The most striking phenomenon on Mars is a planet-encircling storm, so-called \"global dust storm\". Once it starts, floating dust covers the whole atmosphere for more than one month, and heats up the global atmosphere via absorption of solar radiation. Our simulations predict that atmospheric temperature rises more than 20 K at 10-60 km altitude over the planet under such global dust storms and the heating also accelerates the dynamics. Moreover, theoretical studies predict the amount of CO could increase due to triboelectric field under a global dust storm. The goal of this proposal is to quantitatively evaluate how much change is induced in thermal structure, dynamics, and CO due to a global dust storm. We propose a ToO observation of 12CO and 13CO lines in Band-6 during and after a global dust storm event. Through conscious monitoring of dust opacity by Mars Express spacecraft, we can trigger to carry out the observation in real-time. In addition, this is a unique opportunity to perform joint observations with ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter. This new sensitive observation of dust-covered Martian atmosphere with ALMA will provide essential understanding in the meteorology and climate.',\n"," 'Highest Dynamic Range Spatiokinematic Mapping of an Infrared Dark Cloud. Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are the likely precursors of most star formation in our Galaxy and are thus crucial objects to characterize and understand. In particular, the relative importance of turbulence, magnetic fields and internal/external feedback remain poorly known. Here we propose ALMA 3mm observations of 13CO and C18O of a large ~10 field that will be combined with GBT-Argus data to yield the highest ever spatial dynamic range (~8 pc to 0.007 pc) ppv-cube of an IRDC (G38.95-00.47) to probe its molecular gas structure and kinematics. Kinematic methods of inferring B-field properties will be tested, including via comparison with ancillary SOFIA-HAWC+ polarimetric imaging data. We will also observe 12CO emission to trace protostellar outflows and study their influence on driving turbulence in the IRDC. Dedicated numerical simulations of molecular clouds will be developed and tested against the derived datasets, which will also be released to the community for general benchmarking of molecular cloud and star formation physics.',\n"," 'The most intrisically luminous starbursts in the Universe: witnessing the birth of the red sequence. Using all the ALMA-accessible SPIRE imaging, we have defined a sample that is both faint (ergo mostly unlensed) and extremely red (ergo very distant). We further refined this sample via SCUBA-2/LABOCA imaging, choosing only those where z_phot>4. We then demonstrated the remarkable accuracy of our refined z_phot estimates via spectral scans, and discriminated cleanly between lensed galaxies (typically <1\" Einstein rings, interesting in themselves) and intrisically luminous starbursts via our very efficient high-res band-7 continuum snapshots, discovering extraordinary examples of both. Our goals here are: 1) to identify and more than double the number of the most intrisically luminous starbursts in the z>4 Universe, galaxies that are missed by SCUBA-2 surveys due to area and by SPT due to sensitivity. We thereby pinpoint the most massive dark matter halos at these early epochs, in which we find the precursors of galaxies on the red sequence; 2) to directly characterise the physical scale and morphology of their dusty star-forming gas; 3) to robustly challenge popular models of galaxy formation via their morphologies and by determining a considerably more accurate source density.',\n"," 'High Resolution Observations of the Molecular Gas in AGN Hosted by Major Galaxy Mergers. We propose high resolution (0.05\", ~50pc) CO(2-1) observations tracing the molecular gas in the nuclear regions of 4 nearby major galaxy mergers hosting single/dual AGN. These systems trace a range in nuclear separations, and hence merger evolutionary stage, from 0.2 to 4 kpc and represent a >10x improvement in spatial resolution over existing CO data, allowing to resolve the structure of the molecular gas inside the sphere of influence of each supermassive black hole (SMBH) and study individual giant molecular clouds in the circumnuclear medium. Our main scientific goals are: (i) trace the molecular gas dynamics in regions well inside the SMBHs sphere of influence, (ii) study nuclear molecular outflows driven by the SMBH growth, and (iii) measure the amount of gas and kinematics of the gas reservoir for each SMBH in connection to current and future SMBH growth. By sampling both single and dual AGN in similar merger stages, we will study possible structural differences in the gas fueling SMBHs, explaining their contrasting accretion rates. In future cycles more systems will be studied, to draw statistical conclusions once more ALMA high resolution time is available.',\n"," 'Observing Jets and Outflows in Tidal Disruption Events with ALMA. Transient accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) through the tidal disruption of a stray star offers a unique opportunity to study the birth and evolution of relativistic jets and to probe the environment around previously dormant SMBHs on sub-parsec scales. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have long been predicted to produce optical/UV/soft X-ray transient emission from the newly-formed accretion disk, but in the past few years we have shown that some TDEs can also launch relativistic jets and broad outflows, which generate synchrotron emission that peaks in the mm on timescales of days to weeks. To address the open question of jet and outflow formation requires: (i) a larger sample of TDEs from a diverse range of selection methods, and (ii) deep mm follow-up, only possible with ALMA. Here, we propose to observe up to 4 new TDE candidates with triggers from gamma-ray, X-ray, or optical surveys (Swift, Fermi, XMM-Newton Slew Survey, Pan-STARRS, CRTS, DES, ASAS-SN, ZTF). Our mm observations will be sensitive to both non-relativistic outflows and relativistic jets and will constrain jet formation models and rate predictions, which are currently highly uncertain.',\n"," 'ALMA Follow-Up of NS-NS/NS-BH mergers from LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3. The first direct detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger led to the discovery of an electromagnetic counterpart, ushering in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. The GW data can shed light on the nature of compact object mergers, providing sensitive tests of General Relativity and insight into the neutron star equation of state. However, these goals can only be achieved via the joint detection of EM counterparts, which provide the necessary astrophysical context. Here we propose ALMA observations of up to three new GW events containing a neutron star during LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3 (Dec 2018-Dec 2019). We will trigger ALMA immediately following the identification of an EM counterpart to search for and characterize relativistic outflows. ALMA observations are critical for breaking model degeneracies inherent to X-ray/cm data, and will delineate the early stages of the outflow when the emission is self-absorbed at cm wavelengths. These observations will pave the way for characterizations of non-thermal emission from GW sources, providing the first ever millimeter detections of GW counterparts.',\n"," 'Gravity vs B-field in massive-star forming clouds: Who is in the driving seat?. The details of what physical processes (between turbulence, gravity, or magnetic field) regulates the mass transfer from the large scales of clouds and filaments onto the small scales of clumps and cores is still highly debated. The origin of such a debate resides in our (past) inability to track the magnetic (B) field properties over such a large range of scales and densities that are involved in the star formation process. Here, we propose to use ALMA to map, on a few thousand AU scale, the B-field morphology and gas velocity field towards the massive-star forming infrared dark cloud G34. Combined with our large-scale study of the region, these new observations will provide, for the first time, a complete picture of energy balance in a massive-star forming cloud.',\n"," 'Measuring vertical settling and radial drift of dust: A survey of young edge-on disks. We propose to observe a well-defined sample of Edge-On Disks to study the radial and vertical distribution of the dust. Scattered light images of edge-on disks like HH 30 have established what we think is typical for the shape and flaring of protoplanetary disks. However, these conclusions are correct only for the small grains, i.e. the near-IR scattering opacity carriers, but are very likely incorrect for the larger dust particles emitting at longer wavelengths. The large particles are expected to be distributed differently in particular because of dust settling, but so far we are still missing direct images that would reveal the vertical stratification of dust of all sizes in T Tauri disks. ALMA cycle-4 offers the perfect opportunity (resolution, sensitivity), and the edge-on geometry allows for direct conclusions beyond doubt. By comparing the gas distribution to the distributions of small and large dust grains, we can draw definite conclusions about the disk shape, and the settling and radial migration of solids with unprecedented details. All are key issues for a better understanding of the physical and chemical processes during the early stages of planet formation.',\n"," 'A Direct Test of the Possible Connection Between Fast Radio Bursts and Superluminous Supernovae. The first precise localization of a fast radio burst (FRB121102) led to two unexpected results: (i) a low metallicity dwarf host galaxy, and (ii) a spatially coincident quiescent radio counterpart. The host galaxy is identical to the hosts of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), a rare type of core-collapse SNe powered by magnetars, while the quiescent radio source is a nebula associated with the FRB. In a recent paper we argued that these results indicate that FRB121102 is powered by a millisecond magnetar born in a SLSN explosion ~30 years ago. A strong prediction of this model is that known SLSNe that are a few years old should also exhibit nebulae, but with a peak in the mm-band. Here we propose to carry out the first such search, targeting a complete sample of all SLSNe (18 sources) that are >1.5 years old, located at z<0.5, and are visible to ALMA; these cuts lead to an expected flux density of >0.1 mJy at 100 GHz. Detections of associated nebulae will have profound implications for our understanding of both FRBs and SLSNe, while non-detections will invalidate our proposed model. We will couple the ALMA results to our modeling of the optical/UV data of the SLSNe.',\n"," 'Evolution of ISM Masses in the First 2 Gyr at z = 3 - 6. We propose to extend our very successful ALMA survey of the ISM contents of galaxies out to the epoch of reionization and initial galaxy formation at z = 3 to 6. In this epoch, the ISM masses generally dominate over stellar masses, thus determining early galaxy formation and evolution. Our observations will probe the ISM masses using the long wavelength Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) dust continuum emission with ALMA continuum observations tailored to maintain lambda_rest > 300 microns and detections at 5-10 sigma based on the expected fluxes of each galaxy. Two samples at z = 3 - 6 that cover a range of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs will be observed: 21 main sequence galaxies from the ALMA Cycle 5 large project ALPINE, and a sample of 7 starburst galaxies having existing Herschel far infrared detections. All galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts and infrared SFRs (from ALPINE 150 mic continuum detection or from Herschel). Dynamical mass estimates are available from the ALPINE [CII] line imaging, providing a powerful calibration of the mass estimates; ALPINE provides the largest galaxy sample with [CII] detected galaxies at z > 4 to date.',\n"," 'Confimation of Blindly Detected [CII]158um emitter candidates at z = 6.0 and 6.5. In order to obtain the first conclusive evidence of blind detections of millimeter emission line sources, we propose follow-up observations of blindly detected two [CII]158um emitter candidates at z=6.0 and 6.5 in ALMA Deep Field in SSA22. In the previous observation, the candidates show S/N ratios of 6.5 and 6.2 sigma. They are faint in far-infrared, optical to near-infrared wavebands. For confirmation of the blind detections and determination of their redshifts, our proposal here is observation targeting the detected [CII] line emissions at band 6 and CO(6-5) emission lines at band 3 with the setting of 0\".7 angular resolution to maximize sensitivity. The total observing time is 15.3 hours. Our proposing science goals are: (1) Confirmation of discovery of new galaxy population which are faint in both of optical/far-infrared continuum (2) Revealing gaseous properties of the new galaxy population at z ~ 6 (3) Estimation of star-formation rates and molecular gas masses of high-redshift normal [CII] emitters (4) Cosmic star-formation rate density and, at the first time, molecular gas mass density at z = 6.2.',\n"," 'Dust growth in protoplanetary disks: where in the disk are grains growing?. The first step toward planet formation is the growth of submicron grains into centimeter-sized particles inside a circumstellar disk. The long-wavelength emission from large dust is the last observable link in the growth chain from interstellar dust grains to fully fledged planets. Thus, observations of this phase provide crucial constraints to theories of early planetesimal growth and of the transport and evolution of dust particles. In this proposal we request ALMA observations at 1.3 mm, that when combined with our existing 0.7 - 1 cm spatially resolved observations, will determine where in the disk are dust grains preferentially growing. With careful characterization of the disk thermal and density structure we can determine the dust optical depth and constrain the dust emissivity index throughout the disk. These ALMA observations will establish if spatial variations of grain growth occur in nature, as it is expected from several theoretical scenarios, like particle trapping at pressure maxima arising from vortices, turbulence, or Rossby-wave instabilities.',\n"," 'Quantifying the molecular gas reservoirs of post-starburst AGN hosts. ALMA observations of a single recently-quenched AGN host at z~0.6 revealed dramatic and unexpected CO(2-1) emission despite suppressed star formation: >10^10.5Msun of molecular gas stretches tens of kpc out from the galaxys center. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is often invoked to shut down star formation-- with this unique galaxy, ALMA may have caught AGN in the act. However, this single object is insufficient to build a statistical link between AGN activity, molecular outflows, and quenching. Here we propose observations of six additional post-starburst AGN hosts from the same parent sample. These galaxies are ideal ALMA targets: they have existing optical spectroscopy and deep high-resolution imaging, and we expect to detect gas given their young stellar ages. We will quantify the fraction of post-starburst AGN hosts that have molecular gas on extended spatial scales, then test whether the gas properties correlate with AGN luminosity, time since quenching, or the location of optical tidal features. This analysis will help pin down the role of AGN in quenching.',\n"," 'Resolving Structure in the Planet Forming Regions of the Compact Binary Protostar GV Tau. GV Tau is a young binary system whose central protostars are each surrounded by a protoplanetary disk which has been estimated to be unusually massive and compact. If the mass estimates are correct, GV Tau N & S may be the first disks known to have sufficient material within their planet forming regions to form giant planets. Their estimated >0.01 solar masses within 30 AU make them potentially true Minimum Mass Solar Nebula equivalents. Furthermore, there is some evidence that dust grain growth and planet formation may already be significantly advanced in these disks. We propose to use ALMA to, for the first time, resolve the compact protoplanetary disks around the GV Tau protostars and determine their structures and masses. We will also use multi-wavelength ALMA observations to constrain dust opacity and particle sizes within the disks, and spatially and spectrally resolve Keplerian rotation in the disks and measure dynamical masses of the protostars. This project will be an interesting case study of a young binary system whose protoplanetary disks may represent the first known analogs of our own primordial Solar System.',\n"," 'The molecular ISM and dust emission of extremely red quasars at high spatial resolution.. Feedback from accreting supermassive black holes is now a standard ingredient in galaxy formation models. It may be necessary to recreate the steep high-mass end of the stellar mass function and establish the black-hole/bulge correlations. We request ALMA observations to map the distribution and kinematics of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) and star formation activity in near-Eddington red quasars at z~2.5 with extreme (>> 1000 km/s) outflow activity well beyond that seen at any redshift among any quasar sample. We will observe the CO (7-6) and [CI] 2-1 emission lines and the rest-frame 375 micron dust continuum at 1-2 kpc resolution. We will search for and measure the energetics of the molecular outflows and map their location relative to the ongoing star formation activity. The selected targets will be observed with JWST NIRSpec IFU to map galactic scale ionized gas kinematics and dynamics. ALMA and NIRSpec observations will allow us to measure the location of the fast-moving (>> 1000 km/s) ionized outflows relative to the molecular ISM and star formation activity to gauge the impact of the powerful outflows on star formation activity and the molecular gas reservoir.',\n"," 'Extreme scattering due to cometary globules. Intra-day variability (IDV) and extreme scattering events (ESEs) occur when galactic screens of ionized gas intervene between Earth and a distant point-like radio emitter, causing refractive scattering. We have recently discovered that these phenomena occur in very close proximity to local, hot stars, and that the scattering plasma is found in radial filaments. We expect that these filaments are primarily made up of cold gas with a thin skin of plasma, allowing these scattering screens to be long-lived. These proposed observations aim to observe CO emission from this cold gas surrounding the nearby star Spica, towards a quasar currently displaying large, rapid amplitude modulation. A detection here will greatly improve our understanding of star formation and galaxy dynamics, as these molecular clouds may make up a large fraction of galactic dark matter.',\n"," 'CONICS: Cosmic Noon ISM Conditions Survey. The COsmic Noon ISM Conditions Survey (CONICS) is a comprehensive survey of the mass and conditions in the cold interstellar medium (ISM) of 11 star-forming galaxies during the peak of cosmic star formation (z=2-3). Carefully drawn from optically-selected CO(3-2) surveys, these galaxies form the largest representative sample of star-forming galaxies at this epoch and benefit from exquisite multi-wavelength data. With only two tunings, we will efficiently measure the CO(4-3)+[CI](1-0) and CO(7-6)+[CI](2-1) emission and underlying dust continuum in Bands 4 and 6, providing a homogeneous dataset that is sufficient to constrain the latest generation of radiative transfer models of the cold medium. This program will provide fundamental insights into the boundary conditions for star formation during the peak of the cosmic star formation history by measuring (i) the total mass in cold gas and dust (ii) the physical conditions in the cold molecular medium (e.g., temperature, density). Building on years of investments with ALMA and NOEMA, CONICS will provide the most comprehensive survey of the gas masses and ISM conditions in galaxies at cosmic noon to date.',\n"," 'Unveiling a Massive Node of the Cosmic Web at z=3. Galaxies form and evolve within the diffuse filaments of the Cosmic Web. Direct imaging of these filaments has for long remained elusive leaving many questions open: How do galaxies get their gas? What is the morphology and kinematics of accreting gas and how does this affect the gas content and star formation activity of galaxies? A recent MUSE survey around a z=3 quasar has finally provided one of the first images of contiguous cosmic filaments on Mpc-scales converging into a node containing a large galaxy concentration and the only known close-separation triple AGN at high-z. Because highly-star-forming galaxies are typically dust-obscured, the MUSE data gives a partial view of the galaxy distribution within and around filaments. To overcome this limitation we propose ALMA dust-continuum and CO mosaic observations in order to: i) obtain a complete census of highly-star-forming and dust-obscured galaxies in the field, ii) measure and correlate the gas content of galaxies with the density and kinematics of filaments in order to understand how galaxies get their gas, iii) reveal the morphological and kinematical properties of the gas component of galaxies within the Cosmic Web node',\n"," 'The Warm/Dense Circumnuclear Disk and Black Hole Mass of Centaurus A. In powerful radio-galaxies the properties of the circumnuclear gas from hundred parsecs down to the accretion disk are hitherto poorly understood. Cen~A is by far the closest giant elliptical and powerful radio galaxy, and is the key to understanding molecular gas properties and the feeding mechanisms in the entire class of powerful radio galaxies. Although it is known that gas with a wide range of temperatures and densities are found to co-exist in the r < 200 pc circumnuclear gas of Cen~A, we still do not have high resolution information of the warm and dense gas. We aim to probe such material via CO(3-2), CO(6-5) with 5 pc resolution, as well as HCO+ and HCN(1-0) with 10 pc resolution, in a mosaic encompassing the inner circumnuclear disk (r<200pc). We will study 1) the distribution and kinematics of such warm and dense molecular gas, especially in an inner gap at r < 80 pc found in our lower resolution CO(2-1) data, 2) probe the physical mechanisms feeding the active galactic nuclei, and 3) obtain a measure of the mass of the supermassive black hole.',\n"," 'A Pilot Study of Warm Molecular Gas in High-redshift Obscured Quasars. We request ACA observations of the CO(J=7-6) transition in a small sample of 5 high-redshift (z>~3), hyper-luminous (Lbol > 10^14 Lsun), dust-obscured quasars for which at least two other lower-J CO line transitions have already been detected with ALMA and VLA. This is a pilot program motivated by the surprisingly bright detection of the CO(J=12-11) transition in the most luminous obscured quasar known, W2246-0526, which suggests that it is possible to detect mid-J CO transitions in these extreme objects using the ACA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) to start investigating the excitation properties of the warm molecular gas in high-z obscured quasars and place them in context with other dusty galaxy populations, and (2) to determine whether the CO(J=7-6) line, which has recently been proposed as a good star formation rate indicator, can be truly used in galaxies with such extreme environments. This will be the first time that such a study is conducted in this new population of high-z quasars.',\n","
