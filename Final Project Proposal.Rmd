# Abstract
The ALMA Observatory in Chile is the largest astronomical project in existence, and is open to anyone in the world to use. The aim of this project is to streamline the proposal process for astronomers who use ALMA. The Capstone team will develop an algorithm that suggests the optimal technical setup based on the text that an astronomer specifies in their proposal. More than 4000 projects have been undertaken in the first 10 years of ALMA operations, and all projects are visible (with all metadata, and about 90% of the scientific data available) via the user interface of the ALMA Science Archive: [https://almascience.nrao.edu/aq/](https://almascience.nrao.edu/aq/).


# Project Outline
The aim of this project is to streamline the proposal process for astronomers who use ALMA. The Capstone team will develop an algorithm that suggests the optimal technical setup based on the text that an astronomer specifies in the proposal, specifically the title and abstract. The metadata for these projects can be used to train and test the model. The primary goal will be to optimize the frequency ranges to be observed simultaneously in a project. Additional technical setup requirements can be explored, if there is time and interest among the group. As astronomers can spend weeks preparing these proposals, and we suspect that the technical setup is not always optimized, important outcomes of this project include an immense time-savings for astronomers around the world, as well as a more efficient usage of the ALMA telescope for observations of the Universe. The stakeholders in this project include sponsor Adele Plunkett, the NRAO, ALMA Observatory, astronomers utilizing ALMA, and UVA capstone students.


# Outline of the Data

The data has been collected over the course of 10 years, from the use of the ALMA observatory. It has been sourced from previous studies utilizing the antennas. This includes the abstract of the experiments along with the positioning of the antennas (e.g., right ascension, declination, and band focus). If needed, full proposal data can be accessed, however this data is not publicly available until a year after the proposal is accepted.
  
## Target variables:
* Document feature extraction based on titles and abstracts for proposal clustering
* Array frequency ranges
  * Each observation in the data includes the frequency ranges used to observe spectral signatures of objects in space
  * Each observation for the array must fall within certain observable frequency bands and specific frequency ranges within those bands relate to the observable signatures of molecules
  * We will attempt to recommend the optimal frequency band and range based on similar research proposals, maximizing the importance and/or number of interesting frequency ranges and molecules to observe

# Assumptions and Limitations

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Identifier} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Limitation & There is no set or efficient way to measure the accuracy or success of our model, unless we make a train/test split on the data. Since there is not a lot of data we need to be conscientious about the size of the split to optimize training information and testing capability. \\
    \hline
    Limitation & Title and abstract may not be sufficient for model training, this may require full proposal text for better accuracy, however, proposal text is not publicly available \\
    \hline
    Assumption & The project data can be “labeled” in order to cluster/develop a model to suggest frequency setups \\
    \hline
    Assumption & Additional metadata, e.g. keyword, can be used to assist model performance, keyword data only available at proposal submission. This is to say we will not have these keywords immediately, but maybe we can ask users for them during proposal submission \\
    \hline
    Assumption & There is not one single “correct” tuning per proposal — multiple tunings could work depending on researchers’ preferences \\
    \hline

## Initial Model Steps:
* A language model which extracts features from the research proposal
* A clustering model to group similar features from the language model and recommend optimal or frequently used “settings” for accurate positioning of antennas and to optimize frequency support

## Raw Data:
* Abstract and titles of studies, keywords, positioning of antennas (right ascension, declination, band, continuum sensitivity, frequency support, etc.)
* All the data is easily accessible via [https://almascience.nrao.edu/aq/](https://almascience.nrao.edu/aq/), and can be queried into a jupyter notebook or python script using the ALminer package [https://alminer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://alminer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 
## Target variables:
* Feature extraction from proposal language processing
* Frequency ranges for similar research proposals

## Potential predictor variables:
* Project title and abstract (possibly full project text)
* Keywords related to proposal

## Possible challenges:
* Somewhat small sample of project abstracts/ titles, limiting train/test opportunities (roughly 4000)

# Outline of Modeling Approaches

The project will require implementing and deploying a natural language processing model, using simple approaches for initial models with the possibility of moving on to more complicated packages and implementations later on. This is a new topic for all of us, so this will require a review of current literature. The second half of our project will involve using NLP as dimensionality reduction to certain features, which we can then use in a clustering type approach to recommend the optimal frequency support for the project.

Based on modeling success, we may have to consider spectral tunings as a group versus individual rank-ordered or preference recommendations.


# Potential Concerns and Blockers

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{10cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Identifier} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \hline
    Concern & No immediate experience or knowledge of NLP \\
    \hline
    Concern & Technical knowledge of frequency setups, general knowledge of data and proposals \\
    \hline
    Blocker & Archives go down periodically. There are three mirrors of the archives, so we may have to change which server we are sourcing data from. This amounts to changing the URL used in ALminer or other data accessing platform. Max expected downtime is 1 hour. \\
