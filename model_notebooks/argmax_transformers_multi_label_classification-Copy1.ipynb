    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be fine tuning a transformer model for the **Multilabel text classification** problem.\n",
    "This is one of the most common business problems where a given piece of text/sentence/document needs to be classified into one or more of categories out of the given list. For example a movie can be categorized into 1 or more genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flow of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will be divided into seperate sections to provide a organized walk through for the process used. This process can be modified for individual use cases. The sections are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Importing Python Libraries and preparing the environment](#section01)\n",
    "2. [Importing and Pre-Processing the domain data](#section02)\n",
    "3. [Preparing the Dataset and Dataloader](#section03)\n",
    "4. [Creating the Neural Network for Fine Tuning](#section04)\n",
    "5. [Fine Tuning the Model](#section05)\n",
    "6. [Validating the Model Performance](#section06)\n",
    "7. [Saving the model and artifacts for Inference in Future](#section07)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "This script leverages on multiple tools designed by other teams. Details of the tools used below. Please ensure that these elements are present in your setup to successfully implement this script.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Data:\n",
    "\t - We are using the Jigsaw toxic data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "     - This is competion provide the souce dataset [Toxic Comment Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)\n",
    "\t - We are referring only to the first csv file from the data dump: `train.csv`\n",
    "\t - There are rows of data.  Where each row has the following data-point:\n",
    "\t\t - Comment Text\n",
    "\t\t - `toxic`\n",
    "\t\t - `severe_toxic`\n",
    "\t\t - `obscene`\n",
    "\t\t - `threat`\n",
    "\t\t - `insult`\n",
    "\t\t - `identity_hate`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each comment can be marked for multiple categories. If the comment is `toxic` and `obscene`, then for both those headers the value will be `1` and for the others it will be `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Language Model Used:\n",
    "\t - BERT is used for this project. It was the transformer model created by the Google AI Team.  \n",
    "\t - [Blog-Post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html)\n",
    "\t - [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)\n",
    "     - [Documentation for python](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "***NOTE***\n",
    "- *It is to be noted that the outputs to the BERT model are different from DistilBert Model implemented by the Hugging Face team. There are no `token_type_ids` generated from the tokenizer in case of Distilbert and also the final outputs from the network differ.*\n",
    "- *This will be explained further in the notebook*\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " - Hardware Requirements:\n",
    "\t - Python 3.6 and above\n",
    "\t - Pytorch, Transformers and All the stock Python ML Libraries\n",
    "\t - GPU enabled setup\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Script Objective:\n",
    "\t - The objective of this script is to fine tune BERT to be able to label a comment  into the following categories:\n",
    "\t\t - `toxic`\n",
    "\t\t - `severe_toxic`\n",
    "\t\t - `obscene`\n",
    "\t\t - `threat`\n",
    "\t\t - `insult`\n",
    "\t\t - `identity_hate`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "***NOTE***\n",
    "- *It is to be noted that the overall mechanisms for a multiclass and multilabel problems are similar, except for few differences namely:*\n",
    "\t- *Loss function is designed to evaluate all the probability of categories individually rather than as compared to other categories. Hence the use of `BCE` rather than `Cross Entropy` when defining loss.*\n",
    "\t- *Sigmoid of the outputs calcuated to rather than Softmax. Again for the reasons defined in the previous point*\n",
    "\t- *The [accuracy metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html) and [F1 scores](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) used from sklearn package as compared to direct comparison of expected vs predicted*\n",

This is needed because all the data from the dataset cannot be loaded to the memory at once, hence the amount of dataloaded to the memory and then passed to the neural network needs to be controlled.\n",

    " - We will be creating a neural network with the `BERTClass`.\n",
    " - This network will have the `Bert` model.  Follwed by a `Droput` and `Linear Layer`. They are added for the purpose of **Regulariaztion** and **Classification** respectively.\n",
    " - In the forward loop, there are 2 output from the `BertModel` layer.\n",
    " - The second output `output_1` or called the `pooled output` is passed to the `Drop Out layer` and the subsequent output is given to the `Linear layer`.\n",
    " - Keep note the number of dimensions for `Linear Layer` is **6** because that is the total number of categories in which we are looking to classify our model.\n",
    " - The data will be fed to the `BertClass` as defined in the dataset.\n",
    " - Final layer outputs is what will be used to calcuate the loss and to determine the accuracy of models prediction.\n",
    " - We will initiate an instance of the network called `model`. This instance will be used for training and then to save the final trained model for future inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss Function and Optimizer\n",
    " - The Loss is defined in the next cell as `loss_fn`.\n",
    " - As defined above, the loss function used will be a combination of Binary Cross Entropy which is implemented as [BCELogits Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#bcewithlogitsloss) in PyTorch\n",
    " - `Optimizer` is defined in the next cell.\n",
    " - `Optimizer` is used to update the weights of the neural network to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Further Reading\n",
    "- You can refer to my [Pytorch Tutorials](https://github.com/abhimishra91/pytorch-tutorials) to get an intuition of Loss Function and Optimizer.\n",
