imbhs or highly dense clusters mainly consisting of dark stellar remnants such as neutron stars and stellar mass bhs here we propose high resolution arcsec molecular line and continuum observations toward the gas streams in band and the principal objective is to probe mass distribution of the putative gravitational sources and examine the imbh hypothesis by investigating the detailed kinematics and physical conditions of the streams we also aim to resolve mysterious ultra compact d pc clumps with extremely broad velocity widths dv km s located around the two imbh candidates this project would potentially fill the missing link between stellar mass bhs and smbhs contributing to further understanding of galactic evolution',\n"," 'pillars of destruction probing cloud destruction and triggered star formation in the pillars of carina ionised feedback from high mass stars destroys molecular clouds removing the reservoir for further star formation and restricting star formation efficiency to a few percent irradiated pillars are a key signpost of this process with simulations suggesting they are either a revealed pre existing filaments or b formed during cloud destruction via instabilities star formation may also be enhanced suppressed or merely revealed during this process despite the importance of these processes to the star formation life cycle they are still poorly constrained with only one pioneering study klaassen et al testing the different theoretical pillar formation scenarios via high resolution observations of the cold gas kinematics in a single pillar guided by our proof of concept study we propose to observe pillar regions in carina with the aca to systematically study the effects of feedback the sample includes pillars with a range of lengths and

'molecular outflows in dusty gravitionally lensed qsos at z outflows are crucially important for the gas budget and evolution of luminous star forming galaxies and agns qsos the most luminous agns are believed to responsible for quenching star formation in the most massive galaxies this suggests dusty qsos are currently in a transition phase the small fraction of star forming galaxies identified as as a qso indicates this is a short myr and extremely explosive phase at the peak of star formation and agn accretion at z such outflows must play a major role but become extremely difficult to observe in co in cycle we carried out a very successful pilot project to test oh as a tracer of high z outflows oh is a sensitive outflow tracer in local ir luminous galaxies and lies close to co so that both lines can be observed in one tuning the oh line is detected in absorption blueshifted with respect to the co which measures the warm gas in the disk in this pilot study we aim to test the feasibility of detecting molecular outflows with oh in dusty qsos at z to compare with outflows in dsfgs at the same redshift and investigate the mass outflow rate and agn luminosity relationship seen at low redshift',\n"," 'inheritance or reset probing accretion shocks with so and so is the gas and ice composition in the planet esimal formation zone of disks largely inherited from the pre stellar core or has it been reset one of the biggest uncertainties in answering this question is knowing whether or not the material undergoes a strong accretion shock as it enters the disk high resolution au images can potentially trace this shock and distinguish it from disk winds or jets outflows through observations of suitable molecular tracers so and so are two particularly well suited molecules since their emission has been observed to originate at the disk envelope interface and they are known shock tracers we here propose to image both molecules in multiple lines to constrain excitation using a single band setting at much higher spatial resolution than done previously for the case of so to search for evidence of accretion shocks that reset the gas and ice chemistry combination with approved vlt muse and jwst miri data will help to further pin down the physical and chemical processing at the envelope disk outflow interface',\n"," 'internal structure of a proto brown dwarf we propose high angular resolution and high sensitivity observations with to conduct a pilot study of the internal structure of a bona fide proto brown dwarf proto bd we will observe the hco and hcn lines which are the brightest ones detected in the proto bd from previous iram m observations we have derived self consistent physical chemical models that can reproduce the observed molecular line emission and provide a first order approximation to the internal structure of the proto bd the models predict that the hco and hcn species provide a contrasting view of the internal structure in a proto bd such that hcn can reveal the small scale structures in regions where hco is depleted high sensitivity interferometric observations at a high angular resolution of can confirm the predictions from our physical chemical model on how the different physical components envelope outflow disk contribute to the emergent molecular line intensity in a proto bd this will be a pioneering study with to understand the chemical inhomogeneities and the removal and survival of molecular species from the gas phase in different layers of a proto bd core',\n"," 'imaging high velocity neutral gas around an intermediate mass black hole candidate we propose subarcsec resolution wide field imaging of co which is a peculiar compact cloud with an extremely broad velocity width dv km s found in the central molecular zone of our galaxy our main goals are to determin the molecular gas kinematics in this cloud probe ultra high velocity neutral gas and thereby confirm the existence of an invisible massive m e msun object within the cloud our target co will be fully mapped in hcn j and ci ghz lines at linear resolutions of pc and pc respectively these data sets will be combined with those obtained with the aste m telescope to recover spatially extended emission this project is going to reveal unprecedented details of this peculiar molecular cloud which constrain the size of the putative massive object within the cloud allowing us to examine whether the invisible object is an intermediate mass black hole',\n"," 'revisiting the slope of black hole scaling relations for spiral galaxies the evolution of massive black holes mbh and their host galaxies appear to be closely connected as several tight scaling relations suggest it is still debated what exact evolutionary path galaxies of different morphology follow sahu et al compiled mbh masses derived from different dynamical tracers and showed that early type and late type galaxies etg ltgs follow scaling relations with very different slopes when only using the subset of mbh masses derived from cold gas we noticed that the ltgs significantly deviated from the sahu et al relations we propose to use observations to derive robust dynamical measurements of mbh masses in a sample of nearby ltgs the high resolution of observations will map the kinematics of the rotating nuclear molecular gas disk resolve the black holes sphere of influence and allow us to measure the mbh mass precisely our measurements will provide new constraints on the slope of the ltg scaling relations and the cause of the mentioned discrepancy on the pitch angle mbh scaling relation as diagnostic tool for low mass ltgs and on the secular evolution of ltgs with respect to their central black hole',\n"," 'dynamical flow process of a torus testing a radiation driven fountain model in circinus we try to test one of the physically motivated torus mode radiation driven fountain model towards the nearest type seyfert circinus galaxy from mir interferometric observations circinus has proven to have polar elongated dust emission that is typical for the fountain model wada we will try to reveal the geometrical and kinematic structure of the circumnuclear region of circinus with co and ci emission lines co will probe the dense mid plane of the disk whereas ci will do rather diffuse component especially we expect that co is x ray dissociated at the close vicinity to the agn hence we should use atomic lines such as ci to probe the agn driven dusty outflow that is the key component of the fountain model',\n"," 'is atomic carbon a good tracer of h gas impacts of cosmic ray and or shock induced destructions of co atomic carbon line emission ci is believed to be a good tracer for deducing the h distribution in galaxies and one that can be as reliable as the low j co line emission however it is not fully understood how the ci h abundance ratio is modified under the interstellar environment where cosmic ray induced and or shock destructions of co molecules occur efficiently we here propose to observe ci p p co j and co j line emission toward the pre and post shocked molecular clouds in the galactic supernova remnant snr rcw we will distinguish the two effects by observing the spatial variations of ci co abandance ratio the high ci co values due to the shock destruction of co can be seen only in the post shocked layer whereas cosmic ray induced destructions will affect both the pre and post shocked clouds owing to their energy dependent diffusions this proposed observation will unveil the behavior of ci under the peculiar interstellar environments and verify its suitability as a tracer for h ',\n"," 'hd as a powerful tool to trace gas flows in primordial galaxies gas flows are recognised to be fundamental processes driving galaxy evolution observationally gas outflows and inflows in galaxies are very difficult to probe and in particular their molecular phase this is even more difficult in primordial galaxies since steep metallicity evolution makes traditional molecular tracers even more unreliable the transition of deuteriated molecular hydrogen especially if seen in absorption is potentially a perfect tracer of the column of molecular hydrogen completely independent of metallicity and of gas excitation through a cycle programme we have recently obtained the first detection of hd in absorption in a lensed galaxy at z this is a truly revolutionary discovery in this system hd is tracing both outflowing and inflowing gas with unprecedented accuracy we hereby propose to followup on this discovery to map hd absorption with higher sensitivity and higher angular resolution throughout the entire lensed galaxy hence providing the most detailed picture of the outflowing and inflowing gas in a primordial galaxy we also propose to target two additional water transitions to constrain the physics of the outflowing gas',\n"," 'unexpected acceleration of the zonal wind in the martian middle atmosphere recent observation has revealed an unexpected high abundance of water vapor in the martian middle atmosphere that supposedly drives the enhancement of the atmospheric hydrogen escape however it is unclear how to extract water vapor from the lower atmosphere water vapor is trapped below the cold trap altitude and place it in the middle atmosphere although our recent study has proposed that an inflation of the lower atmosphere associated with intensified meridional circulation can transport water vapor effectively to upper altitudes the complete picture is not yet confirmed due to the lack of the direct observations of the atmospheric circulation i e wind we propose a new measurement to capture the vertical profiles of the mesospheric wind for the first time using comprehensive multi lines observations by in addition our ir heterodyne observation can complement the wind measurements in the upper mesosphere also satellite observations by maven and tgo will observe the resultant thermal structure and water vapor aerosol distribution in the mesosphere',\n"," 'ci may trace h better than co a sensitive test on molecular outflows we propose high sensitivity observations of the ci p p co and cs emission lines in the local agn host lirg ngc we aim to explore the capability of the ci line to trace the bulk of h gas both in the outflow and in the star forming disk of ngc and in particular of its most diffuse and coldest phase and compare it to the more commonly employed co and co gas tracers our analysis will have a great legacy value for future high redshift studies because at z the lowest j co transitions are not observable with we will also investigate the denser phase of h through the cs line and examine whether the outflow entrains high density gas which is the primary fuel for star formation the recent discovery that star formation powered cosmic rays can very effectively destroy co but not h makes the proposed observations even more promising since cosmic rays escape from star forming disks and are expected to do so preferentially along the directions of the powerful h outflows',\n"," 'measuring magnetic field morphologies in disks using the gk effect polarimetric observations and theoretical modeling indicate that we cannot measure the magnetic field morphology in circumstellar disks via sub millimeter polarization continuum observations the zeeman effect is also very difficult to observe toward circumstellar disks and does not provide the plane of sky field morphology one other promising way to measure the magnetic field morphology in the plane of the sky is via line polarization the goldreich kylafis gk effect suggests that line polarization is perpendicular or parallel to magnetic field direction we propose to observe line polarization toward the disks im lup and hd these observations will tell us whether the gk effect can measure the magnetic field morphology in disks',\n"," 'resolved distribution and dynamics of molecular gas of a distant spiral galaxy we propose to detect the co emission line in a moderate redshift galaxy z to infer the gas distribution and velocity field at a resolution of arcsec kpc the immediate objective of this pilot study is to determine the shape and amplitude of the rotation curve out to two disk scalelengths this would be the first time that a gaseous rotation curve is obtained for a supposedly distant unperturbed disk a second objective is then to compare the co kinematics with the optical oii doublet kinematics observed in by means of vlt giraffe observations of the same galaxy the observations will be times more resolved than the giraffe data and allow us to assess whether the velocity plateau used for the tully fisher relation from giraffe is correct resolved observations of distant galaxies would open a new window for the dynamics of rotating disks',\n"," 'detecting high density compact outflow from the youngest yso in taurus recent theoretical simulations show that low velocity flows of km s are driven from the adiabatic protostellar core the first core and that most of the initial angular momentum of the natal dense cores has been transferred during this stage it is therefore of vital importance to investigate the first core objects as well as the outflow at this stage in this proposal we will carry out observations toward a dense core that contains the youngest protostar in taurus mc or l f in the lines of hco and hcn with multiple pointings and in the lines of h co cs and sio with a single pointing the cso observation in hco showed that compact outflow wing is clearly seen only at the center pointing and we found that this is due to the existence of high density compact outflow originated from the central source the proposed observation will be able to investigate the physical properties of the very young outflow giving us invaluable information to solve how the initial angular momentum is distributed during the phase observationally',\n"," 'submillimeter observations of a luminous fast blue optical transient luminous fast blue optical transients lfbots are a new class of cosmic explosions powered by active compact objects magnetars or accreting black holes the first new such class discovered in over a decade until recently the only lfbot with detailed multiwavelength

frame making this the most luminous lfbot at submillimeter wavelengths submillimeter observations offer a unique diagnostic of energetic blastwaves there is an extensive multiwavelength campaign to observe at tsd across the electromagnetic spectrum including swift xrt and m class optical telescopes to complement observations at lower frequencies ghz we request observations in bands the proposed observations combined with decimeter to centimeter observations and swift x ray monitoring will enable measurements of the circum explosion density the blastwave energy and the microphysics of this most unusual shock',\n"," 'fully characterization of streamers in the embedded phases of star formation the classic picture of star formation follows the evolution of an isolated spherical dense core in this picture all the material used in the star and planet formation process must go through the dense core clearly this an idealization but it has helped to move forward our understanding of star formation recent observations have revealed streamers of gas toward objects at different evolutionary stages from embedded class to more evolved class ii sources this evidence for non sperical accretion could deliver an important amount of mass and with a large enough mass infall rate that could severly change the disk formation and evolution process unfortunately until now no systematic study has been able to determine the streamers full lengths and properties this proposal will observe a sample of objects with strong suggestions for streamers in a systematic fashion to address these questions these observations will enable the direct kinematical confirmation of the full extent of these streamers and it will allow for a comparison of the properties across different evolutionary stages',\n"," 'validating disk based dynamical masses with young binaries a more robust knowledge of young star masses would be incredibly valuable in many aspects of star and planet formation in principle we can derive precise uncertainties of a few dynamical masses from the rotation curves of molecular gas disks that orbit young stars but in practice that disk based technique relies on a complex modeling process its absolute accuracy is not clear there is a straightforward way of validating this technique which relies on observing the few systems where two independent dynamical mass estimates are available spectroscopic binaries with circumbinary disks by comparing constraints from observations of co gas in these disks with those from radial velocity variations from the stars we can validate the disk based method for estimating stellar masses ultimately the results of this approach could then be applied to any isolated single young star with confidence vastly increasing the database of dynamical stellar masses to that end we propose to observe the co co c o j lines from the three disks known to orbit young spectroscopic binaries gw ori uz tau e and dq tau that do not yet have firm dynamical mass measurements',\n"," 'understanding magnetic field morphologies of star formation depending on observational size scales in order to investigate magnetic field morphology in au to au scales we propose for polarimetric observations toward two class protostellar systems which have strong polarization detection in our carma observations recently a discrepancy in magnetic field morphology has been reported over different target samples and scales magnetic fields aligned or misaligned along bipolar outflows our observations will shed a light on where the discrepancy comes from whether it is due to different scale sensitive observations and what the detailed magnetic field looks like indeed these results will provide insights about the relationship between magnetic fields and disk formation at the early evolutionary stage as well as about the magnetic field roles in star formation',\n"," 'as uds clustering of identified submillimeter galaxies we propose band continuum follow up observations of an uniformly selected sample of submillimeter sources with s mjy from our scuba survey of the ukidss uds we expect to precisely locate almost smgs with s mjy with this unprecedented large number of smgs with precise positions our science goals are to measure the angular correlation function and so derive the halo mass building the evolutionary links between smgs and other high z galaxy populations and their local desendants test whether brighter smgs are more likely to break up into multiple faint components and derive intrinsic number counts precisely identify the counterparts in other wavelengths and so derive redshift distributions in particular the form of the high z tail with a sample of smgs times larger than that of previously samples such as aless we will measure the multi wavelength properties of the population redshift distribution and most critically their clustering allowing us to properly link smgs with their proposed descendants

how and why are rooted in the stromgren models with only a few numerical simulations moving beyond this e g keto peters et al in order to understand the dynamics feedback and disruption of molecular clouds caused by massive stars shortly after they form hii regions requires high resolution sub mm observations from these observations we can determine how the hii regions expand leading towards answering why here we propose band observations at of small hii regions we will use h a to trace the dynamics of the ionised gas and three molecular species to trace the warm and dense gas around the hii regions through high sensitivity observations at the same resolution in both gas populations ionised and molecular we can understand the interaction between the hii region and its surrounding material as the ionisation front expands into it',\n"," 'magnetic fields from infrared dark clouds to hot molecular cores the importance of magnetic fields during the formation of high mass stars is an ongoing topic of strong discussion while previous observatories could only scratch the surface with we can now investigate the impact of magnetic fields during the evolution of high mass star

the ssa field is the archetypal and best studied system of its class a kpc scale emission line nebula at z lab epitomizes many of the key features of our current model of galaxy formation the extended

suggests that the central galaxy is driving a cold clumpy outflow off which ly a photons leaking from the central smg are scattering lab is therefore a unique laboratory for studying the interplay between luminous high z galaxies and their circumgalactic medium the physics of which is a key part of all galaxy formation models since this is the environment where gravitational cooling and

continuation of a b ranked program in cycle to observe massive cold and highly deuterated cores next to warm hot star forming cores discovered in the carma sma and jvla observations these cold cores

of high mass star formation we observed two of the five regions during in cycle the data delivered recently showed that our scientific goals of revealing the fragmentation turbulence and dynamical properties of the cores could be fully achieved with the proposed observations here we propose to observe the remaining three regions in our sample a preliminary analysis of the existing data showed that the completion of this project could significantly advance our knowledge of initial conditions of high mass star formation',\n"," 'physical properties of galaxies that ionize the universe measuring the properties of low luminosity galaxies near redshift is central to understanding the reionization of the universe although hundreds of bright galaxies have now been identified at this era their number density is too low to even maintain the ionization of the intergalactic gas and lower luminosity galaxies detectable only via their line emission provide the closest relation between any post reionization galaxy population and the objects that actually reionized the universe prior to however our knowledge of these important galaxies was limited to number counts and luminosity functions of hydrogen lyman alpha emission the luminosity and line profile of this resonance line depend sensitively on the gas kinematics and dust content of the host galaxy so lyman alpha

hosting a heavily obscured compton thick qso these observations will provide an order of magnitude improvement in the accuracy of the far infrared luminosity measurement and of all physical quantities related to l fir in addition these sub arsec resolution data obtained in the extended array configuration will quantify the compactness of the star forming region and possibly show signatures of a major merger our science goals will be achieved in es in less than hr including calibration in all bands',\n"," 'timing the birth of the red sequence one of the most remarkable recent discoveries in galaxy evolution studies is that up to half of the most massive galaxies at z are old quiescent systems with extremely compact structure it is a major puzzle how these systems have assembled their large stellar mass contents at such early cosmic times starbursting and dust enshrouded high reshift z submillimeter galaxies smgs are thought to be their most likely progenitors we have only recently been able to assemble the first unique sample of spectroscopically confirmed z smgs in the cosmos field using the improved capabilities in cycle allowing us to reach angular resolutions matched to that of hst we propose for band continuum observations at resolution towards our z smgs to infer the sizes of their star formation regions and directly link them to the sizes of the compact stellar remnants at z at the same time these observations will also allow us to constrain dynamical masses based on transitions of atomic lines falling in our observing windows both accurate size and

number densities do match in our target field cosmos',\n"," 'do unusually cold submillimeter galaxies exist luminous dusty starburst galaxies selected at submillimeter wavelength show a remarkably narrow range in dust temperatures of about a factor of which are primarily due to differences in their star formation rate surface density and hence the density of massive stars heating the dust potential trends with redshift have been discussed as a secondary possibility but it remains unclear if these can be cleanly separated from the selection functions of existing samples for these reasons the few known outliers from the general trends are particularly interesting to understand if multiple processes are at play we have recently serendipitously discovered that a major outlier from a sample of sources identified as a z galaxy with a tdust of only k in the literature may have been misidentified and rather is a z source with a normal tdust given the apparently contradictory findings from different studies of this source we here ask for a min integration with the aca on the cii um line to independently confirm our findings this will be important to clean up the debate

evidence for internal shocks in novae that dust forms at radiative shock fronts internal to the ejecta the image will allow a clear discrimination between this model and one in which dust forms in isotropic clumps with direct implications for dust formation in other energetic outflows',\n"," 'the ionizing flux in lensed galaxies at z the cosmic star formation rate density varies as a function of cosmological redshift peaking around z enhanced star formation produces a stronger x ray flux and larger cosmic ray flux both of which influence interstellar chemistry through ionization of h and h by observing the oxygen bearing ions oh and h o we can infer the ionization rate due to particles and photons offers the potential to study the ground state transitions of these two molecules in z galaxies providing the very first opportunity to constrain the total ionizing flux in such objects we select lensed submillimeter bright galaxies as our targets all of which show ch absorption which traces neutral mostly atomic gas where oh and h o are expected to form star formation rates in these galaxies vary from to m sun per year and we expect positive correlation between star formation rate

line scan program we discovered hco from the ejecta of supernova a the estimated hco mass was about orders of magnitude greater than the mass predicted by chemical models in order to determine where

nuclear burning zones if a supernova sustained this geometrical structure after the explosion hco cannot be formed hydrogen atoms are from the hydrogen envelope while carbon and oxygen atoms are from the helium envelope and carbon oxygen nuclear burning zones the likely way to form hco is that mixing of elements from different nuclear burning zones took place immediately after the supernova

of nearby winds via the brightest tracer co however co is easily dissociated into ci when exposed to energetic radiation in powerful starburst or agn driven winds thus much of the molecular mass is missed by co consequently the molecular mass outflow rates and energetics of the winds crucial parameters for understanding the driving mechanisms and impact of galactic scale winds on the evolution

excitation temperature for these molecules compared to oxygen bearing complex organics that desorb around the water snowline k we propose a pilot program toward two nearby high mass protostars that exhibit signatures of carbon grain sublimation these observations will spatially resolve the soot line and are able to reveal whether an enhancement in column density of nitrogen bearing molecules

our cycle survey of disks in the taurus star forming region at resolution shows that mm dust disk radii in binary systems are among the smallest in the sample and are as small as times the projected separation of the binary stars these values are explainable by a tidal truncation event but only if the eccentricity of the orbits is larger than very eccentric orbits would strongly impact the possibility of forming planets in these disks as their radii would be just a few au we propose here to obtain the still missing observation of co in these disks around multiple stars in the taurus

masses correlate most tightly with the stellar velocity dispersion of their hosts but whether the same relation holds for early and late type galaxies remains an open question various works suggest that massive ltgs follow an m sigma relation with a similar slope but lower normalisation than etgs this lower smbh mass at fixed sigma is typically regarded as evidence for the role of smbh accretion in quenching however making strong conclusions is hindered by systematic differences in the techniques used to measure smbh masses in these different objects molecular gas smbh measurements are the ideal tool to remove this uncertainty we here propose to begin to answer this question in a targeted manner using aca observations for a sample of galaxies in a narrow velocity dispersion range to map

for the exo planet forming disks the gas mass of planet forming disks is a crucial ingredient for our understanding of planet formation we propose to measure accurate gas masses for the sources in the large program exo s first exoplanet hunting campaign by observing n h in the sources where this line has not yet been observed measuring gas masses is difficult with the most readily available gas mass tracer co having been shown to have up to two orders of magnitude uncertainty due to a lack of constraints on the co abundance n h a chemical tracer sensitive to the co abundance was recently shown to observationally measure the co to h ratio and gas disk mass when combined with co isotopologue lines providing a path to measuring accurate gas masses we will combine the requested observations with archival n h and co observations to measure gas masses and co to h ratio for the exo disks the sample of disks most thoroughly searched for exoplanets with and with the best characterization of these planets linking these two the gas reservoir and the young planets that are actively forming in it will provide a massive leap in our understanding of planet formation',\n"," 'resolved direct imaging of the obscured star forming regions in smgs submillimeter luminous galaxies smgs are extremophiles in the spectrum of high z star forming galaxies with star formation rates higher than almost all other objects in the known universe yet despite their enormous luminosities a number of factors conspire faintness dust obscuration in the optical limiting resolution of longer wavelength telescopes which leave few clues as to the actual distribution of the star formation or what is triggering their massive bursts with in cycle the situation is fundamentally changed the resolution sensitivity is now such that one can resolve the obscured star forming regions in smgs in the rest frame far infrared fir the most direct tracer of star formation in dusty starburst galaxies at resolutions comparable to what herschel has achieved in nearby galaxies kpc to this end we propose micron band imaging of a statistically significant sample of smgs employing s most extended configuration the proposed targets were carefully selected from our cycle compact array survey of smgs the largest most homogenous and highest sensitivity sample of interferometrically observed smgs to date and they all have deep existing or forthcoming hst wfc imaging we will spatially resolve the obscured star forming regions in these confirmed smgs on scales down to equivalent to kpc at the median redshift of z directly addressing two of the biggest observational unknowns regarding the smg population how is the star formation distributed and what are the star formation rate densities of the starbursts this proposal will provide the observational foundation necessary to discriminate between the various models which have been put forward to explain the extreme star formation rates of smgs including major mergers isolated disks undergoing secular bursts cosmological gas accretion or some combination thereof requiring just hours this project is possible for the first time with in cycle and it will produce significant scientific results in an area that until now existed firmly in the realm of theory',\n"," 'ortho h d in the cores close to the onset of star formation we propose to observe the ortho h d line at ghz from two starless cores and one protostellar core in the orion molecular complex two starless cores g n and g s are considered to be evolved prestellar cores on the verge of star formation because of their high d h ratio of and high h volume density of cm the protostellar core g ne harbors a source with very low luminosity l sun and low bolometric temperature k the deuterated molecules such as n d and dnc are also abundant in this core suggesting that this core is just after the onset of star formation the ortho h d observations with the aca allow us to study the spatial distribution of the ortho h d line at a resolution of au we are able to study the variation of the orho h d abundance as a function of evolutionary stage the orho h d emission line also allows us to study the kinematics of dense and cold region in which most of the molecules are depleted onto dust grains',\n"," 'a search for cold carbon rich accretion streams in a massive halo at z cold accretion of gas from the cosmic web sustains star formation and supermassive black hole activity across cosmic time theory predicts the gas is funneled into the core of massive halos through narrow and cold streams but direct observational evidence of them is scarce in this proposal we search for extended cold gas via the ci tracer in the environment of ro a massive protocluster of galaxies at z previous spatially and spectrally resolved observations of the diffuse lyman alpha lya emission associated with this protocluster showed tantalizing hints of inflowing motion along three narrow filaments that connect at the center of the system encouraged by the recent detection of molecular ci emitting streams in a similar lya nebula we expect to find the truly cold counterpart of the lya filaments finally witnessing the fuel of star formation being served into a growing halo',\n"," 'the historic apparition of comet p wirtanen unprecedented close up analysis of coma composition and physics cometary ices are believed to have been relatively unaltered since the birth of the solar system and their compositions provide a unique record of ice chemistry in the protosolar disk midplane the december apparition of comet p wirtanen provides a rare opportunity to observe a jupiter family comet and likely future mission target at extremely close geocentric distance au we propose to map the strong emission lines of hcn h co ch oh and cs at unprecedented km spatial resolution using while the extended flux sensitivity of aca will permit a full mm wave chemical inventory including hnc hc n ch cn nh cho so so plus dust debris continuum this will enable a deep exploration of the physical and chemical state of the inner coma including d outgassing jet

new stis image the observations will confirm or refute the recent collision of a pluto mass object in the disk and reveal the true visible wavelength scattering phase function which we will use to confirm or refute evidence for an unseen planet exterior to the belt and improve constraints on the composition of the disk',\n"," 'bursting water maser feature in orion kl in february an outburst of the ghz h o maser feature in orion kl has started after year silence this is the third time to detect such phenomena in orion kl followed by and in order to explore the origin of such enigmatic burst phenomenon we have been carrying out astrometric observations of the bursting h o maser feature in orion kl with vera vlbi exploration of radio astrometry we found the bursting maser is located at the compact ridge suggesting that the maser burst is likely to be caused by the interaction with the outflow from the radio source i and ambient dense gas however the physical properties in around the bursting maser feature are not well understood because of the lack of observational studies except for the h o maser itself furthermore it is still unclear why only the km s component s show such outburst episodically or with possible year periodicity it may imply a special condition to stimulate such maser burst one of the possibilities is an existence of unknown young stellar object in compact ridge interacting with the outflow from source i in order to investigate the physical properties of the bursting maser feature and its origin we propose monthly monitoring observations of the submillimeter h o maser lines in parallel to our vlbi observations of the ghz maser lines based on our multi transition observations of the h o lines we will constrain the physical properties of the bursting maser feature in addition we search for the submillimeter dust continuum source around the bursting maser feature the current maser burst is the best opportunity to explore this burst event that may never come again for another years and hence our project is most suitable for the cycle ',\n"," 'inner disk dust ring and spiral like structures in the circumstellar disk ab aurigae the disk of ab aurigae exhibits spectacular spiral patterns however previous explanations of the spiral formations are purely based on the morphologies due to the lack of the kinematic information we have started sma pdbi m observations toward ab aurigae to trace the kinematics of the spirals using co lines with resolution we found that spirals traced with co is accreting material from the envelope following the parabolic spiral like trajectories well above or below the disk plane the bases of these spirals are very close to the mm dust ring and therefore the material may accumulate near the edge of the dust ring how the material accretes further from this ring toward the central disk is another question more likely related to a tidal truncation by an unknown companion we propose to observe co co and c o lines so line and the dense disk using mm continuum with resolution we aim at tracing the bases of the spiral structures and resolve constrain the size and dust properties of the inner disk',\n"," 'lensing through cosmic time constraints on normal galaxies in the hst frontier fields we propose band imaging fwhm mjy sigma of the first massive strong lensing clusters in the hst

galaxy ngc this proposal challenges the long standing problem in barred galaxies that is why star formation sf in the bars is suppressed recently we made co observations towards the arm and bar of a nearby prototype strongly barred galaxy ngc with nobeyama m telescope and m array which has no sensitivity on extended diffuse molecular gases we find that only of the total co flux is detected with the m array in bar region this suggests that a large amount of diffuse molecular gas exists in the bar and and that it could be the key to understand the sf suppression therefore investigating why a large amount of diffuse molecular gases exists i e do not become gmcs in the bar is important based on our hydrodynamical simulation of ngc diffuse gases are distributed filamentary which is missed in the m array data we thus propose co observations toward ngc with m array to make the total co emission gmcs diffuse gases map at pc resolution combining the m data in order to detect the filaments and
